  "description": "Enjoy this story free until January 2nd\n\nNoah Beck and Siena Agudong reprise their roles as Drayton and Dallas and their sparks light up the pages of this novel adaptation of Tubi's Sidelined 2: Intercepted. This highly anticipated sequel proves that whether you watch then read or read and then watch, one thing is for sure, there will never be enough Drayton and Dallas!\n\n***\n\nWhen Drayton Lahey surprises his girlfriend, Dallas Bryan, by joining her in LA for college, they are ecstatic to be together-proving that true love has legs. Their whirlwind relationship had its ups and downs, but they're committed to each other and to making their dreams come true. Dallas is enrolled in an extremely competitive dance program, and Drayton's now the QB of his school's football team where he's expected to bring home a championship.\n\nBut life interrupts their bubble. As their dreams for the future diverge, bridging the gap growing between them becomes harder and harder-and fighting for their future isn't guaranteed.",
