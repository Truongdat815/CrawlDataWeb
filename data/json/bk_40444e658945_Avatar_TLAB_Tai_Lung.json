    "description": "Reborn into a world torn by the Hundred Year War, Tai Lung, the fallen warrior of the Jade Palace, is adrift in a new life. Haunted by the memories of his past failures and the teachings of Master Shifu, he now travels the world burdened by doubt.\nStruggling to reconcile his past with his new identity as a human and a firebender, his unparalleled strength inevitably draws him into the conflict. Thrown into the ranks of the invading nation, his presence begins to reshape the course of history.\nThis is the story of his search for a new purpose where he must confront his own shortcomings and decide what legacy he will forge in a world that was not his own.",
