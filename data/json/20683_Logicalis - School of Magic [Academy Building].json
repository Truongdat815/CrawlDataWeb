            "content_text": "Prologue\n\nThree Months Ago\n\nThe testing chamber at the Royal Academy smelled like old parchment and expectations.\n\nI stood in the center of a runic circle inscribed in white stone, one hand pressed against the standard testing crystal. The enchanted sphere was warm under my palm, pulsing with a rhythm that matched my heartbeat. The administrator had the kind of face that had seen a thousand hopeful students. She watched the crystal's glow with professional detachment.\n\nMy father stood near the door. I could feel him watching. Hoping.\n\nThe crystal's light intensified, cycling through colors. Blue, then violet, then settling into a steady amber glow that held for three long seconds before stabilizing. Runic numerals flickered into view on the crystal's surface: 45.\n\nThe administrator noted the result in her ledger. \"Forty-five Mi,\" she said. Her tone was the same one merchants used when discussing cargo that had arrived damaged but technically intact. \"Exactly.\"\n\nMy chest went tight. Exactly. Right at the Om Point. Wizard Om had proven that forty-five Mi was enough to crystallize Mana—the minimum threshold to become a wizard. The number everyone talked about. The line between possible and impossible.\n\n\"So I qualify,\" I said.\n\n\"Technically. But students at the minimum struggle. Your core would crystallize too slowly to keep pace with our curriculum.\"\n\n\"I can already cast,\" I said. \"Terra Form. I've been practicing for eight years—\"\n\nShe pulled a pre-written form from a stack. The academy seal at the top. \"The Royal Academy appreciates your interest. However, after careful consideration of your Mi value—\"\n\n\"I can demonstrate it right now.\" The desperation in my voice made me sound younger than fifteen. \"Let me show you—\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary.\" She slid the form across her desk. The word DECLINED was stamped in red at the bottom. \"We require comfortable margins above the Om Point. I'm sorry.\"\n\nMy father's hand landed on my shoulder. Heavy. Final. \"Thank you for your time,\" he said to the administrator. Then to me, voice low: \"Come on, Marcus. Let's go home.\"\n\nI didn't move. \"What margin? Forty-six Mi? Forty-seven? Where's the line?\"\n\n\"Each applicant is evaluated individually.\" She gestured at the form. \"But students below fifty Mi struggle. You'd be fighting an uphill battle.\"\n\n\"Then let me fight it. I can—\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be fair to you.\" Her tone had shifted to dismissal.\n\n\"Academia Midur accepts students at forty-five Mi,\" I heard myself say.\n\nSomething flickered across her face. Amusement? Pity? \"I wish you luck with that, then.\" She stood, indicating the meeting was over. She glanced at the application form. \"But I'd suggest having a backup plan. Your family is in the merchant trade—warehousing, it says here. That's a respectable future.\"\n\nMy father pulled me toward the door before I could say something that would make this worse.\n\nThe walk through the Royal Academy's halls felt longer than it had on the way in. Polished marble floors. Tapestries showing famous Archmages. Display cases with enchanted artifacts. Everything I'd imagined being part of.\n\n\"It's not over,\" I said when we reached the courtyard. \"Merchant's College in Fluminis. They accept students at forty-five Mi. I checked.\"\n\nMy father stopped walking. \"Marcus—\"\n\n\"They're newer. More practical. Less focused on theoretical magic.\" The words came fast, desperate. \"Their tuition is lower. I could—\"\n\n\"You want to travel to Fluminis and do this again?\" His voice was tired. \"Get rejected again?\"\n\n\"You don't know they'll reject me.\"\n\nHe looked at me for a long moment. Black eyes like mine, weathered by years building a merchant empire from my grandfather's single warehouse. The same eyes that had watched my mother die eight years ago.\n\n\"If that's what you need,\" he said finally. \"We'll go to Fluminis.\"\n\n~~~\n\nMerchant's College sat on the edge of Fluminis, a riverside city two days' ride northwest of Conducere. The buildings were newer than Royal Academy's ancient stone—practical brick and timber construction that looked more like a counting house than a citadel of magic.\n\nThe testing chamber was smaller. The administrator was younger—maybe thirty, wearing robes that had seen actual work instead of just ceremonies.\n\nThe testing crystal pulsed under my hand. Same rhythm. Same colors. Same amber glow settling into the same steady light. The runic numerals appeared: 45.\n\n\"Forty-five Mi.\" He didn't sound disappointed. Just matter-of-fact. \"Right at the Om Point.\"\n\nHope sparked in my chest. \"So—\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, that's still below our practical range.\" He leaned forward, earnest. \"Look, I'll be honest. At forty-five Mi, your core will crystallize too slowly. While other students are learning to cast, you'd still be building Mana just to practice.\"\n\nI opened my mouth to argue, but what was the point? He'd already made his decision.\n\n\"Our training assumes you're starting from zero,\" he continued. \"You'd be paying for a foundation you can't build at the pace we teach.\"\n\nMy father stood silent this time. Letting me handle it.\n\n\"What about the trade track?\" I tried. \"I could—\"\n\n\"The trade track doesn't include spell casting instruction.\" His expression shifted—kind, but final. \"That's for enchanting support, alchemy assistance. Jobs that work alongside mages.\"\n\nThe words landed. Not being a mage. Working alongside them.\n\n\"Have you considered Qi development instead?\" he continued. \"You're young, strong—Sage training might be a better fit.\"\n\nThe words landed like a punch.\n\n\"Thank you for your time,\" I managed. Stood before my father could pull me away this time. \"I appreciate you seeing us.\"\n\nOutside, the river wind was cold despite the early autumn sun. Merchantmen moved up and down the waterway, hauling cargo, loading boats. The kind of life my father wanted for me.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" my father said quietly.\n\n\"Don't.\" I couldn't look at him. \"Just... don't.\"\n\nWe rode back to Conducere in silence. Two days of watching the road pass, my father occasionally trying to start conversations that died before they began, me counting everything I'd given up for forty-five Mi that wasn't enough.\n\nExactly enough to know I could crystallize Mana.\n\nExactly not enough for anyone to care.\n\n~~~\n\nSupport creative writers by reading their stories on Royal Road, not stolen versions.\n\nThree Months Later\n\n\"Again.\"\n\nRicardo's practice blade came in before I'd fully reset my stance. I barely got my practice sword up in time, the impact jarring my wrists. The blunted claymore was the exact weight and balance of my real one—custom-made as a matched pair—but the edges wouldn't cut. Just bruise if you were stupid enough to let them connect. He didn't give me space to recover—just kept pressing, forcing me back across the training yard's packed earth.\n\nThe morning sun was murder. Solis—the day before my name day—which meant everyone else was busy with preparations and no one was around to witness me getting my ass handed to me by a man whose Qi mastery had given him a lifespan most couldn't imagine.\n\nI parried, retreated, looked for an opening that wasn't there. Ricardo's wooden sword was just practice weight, but the man behind it had been Head of City Guard in Conducere before he retired. Decades of keeping the capital safe, training warriors, commanding the watch. Bald head gleaming with sweat that somehow never seemed to actually tire him, that ridiculous mustache bouncing with every strike like the universe's joke at my expense.\n\nFive years of this. Five years of bruises and blisters and that absurd mustache mocking me.\n\n\"You're thinking too much,\" he said, not even breathing hard.\n\n\"I'm thinking about survival.\"\n\n\"Same problem.\"\n\nHis next strike came low. I blocked, shifted my weight, and—there. The earth rose beneath his lead foot. Just two inches, barely visible, but his balance broke for a heartbeat. I stepped in and put my blade to his throat.\n\n\"Better.\" Ricardo didn't move. \"How long did that take?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"From recognizing the opening to casting. How long?\"\n\nI lowered my sword. \"I don't know. A second?\"\n\n\"Try again. And this time, I want it instant.\"\n\nWe reset. He came at me harder this time—no testing, no probing, just immediate violence. The kind that gets you killed if you hesitate. I gave ground, parried twice, felt the rhythm of the Wind-Cutting form taking over, and when the opening came I didn't think. Just cast.\n\nThe earth rose. Ricardo's foot caught, his balance failed, and I swept his legs with the flat of my blade. He went down but rolled clear before I could follow up.\n\n\"Good.\" He stood, brushed dust from his trousers. \"Again. Three times this round.\"\n\n\"Ricardo—\"\n\n\"Three times. Beginning, middle, end. Don't think. Just flow.\"\n\nThe first Terra Form was instinct—muscle memory from eight years of practice. My mother had taught me the spell when I was seven, her hands guiding mine through the gesture while the smell of turned earth filled my lungs. \"Feel the ground, Marcus. It's not separate from you.\" Her voice had been warm, patient. She'd let me help reshape the garden beds, laughing when I made the soil rise in uneven lumps. Back when I still thought forty-five Mi would be enough. Back when she was still alive.\n\nRicardo adjusted to the rise but I'd already shifted angles. Second exchange, blade work only, testing each other. Then he committed to a high strike and I dropped low, sword up to redirect, and the second rise erupted right where he was pivoting.\n\nHis wooden blade still caught my shoulder. Going to bruise.\n\nBut his balance was broken and I was inside his guard. Third rise as his back foot planted. He stumbled. I shoved. He sat down hard on the ground.\n\nFor a moment neither of us moved. Then Ricardo started laughing.\n\n\"Five years,\" he said, still sitting there. \"Five years of you complaining about every drill, every form, every hour in this yard. And that's the first time you've used Terra Form like it's actually part of you instead of something separate you have to remember to do.\"\n\nI lowered my sword. \"What's your point?\"\n\n\"My point—\" He stood, slower than usual. Was he actually winded? \"—is that you keep thinking magic and fighting are different things. They're not. Not for you.\"\n\n\"Easy for you to say. You can use Qi enhancement whenever you want.\"\n\n\"And you can reshape the ground while swinging a sword.\" He walked to the water barrel. \"Most mages can't cast and move. Most warriors can't cast at all. You're doing both and you don't even realize it.\"\n\nI jammed my practice blade into the weapon rack. \"Doesn't matter. They care about Mi values and how many spells you know and whether your family name opens the right doors.\"\n\nRicardo drank, then handed me the ladle. \"You've been practicing Terra Form every morning before our sessions. Alone. In the dark.\" He leaned against the barrel. \"You think I don't notice when my student is running the same spell over and over like he's trying to memorize his own bones?\"\n\n\"It's the only spell I can cast.\"\n\n\"It's the only spell your mother taught you.\" His voice went quiet. \"The one she used for the gardens. The one she was teaching you the day before...\"\n\n\"Don't.\"\n\nHe nodded. Didn't push. That was one thing I could say for Ricardo—he knew when to shut up.\n\nI looked at my hands. Calloused. Scarred from that time I'd tried to inscribe practice runes and slipped. Permanently stained with dirt from a hundred solo training sessions. These weren't a merchant's hands. Weren't a wizard's either.\n\n\"Your father thought you'd finally accepted it,\" Ricardo said finally. His eyes narrowed. \"But something changed.\" He studied my face. \"Tomorrow's your name day. Day after that—where are you going?\"\n\nMy jaw clenched. \"Nowhere.\"\n\n\"Don't lie to me.\" Ricardo's tone cut through my deflection. \"I've known you since the day you were born. So where? One of the coastal academies? Storm's Tower in Vallis?\"\n\nI held his gaze. Said nothing.\n\n\"Mali,\" Ricardo said quietly, reading my silence. \"Academia Midur. Of course.\"\n\n\"Mali's the most prestigious academy in the world,\" Ricardo said. \"Why would they accept you when Mercari's academies didn't?\"\n\n\"They test casting, not just Mi values.\" I set the ladle down. \"The book said they require at least three spell demonstrations. I only have one, but they'll actually watch me try. That's more than Royal Academy did.\"\n\n\"Three spells. You have one.\" Ricardo's voice was flat. \"And a couple months of travel to somehow learn two more.\"\n\n\"I know the odds.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" He gripped my shoulder. \"You're running toward the place most likely to reject you. So I'll ask again—what are you really running from?\"\n\n\"I'm not running from anything. I'm—\"\n\n\"You're attending your name day celebration tomorrow.\" He picked up his practice sword. \"Then the day after, you're going to disappear. So what are you really running from?\"\n\nSomething in his expression shifted—something distant and grieving. He'd lost his own son decades ago, a Beast hunter named Veer. Maybe he saw him in me. Another young man walking toward danger.\n\nMy jaw clenched. \"You going to tell my father?\"\n\n\"Would it stop you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then what would be the point?\" He moved to the center of the yard, took a ready stance. \"One more round. But this time I want you to fight like you mean it. No holding back. No thinking. Just you, your sword, and whatever magic you've got.\"\n\nI pulled my practice blade from the rack. The blunted claymore felt right in my hands—same weight as my real sword, same balance, same reach. Five years of drilling with this exact weapon until every movement was muscle memory.\n\n\"And if I actually cut you?\" I asked. \"Wait, wrong sword for that.\"\n\n\"Then I'll have an excuse for why a fifteen-year-old with a blunted sword beat me.\" That damned mustache twitched. \"Come on. Show me what you're taking to Mali. Show me what you think is going to change their minds.\"\n\nI didn't give him time to finish the sentence.\n\nThe fight was different this time. Faster. Harder. Every form I'd drilled for five years, every trick I'd learned, every desperate hour I'd spent trying to make Terra Form work while moving. The earth rose and fell like the yard was breathing. Ricardo's blade found me twice—shoulder, ribs—but mine found his guard three times and his balance four.\n\nWe ended with both our swords at each other's throats, both of us breathing hard for the first time I could remember.\n\nWell, I was breathing hard. Ricardo just looked mildly exerted, which was more than I'd ever gotten from him before.\n\n\"That,\" Ricardo said quietly, \"is not bad for someone 'not enough.'\"\n\nI lowered my blade first. He did the same. Then something occurred to me—something that should have been obvious five years ago.\n\n\"You were matching my Qi level.\"\n\n\"Of course I was. I've been matching it for five years.\" He smiled. \"Good training means calibrating the difficulty.\"\n\nHe is nearly a Sage. He could jump over this courtyard wall without breaking stride, move faster than I could track. But he'd been fighting at my level. Teaching me properly.\n\n\"I held my own for three minutes,\" I said slowly, \"against someone with more decades of combat experience than I've been alive. Using sword work and one utility spell.\"\n\n\"You did.\" He gripped my shoulder. \"You've learned to use everything you have instead of wishing for what you don't. That's rarer than you think.\"\n\nWe stood there in the morning sun, sweat dripping, neither quite willing to break the moment.\n\n\"You're not running from your father,\" he said finally. \"Or the academies.\"\n\n\"Then what am I running from?\"\n\n\"The person you'll become if you accept this.\" His grip on my shoulder was firm. \"Your mother taught you one spell. That wasn't an accident.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"She was teaching me more. Before she—\"\n\n\"But she made sure you had one they couldn't take away.\" His voice went quiet. \"I've known you since birth, helped your father raise you. Now, I'm watching you leave.\"\n\n\"Ricardo—\"\n\n\"Being stuck between warrior and mage is only a weakness if you keep trying to be one or the other.\" He glanced back. \"Remember that.\"\n\nThen he was gone.\n\nI stood alone in the empty training yard with my sword, my one spell, and the truth we both knew but hadn't said out loud.\n\nThe morning sun was already climbing. Soon Catherine would call me in for breakfast. Soon I'd have to face my father and pretend I wasn't planning to betray him. Soon I'd have to smile through a celebration knowing it was goodbye.\n\nI picked up my practice blade one more time. Ran through the opening sequence of Wind-Cutting form—the same movements I'd drilled a thousand times under Ricardo's watching eye. My body knew every step. Terra Form rising at the second pivot, just like he'd taught me. The earth responded, a two-inch rise exactly where my opponent's foot would be.\n\nBut there was no opponent now. Just me and the empty yard and the knowledge that tomorrow, all of this would be memory.\n\nTomorrow was my name day—Aestus Prima, the festival day I was actually born. I'd already turned fifteen back at Initium along with everyone else in the world, but tomorrow was the personal celebration. The day my family marked as mine.\n\nAnd that night, after everyone slept, I'd steal my father's coin pouch from behind my mother's painting, leave a note, and disappear before dawn to find out if the City of Magic—if Academia Midur itself—had room for someone who was exactly enough and not a drop more.\n\nI looked down at my hands one more time. Calloused. Scarred. Stained with dirt from practicing magic alone in the dark.\n\nNot a merchant's hands.\n\nNot a wizard's hands either.\n\nNot yet.\n\nI racked the practice blade next to its twin—my real claymore, sharp-edged and waiting. That one would come with me. The practice sword would stay here, gathering dust in a training yard I didn't know if I'd see again.\n\nI headed for the house. I had a celebration to attend, a family to say goodbye to without them knowing it was goodbye, and one day left to be the person I was before I found out what I could become.",

            "title": "1.1 The Name Day Departure",
            "content_text": "Chapter 1 - The Name Day Departure\n\n\"Marcus!\"\n\nCatherine found me in the courtyard mid-morning, sword oil and cleaning cloth in hand. I'd been avoiding the house since breakfast, staying with my real claymore and the familiar ritual of maintenance. The sharp one. The one I'd be taking with me when I left.\n\n\"There you are.\" She wiped her hands on her apron. \"Guests will arrive within the hour. You need to wash up and change into something that doesn't smell like the training yard.\"\n\n\"Guests?\" My stomach dropped. \"I thought this was just family.\"\n\n\"Your name day celebration? Of course there are guests.\" She gave me that look that said I should have known better. \"Your father invited the Marinos, the Castellis, and I believe young Lucia Theron is coming as well.\"\n\nGreat. Not just a quiet goodbye—a whole production with the children of my father's business associates. Children I'd grown up around, trained with, competed against for tutors' attention. All of them watching me celebrate turning into my father's heir instead of the wizard I'd wanted to be.\n\n\"I'll be up in a minute,\" I said.\n\n\"Marcus.\" Catherine's voice softened. \"I know you don't want a fuss. But it's one afternoon. For your father. Can you manage that?\"\n\nI nodded. She studied me for a moment longer—not the way she looked when checking if I'd washed properly, but something else. Something searching. Her eyes dropped to the claymore at my feet, then back to my face.\n\n\"Just one afternoon,\" she said quietly, then headed back to the kitchen.\n\nI looked down at my claymore—the real one, oiled and sharp. Still needed to pack it carefully so the edge wouldn't cut through my travel clothes. Along with the coin pouch, the note I'd written and rewritten three times.\n\nOne afternoon. I could manage one afternoon.\n\nThen I'd be gone.\n\n~~~\n\nI knew I should head in and clean up like Catherine asked, but I stopped by the stable first. I hadn't taken Thunderhoof out today—too busy avoiding the house—and I needed to check on him. Make sure he was ready for tomorrow.\n\nKyle was there with Matthew, who'd apparently brushed Thunderhoof three times already. The seven-year-old looked up when I entered, grinning with that absolute certainty that he'd done something important.\n\n\"Is everything perfect, Papa?\" Matthew asked Kyle. \"For Marcus's name day?\"\n\n\"Perfect enough.\" Kyle ruffled his son's hair. \"Go get Thunderhoof an apple. One apple.\"\n\nMatthew scurried off. Kyle waited until he was out of earshot, then lowered his voice. \"He did what he could reach. I redid the rest when he wasn't looking.\"\n\nThunderhoof turned his head and pressed his warm muzzle against my shoulder—the same greeting he'd given me every morning for five years. Steady. Patient. Unbothered by the chaos in my head.\n\n\"He looks great,\" I said. \"Thank you both.\"\n\nKyle nodded. \"We should clean up. Catherine will have my hide if we're late.\"\n\nI left them there—Matthew feeding Thunderhoof his apple, chattering about horse care, Kyle supervising with that patient tolerance only parents have.\n\nOne more thing I'd be leaving behind.\n\n~~~\n\nCatherine had transformed the main parlor—the room my father reserved for business guests and formal occasions—into something that was supposed to feel festive. Late afternoon sun slanted through the tall windows, casting everything in that golden light that was supposed to make gatherings feel warm and convivial. She'd set up a buffet along one wall: roasted meats, fresh bread, honey cakes, and enough wine to ensure everyone stayed longer than I wanted. The smell of roasted chicken mixed with sweet pastry and the sharp tang of wine.\n\nI claimed a chair in the sitting area near the opposite wall—upholstered chairs and a sofa arranged around a low table. My father stood near the windows—his usual post for receiving guests. Ricardo had already claimed the doorway, cup of wine in hand, watching everything with that quiet attention he always had.\n\nThe Marinos arrived first with their twin sons, Paulo and Rafael. Their parents joined my father near the windows. The twins crossed toward me with the same easy confidence they'd had walking out of the Royal Academy testing chamber three months ago—when their testing crystal had glowed seven Mi points brighter than mine.\n\nThey settled into the chairs flanking me, then launched into their upcoming enrollment. New robes. Master enchanters. Dormitory arrangements. Every detail delivered with the confidence of people who'd never been told they weren't enough.\n\nI gripped my wine cup and tried to smile at the appropriate moments.\n\nLucia Theron arrived next, sweeping into the parlor in a cloud of expensive perfume and silk. Unlike most merchant daughters, Lucia absolutely leaned into the fashion—blonde hair styled in elaborate braids woven with silver thread, emerald dress that probably cost more than Thunderhoof, jewelry that managed to look elegant rather than ostentatious.\n\nShe caught my eye from across the room, took in the twins holding court, and smiled with predatory precision.\n\n\"Paulo, Rafael!\" She glided over with a brightness that seemed genuine if you didn't know her well. \"I've been dying to hear about Royal Academy dormitory arrangements. The architecture alone must be fascinating.\"\n\nThe twins practically lit up at the new audience. Lucia perched on the arm of the sofa, positioning herself between me and them, and proceeded to ask increasingly detailed questions about matters no one actually cared about. Comparative advantages of different dormitory wings. Meal hall scheduling. The historical significance of the North Tower.\n\nI shot her a grateful look. She gave me the slightest wink.\n\nThen the Castellis arrived with wine and their daughter Isabella. The twins immediately abandoned Lucia—drawn to the larger audience of adults near the windows like moths to flame.\n\nIsabella crossed to the sitting area while her parents joined the cluster near the windows. She'd tested at thirty-eight Mi and accepted it with more grace than I'd managed—no desperate trips to second academies, no silent rides home, just a practical pivot to her mother's textile business. Now she was learning to inscribe preservation runes on expensive fabrics. Practical magic for practical people.\n\nDark hair in a simple braid, practical dress, callused fingers from textile work. She'd given up on elaborate fashion when she accepted her Mi score—said it got in the way of actual work.\n\nShe settled into one of the chairs the twins had vacated with the directness that made her either refreshing or unsettling. Lucia slid into the other, completing our small circle.\n\n\"You look miserable,\" Isabella said quietly while our fathers discussed shipping schedules across the room.\n\n\"That obvious?\"\n\n\"You're gripping that cup like you want to strangle it.\" She sipped her wine. The red liquid caught the afternoon light. \"And I saw the twins holding court when I came in. Let me guess—they were getting to you.\"\n\n\"The twins are fine.\"\n\n\"The twins are insufferable,\" Lucia said, examining her nails.\n\nIsabella smiled at her, then turned back to me. \"We both know you're one more 'Royal Academy this' and 'enchantment classes that' away from doing something you'd regret. Besides, it's your name day. You're allowed to have an actual conversation without those two performing their acceptance letters at you.\"\n\nI managed a real smile. \"You always did see through bullshit.\"\n\nIsabella set down her cup. \"So what are you going to do? Your father keeps telling mine you'll be starting at his main warehouse next month.\"\n\n\"Does he.\"\n\n\"But you're not, are you?\" Her eyes were sharp. \"You've got that look again. Like before the runic exhibition. What are you planning?\"\n\nI glanced across the room. My father was laughing at something old Castelli had said, his face relaxed in a way I hadn't seen in months. Since the rejections. Since the silent ride back from Fluminis. Since I'd stopped arguing about trying other academies. Ricardo caught my eye from across the room—just a brief look, a slight nod. He knew. Of course he knew.\n\n\"There is no plan,\" I lied.\n\n\"Marcus Logicali, you are a terrible liar.\" Lucia followed my gaze. \"He just wants you safe, you know. After your mother—\"\n\n\"I know what he wants.\"\n\n\"But it's not what you want.\" Isabella said.\n\n\"No,\" I admitted. \"It's not.\"\n\nIsabella and Lucia had been my closest friends since we were children. Where Isabella was blunt practicality and Lucia was calculated charm, I'd ended up as the stubborn idealist between them.\n\n\"We saw you come back from Royal Academy,\" Lucia said quietly. \"You wouldn't talk for days. Then Fluminis.\" She didn't finish. Didn't need to.\n\nI'd been quiet for weeks after that. Just training. Practicing Terra Form in the dark. Existing in the space between what I wanted and what I was allowed to have.\n\nUntil I'd started researching Academia Midur.\n\n\"You've got a plan,\" Isabella said. It wasn't a question.\n\nI looked at both of them. Friends who'd watched me get rejected twice while others succeeded. Who'd both accepted what they were, and watched me fail to.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" I lied.\n\nUnauthorized tale usage: if you spot this story on Amazon, report the violation.\n\nIsabella pressed, \"You mentioned Mali once. Before you went quiet.\"\n\n\"And I saw Historia Mali on your desk last week,\" Lucia added. \"You weren't subtle.\"\n\n\"Academia Midur,\" Isabella said. \"That's where you're going.\"\n\nI didn't answer. Didn't need to.\n\nIsabella leaned forward. \"I thought you might be planning this.\" She pulled a sealed letter from her sleeve and pressed it into my hand. \"I wrote this last night. My aunt lives in Portare. She runs a boarding house near the docks—the Tidewatch. Sailors, merchants, travelers. This is an introduction.\"\n\nI stared at the letter. \"Isabella—\"\n\n\"Her aunt knows people,\" Lucia added, reaching into her silk purse and pulling out a small coin purse. \"Ship captains. Merchants who trade with Regalis.\"\n\nShe thrust the purse into my other hand. \"Ten gold. It's not much, but it'll help you get there.\"\n\nI looked down at both hands—letter in one, coin in the other. \"I can't take this.\"\n\n\"You can and you will.\" Isabella's voice was firm. \"My aunt will help. The letter says you're pursuing magical education. True enough.\"\n\n\"Why are you helping me?\"\n\nIsabella squeezed the hand holding the letter. \"Because you haven't given up. And we're not letting you do this alone.\"\n\nBefore I could respond, my father called me over to meet Master Vittorio, his senior warehouse manager.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon blurred into performance. Smiling at my father's business associates. Accepting congratulations on \"becoming a man\" and \"joining the family business.\" Catching Isabella's and Lucia's eyes across the room, seeing their understanding reflected back.\n\nMy father looked happier than I'd seen him in months. Relaxed. Hopeful. Every smile I forced made the betrayal feel heavier.\n\n~~~\n\nThe guests departed as the sun set. Catherine served dinner—just family now. Her, Kyle, Matthew, my father, and me around the table in the dining room that suddenly felt too large.\n\n\"Open it,\" Kyle said, pushing a wrapped package across the table.\n\nInside was a wooden carving. Me. Carved in flamboyant Archmage robes with flowing sleeves and intricate runic patterns. A spell staff in one hand. A book hanging from my belt. The detail was exceptional—you could see the individual pages of the book, the grain of the wooden staff, even the way the robes seemed to move in an invisible wind. Kyle had real talent.\n\nAnd he'd carved me as the wizard I wanted to be.\n\nMy throat went tight.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" I managed.\n\n\"Thought you'd like having something that shows... well, what you wanted.\" Kyle glanced at my father, then back to me. \"Even if things didn't work out the way you planned. You can keep it on your desk. Reminder that we believe in you, whatever path you take.\"\n\nMy father's expression was complicated as he looked at the carving. Then he pushed another wrapped package across the table—larger, heavier. \"From me. For the warehouses.\"\n\nInside was a merchant's satchel. Fine leather, well-crafted, with multiple compartments and brass buckles. The kind senior merchants carried. Practical. Expensive. Everything a warehouse manager would need.\n\n\"Quality materials,\" my father said. \"Built to last. You'll be traveling between warehouses, managing shipments. This will serve you well.\" He paused. \"Your grandfather carried one like it. Lasted him thirty years.\"\n\nI looked between the two gifts. Kyle's wizard in elaborate robes, staff raised as if mid-spell. My father's practical leather satchel, built for a merchant's life of ledgers and cargo manifests.\n\nTwo futures. Two paths. Both given with love.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I managed, my voice rough. \"Both of you. These are... thank you.\"\n\nMatthew was already half-asleep, tired from helping his parents prepare all day. Kyle carried him off to their cottage. Catherine started clearing dishes.\n\nMy father poured two glasses of wine. His hands were steady—the same hands that had built a merchant empire from my grandfather's single warehouse. The same hands that had gripped my shoulder in the Royal Academy testing chamber three months ago. And again at Merchant's College. Black eyes like mine met mine across the table as he pushed a glass toward me.\n\n\"I know this isn't what you wanted,\" he said after Catherine had left us alone. \"Any of this.\"\n\nI stared at my wine.\n\n\"I took you to both academies, Marcus. Stood beside you in those testing chambers.\" His voice went rough. \"I watched them stamp DECLINED without even asking what you could do.\"\n\nThe two-day ride to Fluminis. The silent ride home.\n\n\"I know,\" I said.\n\n\"Do you?\" He leaned forward. \"Because I still see you in that training yard every morning. Practicing that spell like—\" He stopped. \"I can't watch you keep tearing yourself apart over Mi points you'll never have.\"\n\n\"I just want to learn.\"\n\n\"You've already learned.\" He took a drink. \"Your mother taught you Terra Form. She'd be proud of that.\" His knuckles were white around his cup. \"But the academies said no. Both of them.\"\n\nThe words hung between us.\n\n\"The warehouses,\" he continued quietly. \"There's dignity in that work. Security. A future you can actually build.\"\n\nEverything I wanted to say piled up in my throat—that there was a third option, that Mali might be different, that Academia Midur valued skill not just numbers, that I'd rather fail trying than succeed at something I didn't want.\n\nBut he'd already lost my mother. And tomorrow I'd be gone, and he'd lose me too.\n\n\"I know, father,\" I said instead. \"I'll think about it.\"\n\nHe smiled. Relieved. \"Good. That's all I ask. Think about it. Give the warehouses a chance. If in a year or two you still want to pursue magic, we can discuss other options. Private tutors, perhaps. There are mages who teach individually.\"\n\nI nodded. Let him believe the lie.\n\nWe finished our wine in silence. He went to bed. I waited another hour, listening to the house settle into silence.\n\nThen I went to his study.\n\nThe door was unlocked. It always was—my father never expected theft from within his own house. I stood in the doorway, listening to make sure no one else was awake. The house was silent. Catherine and her family asleep in their quarters. My father in his bed down the hall.\n\nI crossed to the painting of my mother on the far wall.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I whispered to her portrait.\n\nHer smile didn't change. She'd painted this herself, years before I was born. Her voice came back unbidden—warm, patient. Magic isn't about how much power you have, Marcus. It's about what you do with it.\n\nI'd been seven years old, hands still small in hers, learning to feel the earth's pulse in our garden. The smell of turned soil. Her fingers, always faintly earth-scented, guiding mine through the gesture. I'd made the soil rise in uneven lumps and she'd laughed, that bright sound that seemed to make the whole garden lighter.\n\nPromise me you'll never stop trying.\n\nI'd promised. And she'd smiled—the same smile captured in oils on the canvas now.\n\nShe didn't answer now. Dead people never do. But the promise remained.\n\nI lifted the painting carefully from its hooks. The wall compartment behind it was obvious once you knew to look—a hand-width square of stone that pressed inward, revealing a space just large enough for a leather pouch. My father thought he was clever. Merchants always did.\n\nThe pouch was heavy. I didn't count the coins—didn't want to know exactly how much I was stealing. Enough for passage to Portare. Enough for the ship to Regalis. Enough to survive in Mali while I figured out how to convince them to accept a student with exactly forty-five Mi and nothing more.\n\nI hung the painting back up, adjusting it until her smile was level. Then I left his chamber exactly as I'd found it. My father would discover the theft when he did his weekly counting. By then I'd be gone, and he'd have to decide if a wayward son was worth chasing.\n\nBack in my chamber, I pulled out the pack I'd hidden under my bed.\n\nTravel clothes. The claymore. The coin pouch—still warm from where I'd tucked it inside my shirt. And the note I needed to write.\n\nI looked at the two gifts on my desk. Kyle's carving—me as a wizard, staff raised. My father's satchel—fine leather, built to last thirty years like my grandfather's.\n\nThe carving went into my pack, wrapped carefully in a spare shirt. Too precious to leave behind, even if it hurt to look at. The satchel... I picked it up, tested the weight, opened the compartments. Practical. Well-made. Perfect for carrying documents, coins, supplies on the road.\n\nI'd use my father's gift to chase my mother's dream.\n\nI sat at my desk and pulled out a paper. The words I'd been composing in my head for weeks took only minutes to write:\n\nFather,\n\nI'm sorry. I know this isn't what you want. I know you're afraid of losing me like you lost Mother. But I can't become the person you want me to be without trying to become the person she believed I could be.\n\nI'm going to Mali. I'm going to find a way. And when I come back, it will be as a mage, not a warehouse manager.\n\nDon't come after me. I'm fifteen—a legal adult. This is my choice.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n- Marcus\n\nI read it one more time, then placed it on my pillow where he'd find it—probably tomorrow noon when he came looking for me. Maybe sooner if Catherine told him about my mood.\n\nI shouldered my pack.\n\nThe house was silent. I crept down the stairs, out through the kitchen, across the courtyard where I'd fought Ricardo just yesterday.\n\nThe training yard was dark and empty. The practice blade still rested in the rack where I'd left it. Matched pair—one sharp, one blunted. Ricardo had commissioned both five years ago when he'd started training me.\n\nI left the practice sword where it was.\n\nThe stable was quiet. Thunderhoof—my gray gelding—nickered softly when I approached, probably expecting our usual morning ride. I saddled him in the dark, moving by memory and habit.\n\nIn my pack: everything I'd stolen, everything I'd been given, and the belief that maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought.\n\nI led Thunderhoof quietly through the estate gate, not looking back at the house where I'd grown up.\n\nThe ride through Conducere's empty streets took an hour. I kept to the shadows, avoiding the night watch, my heart hammering every time I heard footsteps. By the time I reached the northern gate, the sky was just beginning to pale.\n\n~~~\n\nThe caravan gathered at Conducere's northern gate as the first light touched the horizon. Six wagons, a dozen guards, and maybe twenty passengers all heading north to Portare on Bahia's coast—seven days travel if weather held. Loren Wolf—the caravan master—was checking manifests when I approached with Thunderhoof.\n\n\"Name?\" he asked without looking up.\n\n\"Marcus. Passage for one, plus the horse.\"\n\n\"Destination?\"\n\n\"Portare.\"\n\n\"That'll be three gold.\" He finally looked at me. \"You look young for solo travel. Your parents know you're here?\"\n\n\"I'm fifteen. Legal age.\"\n\n\"Fifteen looks different on different people.\" He studied me, taking in the sword, the quality of my horse, the pack that probably cost more than most passengers owned. \"Rich kid running away?\"\n\n\"Rich kid traveling,\" I corrected.\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" He held out his hand. \"Three gold. Two for passage, one for the horse. We leave in ten minutes. You cause trouble, you walk. We get attacked by bandits, you help defend or you pay double. Questions?\"\n\nI handed him three coins. \"Where do I—\"\n\n\"Rear wagon. There's a kid about your age already there. Talks too much but he paid on time.\" Loren turned to the next passenger. \"Next!\"\n\nI led Thunderhoof to the rear of the caravan. A young man sat mounted on a worn pony, maybe nineteen or twenty, dark hair messy, grin too wide for the early hour. Older than me, but not by much.\n\n\"You the other solo traveler?\" he asked. \"Loren said I'd have company. Gustin Green.\" He stuck out his hand.\n\n\"Marcus.\" I shook it.\n\n\"First time on the northern route?\"\n\n\"First time leaving Conducere,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Ah, city kid.\" He said it without judgment, just observation. \"I'm from Planus—little village west of here. Took me five days just to get to Conducere.\" He patted his pony's neck. \"Been saving for this trip since I was twelve.\"\n\nThe caravan lurched into motion. I swung onto Thunderhoof's saddle. Gustin fell in beside me as we started north.\n\n\"So,\" he said after we'd cleared the gates. \"Where are you heading after Portare?\"\n\n\"Haven't decided yet.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Right. Well, I'm taking the ship to Regalis. Then Mali.\" He glanced at me. \"Academia Midur. Figured I'd see if this was worth the three years I spent saving for the journey.\"\n\nI was quiet for a moment, weighing whether to admit it.\n\n\"Same route?\" he asked.\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"That's a yes.\" He grinned and pulled folded paper from his jacket. \"Got my conditional acceptance two months ago. Provisional enrollment, pending testing on arrival.\"\n\nMy stomach dropped. \"Conditional acceptance?\"\n\n\"Yeah. They want me to demonstrate spell mastery when I get there.\" He waved the letter. \"My surrogate father wrote them—he's an alumni. Helped, I think.\"\n\n\"How many spells?\"\n\n\"Seven.\" He said it casually. \"What about you? You got your letter yet?\"\n\nThe answer stuck in my throat. \"What's your Mi value?\"\n\n\"Forty-eight. You?\"\n\n\"Forty-five.\"\n\nHis eyebrows rose. \"Right at the Point. That's... optimistic.\"\n\nI didn't answer. Didn't need to. The gap between us was already clear—three Mi points, seven spells, a conditional acceptance letter, an alumni connection.\n\nAnd I had one spell, no letter, and a desperate hope that Academia Midur would care.\n\nWe rode in silence for a while. Conducere's walls shrank behind us, the rising sun turning the eastern sky copper and gold.\n\n\"So no acceptance letter?\" Gustin asked finally.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But you're going anyway.\"\n\n\"I'm going anyway.\"\n\nHe was quiet for a moment. Then: \"That's either really brave or really stupid.\"\n\n\"Probably both.\"\n\n\"Fair enough.\" He tucked the letter away. \"Well, if they reject you on arrival, at least you'll have seen the City of Magic. That's worth something, right?\"\n\nI thought about Isabella and Lucia back in Conducere. The letter tucked in my pack felt heavier than it should. They'd helped me. Believed in me. Given me resources and connections when they could have told my father instead.\n\nAbout the twins and their insufferable confidence. About my father reading my note. About Ricardo's words in the training yard.\n\nYou're not running toward magic. You're running toward the work of becoming something no one expects.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, touching the pocket where Isabella's letter rested. \"It's worth something.\"\n\nThe road stretched ahead—days of travel, then the sea crossing, then Mali. And whatever came after that.\n\nGustin started talking—about his village in Planus, about the chief who'd tested him, about the seven spells he'd learned from the old mage before leaving. I listened and answered, watching Conducere's towers catch the morning sun behind us.\n\nSomewhere in that sprawling city, my father would be discovering I was gone. Catherine would find the note. Ricardo would see the empty training yard. Matthew would ask where I'd gone. Isabella and Lucia would know I'd left without saying goodbye.\n\nEverything I'd known—the estate, the training yard, my mother's grave, the comfortable cage of a predetermined life—shrank with each step until distance swallowed it all.\n\nI didn't look back again.\n\nAhead, the road stretched toward everything I'd gambled my life on.",

            "title": "1.2 The Road to Portare",
            "content_text": "Chapter 2 - The Road to Portare\n\nThe first night on the road, I couldn't sleep.\n\nWe'd made camp in a clearing just off the main route, six wagons circled for protection, a fire burning in the center. The horses—including Thunderhoof—were picketed on the far side of the circle, close enough to guard but far enough not to spook if something approached. Gustin had fallen asleep mid-sentence, curled up in his bedroll near the warmth. A few other passengers slept around the fire; most preferred the shelter of the wagons.\n\nThe guards rotated watches. I sat with my back against a wheel, watching the stars.\n\n\"Can't sleep either?\"\n\nI looked over. One of the wagon drivers—a woman maybe thirty years old, weathered from years on the road—settled down near the fire across from me.\n\n\"First time traveling?\" she asked.\n\n\"That obvious?\"\n\n\"Keep touching your pack. Checking it's still there.\" She poured herself tea from a pot hanging over the fire. \"Either first journey or carrying something you can't afford to lose.\"\n\n\"Both.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Helena. Been driving for Loren six years now. You?\"\n\n\"Marcus. Been running away for about twelve hours.\"\n\nThat got a laugh. \"Honest. I like that.\" She sipped her tea. \"Let me guess—heading to one of the academies? Parents don't approve?\"\n\n\"Parent. Singular. And no, he doesn't.\"\n\n\"But going anyway.\"\n\n\"I'm going anyway.\"\n\nHelena was quiet for a moment, steam rising from her cup. \"Tested at thirty-two when I was sixteen.\"\n\nI knew that number. Below the threshold. Below even mine.\n\nShe sipped her tea. \"Mother cried for a week. Kept saying maybe the test was wrong, maybe I'd grow into it.\"\n\n\"And your father?\"\n\n\"More practical. Suggested runic array etching—figured if I couldn't cast spells, at least I could help make 'em.\" She smiled slightly. \"Spent two years apprenticed to an enchanter in Conducere.\"\n\n\"In Conducere?\" I leaned forward. \"Which one?\"\n\n\"Master Aldwin's shop. Near the eastern market.\" She traced the rim of her cup. \"Learned to etch arrays onto scrolls, tools, focus stones. Good work. Steady.\"\n\n\"But you're driving wagons now.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She stared into her tea for a long moment. Somewhere in the darkness, one of the horses nickered softly. \"Turns out spending every day etching arrays for spells you'll never cast... that's its own kind of torture.\"\n\nI thought about my father's warehouses. The life he wanted me to accept.\n\n\"Watching mages come in,\" she continued, \"pick up your work, walk out and do things you never will.\" She shrugged, but there was weight in the gesture. \"After two years I couldn't take it anymore. Quit. Found Loren. Been driving ever since.\" She gestured at the wagon. \"Been all over Rivus now. Seen things most folk only hear about in stories.\"\n\n\"Do you regret it?\" I asked. \"Leaving the arrays?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. I was good at it. Real good.\" She considered. \"But mostly? No. Found my path. Maybe wasn't the one I wanted at sixteen, but it's mine. And I sleep better not being reminded every day of what I can't do.\"\n\nI looked back at the stars. \"What if you can't accept any other path? What if the one you want is the only one you'll walk, even if it's impossible?\"\n\nShe was quiet for a moment. \"Then you walk it until you can't anymore. Or until you prove it wasn't impossible after all.\" She stood, stretched. \"So what's your Mi value?\"\n\nI hesitated. \"Forty-five.\"\n\nShe nodded slowly. \"Right at the Point. Got your acceptance letter?\"\n\nI looked away. She didn't need to hear me say no.\n\n\"They'll use that against you. Not worth the risk, they'll say. Safer to teach you to accept your limits than let you try and fail.\" She sipped her tea. \"That's how they think. Academies ain't kind to disappointment.\"\n\nShe headed back to her wagon, leaving me with the fire and the stars and the weight of everything I'd left behind.\n\nI wondered if Catherine had found my note yet. If Matthew had asked where I'd gone. If Ricardo already knew I'd left the practice sword behind, and what he thought it meant.\n\nTwo days until Lorisfort. Four more after that to Portare. Then the ocean, Regalis, and Mali.\n\nAnd somewhere in there, I'd have to figure out what came after they rejected me.\n\nBecause they would reject me. Helena was right. Forty-five Mi was optimistic at best, delusional at worst.\n\nBut I was already here. Already gone. Already committed.\n\nSo I'd see it through.\n\nI finally drifted off sometime before dawn, dreaming of my mother's garden and earth rising at my command.\n\n~~~\n\nAfter two nights of sleeping under the stars, Lorisfort appeared on the third day like a promise of civilization.\n\nThe fortress city sat astride the main trade route, walls twice the height of any village we'd passed. Guard towers at each corner, the banner of Mercari flying above the gates—red and gold snapping in the wind. The smells hit us before we entered: forge smoke, horse dung, roasting meat, and underneath it all, the acrid tang of magic from the tower district. Inside, the sounds of commerce and life echoed—smiths hammering, merchants hawking, the organized chaos of a city that existed to serve the road.\n\n\"We're stopping here for the night,\" Loren announced as we approached. \"Resupply, let the horses rest. Anyone wants to stay longer, you're on your own. We leave at dawn for Portare.\"\n\nThe caravan rolled through the gates, wheels clattering on cobblestones worn smooth by centuries of traffic. Inside, Lorisfort was everything the villages hadn't been—crowded, loud, alive. Guild contracts were pinned to public boards. Taverns spilled patrons onto the streets, their laughter mixing with the cries of vendors. Merchants sold everything from daggers to enchanted trinkets, their stalls crowding the main thoroughfare so tightly we had to slow to a walk.\n\n\"Look at that,\" Gustin said, pointing to a building with a sign reading \"Guardians Guild.\" A massive Sher warrior emerged—battle axe across their back, golden fur catching the afternoon sun. Silver Guardians Guild badge on their chest.\n\n\"Long way from home,\" Gustin muttered, watching them disappear into the crowd. \"Wonder what contract brought them east.\"\n\nI'd seen Sher in Conducere—merchant guards, mostly. But never one wearing a Guild badge. \"Hunting something dangerous, probably.\"\n\n\"Glad we haven't run into bandits,\" Gustin said.\n\n\"Give it time,\" I said dryly. \"We've got four more days to Portare.\"\n\n~~~\n\nThat night, I bought Gustin and myself rooms at a proper inn. The Nobel Inn—two silver each, not cheap, but I could manage it. After days sleeping on hard ground, an actual bed seemed worth the cost.\n\nThe common room was loud when we entered. Travelers, locals, a few guards from the city watch. The smell of roasted meat and ale mixed with woodsmoke and sweat. We found seats near the back and ordered beef and weak ale.\n\nThe food arrived quickly—steaming beef, dark bread, butter that was probably a day from turning. \"Finally, real food,\" Gustin said, already tearing into the bread.\n\nI was about to agree when a voice cut through the ambient noise—loud, slightly slurred, carrying the particular confidence of someone three drinks past sober.\n\n\"—took down eight of 'em. Eight! And Bauros wasn't even wearing full plate.\" The speaker was a human man, maybe thirty, wearing travel-stained leathers with a Guild medallion on his chest. Silver rank. Guardian Guild. \"Just that massive axe and his honor. Red Canyon bandits thought they had an easy mark. One Sher traveling alone.\"\n\nHis companions laughed. Another Guardian—younger, maybe bronze rank—leaned forward. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"What d'you think happened?\" The older Guardian—Kerrick, someone had called him—grinned. \"Bauros introduced 'em to Narasimha's judgment. By the time the merchant caravan caught up, there were eight bodies and one very annoyed lion-folk cleaning blood off his fur.\"\n\n\"Impressive,\" the younger Guardian said.\n\n\"Impressive?\" Kerrick's voice rose. \"It's legendary! That route's been safe two months since. Every bandit from here to Vallis knows what happens when you threaten Guardian-protected cargo. The Sher's honor holds.\"\n\n\"Or,\" a new voice cut in, sharp and condescending, \"one combat mage could have neutralized the threat without the theatrics.\"\n\nI looked over. A young man—early twenties, dark hair pulled back, expensive robes with Lorisfort's mage tower insignia—sat at a nearby table with a book open in front of him. Long, pale fingers turned pages with deliberate precision. He hadn't looked up from whatever he was reading.\n\nKerrick's grin vanished. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"I said,\" the apprentice—Evander, I'd heard someone call him earlier—finally looked up, \"that a moderately skilled mage could have neutralized eight bandits with a single Blast spell. Or a Confusion charm. Or even a properly placed Barrier. Your friend's accomplishment is… quaint. But hardly efficient.\"\n\nThe tavern got quieter. Not silent—conversation continued—but people were paying attention now.\n\n\"Quaint.\" Kerrick's jaw worked. \"Bauros saved that caravan. Twelve merchants, their families, guards. All alive 'cause he was there.\"\n\n\"And I am certain they are grateful.\" The apprentice closed his book, sitting rigidly upright. \"But let us be honest. Qi warriors such as your Bauros are solving problems the difficult way. Magic is demonstrably superior in every practical measure.\"\n\n\"Superior?\" The younger Guardian spoke up now. \"When's the last time a wizard protected a trade route?\"\n\n\"When was the last time such protection proved necessary?\" The apprentice stood, warming to his argument. \"Guardian Guilds exist because magic remains uncommon. If more individuals possessed proper Mi values and training, your profession would become obsolete. You are, essentially, stopgaps. Necessary, perhaps, but hardly admirable.\"\n\n\"Stopgaps?\" Kerrick was on his feet too. \"We're stopgaps? Who supplies your precious Beast cores for research? Hunter Guilds. Who protects the merchants that feed your cities? Guardian Guilds. But sure, wave your hands and pretend you're superior while we do the actual work.\"\n\n\"The actual work?\" The apprentice laughed. \"Swinging swords at bandits is labor a trained dog could perform. Magic requires years of study, precise understanding of runic arrays, mental discipline—\"\n\n\"And seven, eight seconds to cast while glowing like a forge,\" Kerrick shot back. \"Your Blast's real impressive when you're dead before the spell completes. You start building that array, every bandit sees the shimmer, feels the heat. They scatter or fill you with arrows.\"\n\nA few people laughed. Others nodded. The apprentice's face reddened.\n\n\"If you possessed proper Mi values, you wouldn't require such primitive Qi enhancement. You're making a virtue of limitation.\"\n\n\"And you're making a religion of privilege.\" Kerrick stepped closer. \"Not everyone tests high enough for your fancy academies. Some of us develop Qi instead. Serve our communities. Protect people. But I guess that ain't noble enough for wizard-folk.\"\n\n\"It is not a matter of nobility. It is a matter of capability.\" The apprentice's voice dripped condescension. \"Qi users are valuable—I never suggested otherwise. But let us not pretend you are equals. A properly trained mage will always prove more effective.\"\n\n\"More effective at running when things get real,\" someone from Kerrick's table muttered.\n\n\"More effective at solving problems efficiently,\" the apprentice countered. \"Your Bauros spent what—ten minutes? Fifteen?—fighting eight men with an axe. One Blast spell. Eight seconds of casting, every bandit at the campfire burning. Problem resolved.\"\n\n\"IF you can cast it before they kill you. IF you got the Mana. IF you're actually there instead of hiding in your tower reading books.\" Kerrick's hands clenched. \"Guardians show up. We do the job. Every time. That's why merchants hire us instead of waiting for some wizard to maybe feel like helping.\"\n\n\"Merchants hire you because you are cheap.\"\n\nThe temperature in the tavern dropped. Even the people who'd been ignoring the argument turned to watch.\n\nKerrick's voice went very quiet. \"Say that again.\"\n\n\"I said you are cheap. Affordable. The budget option for those who cannot afford actual magical protection.\" The apprentice smiled. \"Which, again, is valuable. Society requires affordable services. But do not mistake affordability for superiority.\"\n\nFor a second, I thought Kerrick would throw a punch. His Qi was probably enhanced enough to hit like a sledgehammer. The apprentice's hands moved to gesture positions—preparing a shield spell, maybe.\n\n\"Enough.\" The tavern keeper—a barrel-chested Dwarf with a voice like grinding stone—stepped between them. \"You want to fight, take it outside. You want to drink, sit down and shut up. Choose.\"\n\nKerrick glared at the apprentice. The apprentice stared back, smug and certain.\n\n\"Not worth it,\" Kerrick finally said. He dropped coins on his table. \"Come on. This place smells like failed potential anyway.\" He and his companions headed for the door, Guild medallions catching lamplight.\n\nThe apprentice sat back down. His hands shook slightly as he opened his book, but within a minute he was reading again, pretending nothing had happened.\n\nConversation resumed slowly. The tension bled out. Within minutes, it was just another night at a busy tavern.\n\nI realized my hands were clenched around my fork.\n\n\"Well,\" Gustin said lightly, \"that was unpleasant.\"\n\nI forced myself to relax. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"That got ugly fast.\" Gustin took a drink, looking uncomfortable. He hesitated. \"I mean, what the apprentice said about efficiency—that's what they teach, right? Magic is more effective than Qi for most problems.\" He stared at his cup. \"But the way he said it. Calling them 'cheap'... that was cruel.\"\n\nSomething in my chest tightened. \"The Guardian made some points too.\"\n\nThe tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.\n\n\"He did.\" Gustin nodded slowly. \"The thing about wizards hiding in towers while Guardians do the actual protecting—that hit home.\" He smiled, but it was uncertain. \"Look, I respect what Guardian Guilds do. Honestly. But we're going to Mali to become mages, and I want that.\" He trailed off.\n\n\"Ricardo—my sword instructor—developed Qi,\" I heard myself say. \"He's one of the most capable people I know.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he is. For what he does.\" Gustin shrugged. \"But he's not a wizard, right? Can't cast Fireball. Can't manipulate Mana. He's developed within his limitations. That's admirable. But it's still limitation.\"\n\nI thought about Ricardo's practice blade coming at me in the training yard. The way he moved—fast enough that my Terra Form was the only thing giving me a chance. The fact that he'd been teaching me for five years, and I still couldn't beat him.\n\nThe fact that his \"limitations\" had made him more dangerous than most people I'd seen.\n\n\"You're quiet,\" Gustin observed.\n\n\"Just thinking.\"\n\n\"About?\"\n\nI set down my fork, the weight of the realization settling in my chest like a stone.\n\nAbout how the apprentice had looked at Kerrick the way academy administrators looked at my Mi score. The same dismissive assessment. The same certainty that numbers—forty-five Mi, Qi enhancement instead of Mana manipulation—meant someone wasn't worth serious consideration.\n\nYou're making a virtue of limitation, the apprentice had said.\n\nForty-five Mi is technically the threshold, the academy administrator in Mercari had told my father, but practically speaking, students below fifty struggle to keep pace. We recommend he pursue other opportunities.\n\nDifferent words. Same message. You're not good enough for what you want to be.\n\nI'd been so angry at those administrators. And now here I was, listening to Gustin—my friend, someone I genuinely liked—say that Ricardo's Qi development was admirable but still limitation.\n\nMy hands clenched under the table.\n\nRicardo, who could move faster than my eyes could follow. Who'd spent five years teaching me technique I'd thought was pointless. Who'd known I was integrating Terra Form into his kata and never said a word about it, just kept drilling the forms until they were perfect.\n\nEvery movement should have purpose, he'd said. No wasted motion.\n\nWhat if he'd seen what I was too stubborn to notice—that someone with forty-five Mi wasn't going to succeed by trying to be a conventional mage? That I needed something different, something hybrid, something that drew on both physical discipline and magical theory?\n\nWhat if those five years I'd spent resenting his \"practical\" training were actually him preparing me for the path I'd chosen?\n\nThe thought sat uncomfortably in my chest. And underneath it, something worse: I was sitting here with stolen coins and no acceptance letter, betting everything that I could prove I belonged in the wizard category. The superior category, if I believed the apprentice. The category that looked down on Guardians as affordable labor, on Qi users as people who'd accepted their limitations.\n\nMy throat felt tight.\n\nI wanted to be a wizard desperately enough to leave my family, steal from my father, abandon everything I'd known. But what did that make me? Someone fighting against unfair dismissal? Or someone so desperate to be part of the group that dismissed people like Ricardo—like me—that I was willing to become exactly what I hated?\n\nIf I made it to Mali and somehow survived, would I look at the next desperate kid with barely-qualifying numbers and see someone worth teaching? Or would I become the kind of mage who forgot that Ricardo's \"limitations\" made him more dangerous than half the certified wizards in Mercari?\n\nWould I forget where I came from?\n\nThe guilt twisted deeper. Not just for stealing the coins or leaving my father. But for wanting so badly to belong to the group that didn't think people like me—people like Kerrick, people like Ricardo—belonged at all.\n\nI forced myself to breathe slowly. The tavern felt too warm, too loud.\n\nHe's developed within his limitations, Gustin had said about Ricardo. That's admirable. But it's still limitation.\n\nAnd I'd nodded. Hadn't defended the man who'd spent five years training me. Because part of me agreed. Part of me thought magic was superior, that if I could just prove I had what it took, I'd be better than the people who developed Qi instead.\n\nMy jaw ached. I'd been clenching it without realizing.\n\nThat made me just as bad as the smug apprentice. Maybe worse, because I knew what it felt like to be dismissed. And I was still trying to join the people who did the dismissing.\n\n\"Nothing important,\" I said finally, the words feeling hollow. \"Just... that got uglier than it needed to.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Gustin pushed his empty plate aside. The tavern noise had returned to normal—dice rolling at a corner table, someone laughing near the bar. \"So. Explain the speed thing with Terra Form again. You said less than a second?\"\n\n\"Roughly half a second, maybe a bit faster.\" I leaned back, the chair creaking. \"There's still a fraction between intention and effect. But in combat, it feels nearly instant—fast enough that I don't think about casting anymore, just about moving.\"\n\nGustin leaned back, thoughtful. \"See, that's what I don't understand. Practice improves control—range, precision, power efficiency. But not speed, not really.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because the array structure is fixed.\" He picked up his cup, realized it was empty, set it down. \"Ignite's been optimized for centuries—I've been casting it for three years, and it still takes two seconds. Same as the theoretical minimum.\"\n\n\"Maybe Terra Form is just simpler?\"\n\n\"It's not.\" Gustin shook his head. \"Terra Form has six to eight rune modifications depending on complexity. Ignite only has three. Terra Form should be slower, not faster.\"\n\nA serving girl passed our table, collecting empty plates. Gustin waited until she moved on.\n\n\"But you said you practice while doing sword forms?\"\n\n\"Ricardo made me. Thought I was wasting time on magic, wanted me focused on fighting.\"\n\n\"But what if he was onto something?\" Gustin's eyes lit up with that look people get when they're chasing an idea. \"What if the movement helps somehow?\"\n\nI frowned. \"How?\"\n\n\"Like—okay, hear me out—\" He leaned forward, hands gesturing. \"Your body learns to cast while moving, so maybe the spell becomes part of the motion? Instead of something you stop to do?\"\n\nI'd never thought about it that way. \"Traditional mages stand still when they cast.\"\n\n\"Exactly. They can move, but they don't.\" Gustin nodded. \"Movement makes mistakes more likely. And mistakes...\" He grimaced. \"With utility spells, you just fizzle. With combat spells, you explode.\"\n\n\"Comforting.\"\n\n\"So everyone learns to stand still for precision. But you don't.\" He grinned. \"Half a second is way faster than the three to five seconds most texts describe for Terra Form. Even faster than my Ignite.\"\n\n\"So you think I found an optimization?\"\n\n\"If you've gotten it down to half a second...\" He shook his head. \"That's actually brilliant. Probably only works for simple spells integrated into physical movement, but for something like Terra Form in combat? That's a real advantage.\"\n\n\"An advantage that still only gets me one spell.\"\n\n\"One spell with an eighty percent reduction in cast time.\" Gustin's expression turned serious. \"Marcus, mages have built entire careers on optimizations like that. If you can teach it to others, document the technique...\" He paused. \"That's the kind of discovery that gets you noticed. Maybe even published.\"\n\nI thought about that. Published. Noticed. All things that required being inside the system I was trying to break into.\n\n\"First I have to get to Mali,\" I said.\n\n\"Right.\" He stood, swaying slightly from the ale. \"Come on. We should sleep. Tomorrow's another day of watching Loren argue with every village elder between here and Portare.\"\n\nWe made our way upstairs. Separate rooms—small luxury, but worth it for the privacy.\n\nI lay in the narrow bed, listening to the city outside. Lorisfort. I'd been to Fluminis before with my father, but always under his watch, staying in merchant quarters he'd arranged. This was different. First night sleeping somewhere entirely on my own terms, in a city my father wouldn't find me.\n\nMy pack sat beside the bed, Isabella's letter tucked inside my father's leather satchel. Tomorrow we'd keep moving. Four more days to Portare, then I'd use that letter, meet her aunt, figure out the next step.\n\nOne day at a time.\n\nOne step closer to Mali.\n\nI fell asleep thinking about earth rising beneath my feet, and whether movement really did make magic faster, and what it would mean if Gustin was right.\n\n~~~\n\nThe days after Lorisfort fell into the same rhythm we'd established since leaving Conducere. Wake at dawn, run through Ricardo's kata while the others packed camp. Ride north with Gustin talking about magical theory and his village in Planus. Practice sword forms in the evening while the guards set up the perimeter. Camp under stars. Repeat.\n\nMy legs ached from days in the saddle. Thunderhoof handled it better than I did—steady as always while I shifted position every hour trying to find comfort that didn't exist. The sun turned my neck red and my lips cracked despite drinking from the water skins.\n\nTwice the guards spotted what they suspected were bandits—distant figures watching from tree lines—but they never attacked. Six wagons with a dozen armed guards was too much trouble for easy pickings.\n\nOn the second day out from Lorisfort, we stopped at a village around noon for water and supplies. The village elder insisted on inspecting every wagon for contraband, poking through grain sacks and asking questions about destinations. He found nothing but wasted an hour of daylight anyway.\n\nWhile the inspection dragged on, a blacksmith's daughter sold us meat pies from a basket, her hands permanently stained with soot. Gustin bought two. I bought three—one for later. A one-eyed innkeeper tried charging double for baths. \"Because I can,\" he said with a gap-toothed grin. We didn't pay. Loren got the caravan moving before anyone could waste more coin on the luxury of hot water.\n\nGustin and I fell into easy companionship. We argued about whether Mi values could be improved through training (he said no, I said maybe, neither of us knew for certain).\n\n~~~\n\nOn the third day out from Lorisfort, Gustin asked about my family.\n\nWe were riding side by side, the morning sun warm on our backs, when he said, \"You never talk about them. Your father—he's a merchant, right? Warehouses in Conducere?\"\n\nI kept my eyes on the road ahead. \"Four warehouses. Import goods from across Rivus.\"\n\n\"Successful, then.\"\n\n\"Very.\"\n\nSilence stretched between us. Gustin shifted in his saddle. \"And your mother?\"\n\n\"Died when I was seven.\" The words came out flat, automatic. I'd said them so many times they'd lost their weight.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" He meant it—I could hear it in his voice. \"Was she... did she have magic? Is that where your Terra Form comes from?\"\n\n\"She taught me the array. Showed me how to shape earth.\" I watched Thunderhoof's ears flick forward and back. \"She was the one who believed I could be a mage. Taught me when I was seven, a few months before she died. Everyone just... assumed I'd be fine. That if I could cast that young, I'd have enough Mi to make it work.\" I paused. \"Then I got tested three months ago. Forty-five. Right at the threshold. The academies in Mercari weren't interested.\"\n\n\"And your father doesn't believe that.\"\n\nIt wasn't a question. I didn't answer it anyway.\n\n\"Marcus—\"\n\n\"He's practical,\" I said, cutting him off before he could dig deeper. \"He builds things. Manages people. Plans for the future. And in his plans, I inherit the business, marry well, produce heirs, and carry on the family legacy his father built from nothing.\" I heard the bitterness in my own voice and tried to soften it. \"He's not wrong to want that. It's a good life. Secure. Useful.\"\n\n\"But not what you want.\"\n\n\"No.\" I looked at him finally. \"Not what I want.\"\n\nGustin was quiet for a moment, studying me with that analytical expression he got when he was working through a problem. \"Chief Aldric—my surrogate father who adopted me after my parents died—threw himself into helping me when Old man Corvin said I should apply to Academia Midur.\"\n\n\"Old man Corvin?\"\n\n\"My teacher. Retired mage, settled in Arvum.\" Gustin shifted in his saddle. \"The village needs capable people, and sending me to Mali meant the whole community had to pool resources.\"\n\nI thought about my father's wealth. The coins I'd stolen. \"That's a lot of pressure.\"\n\nHe smiled slightly. \"Chief Aldric spent a week running the numbers, weighing the village's needs against my potential. But he graduated from Academia Midur himself—studied there before he came back to lead Arvum.\"\n\n\"So he understood what it would take?\"\n\n\"More than anyone.\" Gustin's expression softened. \"Once he committed, he did everything. Helped me crystallize my Mana before I left.\"\n\n\"Before you left? That's early.\"\n\n\"Yeah. And he wrote this incredibly detailed letter to the Academy documenting every spell I'd mastered. That's what got me the conditional acceptance.\"\n\n\"That's... that's really good of him.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Gustin looked away. The road stretched ahead, empty except for a distant merchant cart. \"Makes the pressure worse, though. He sacrificed a lot to give me this chance. The whole village did.\"\n\n\"What do they expect?\"\n\n\"Someone from Arvum becoming a certified mage?\" He shrugged. \"That's status. Connections. Maybe magical support when crops fail or Beasts threaten the livestock. So he understands why I'm going. But the weight of all those expectations...\" He trailed off.\n\n\"My father understands why I'm going,\" I said. \"He just thinks I'm making a mistake. That I'm throwing away certainty for a dream that'll break me.\"\n\n\"And maybe he's right.\"\n\nI looked at him sharply.\n\n\"Not about the dream being wrong,\" Gustin said quickly. \"But about it breaking you. Mali's not going to be easy, Marcus. Forty-five Mi, no acceptance letter, no connections inside the academy...\" He met my eyes. \"It could break you. Or make you into something your father never imagined.\"\n\nThe words sat between us for a long moment.\n\n\"I guess we'll find out,\" I said finally.\n\nWe rode in silence after that, but it was a different kind of silence. Comfortable. Like something had been acknowledged that didn't need further discussion.\n\n~~~\n\nOn the fourth and final day out from Lorisfort, we stopped for the midday meal at a clearing where other travelers had clearly rested before—fire pit ringed with smoke-blackened stones, logs worn smooth from countless bodies, space for the horses to graze on new-green grass.\n\nI finished eating before the others and found myself moving through Ricardo's training forms without thinking about it. The first sequence—low guard to high, weight shifting, imagining an opponent's strike. I'd been running through them every morning and evening when the caravan stopped—muscle memory demanding the practice even without Ricardo there to correct my stance. Most of the travelers ignored me. The guards occasionally watched with professional interest, but nobody had asked about it yet.\n\n\"You do that a lot.\"\n\nI turned. Gustin was watching from where he sat on one of the logs, his own meal finished.\n\n\"Old habit,\" I said. \"Ricardo—my sword instructor—drilled these into me for five years.\"\n\n\"The same Ricardo who thought you were wasting time on magic?\"\n\nI nodded, returning to the form. Low guard. High strike. Step and turn. \"For years he wanted me focused on something practical. Then after I got tested three months ago and the academies rejected me, he said maybe magic wasn't the path for someone at the Om Point. That I should consider Qi development instead.\"\n\n\"But you practiced anyway.\"\n\n\"Had to do both.\" I moved through the next sequence, feeling the familiar burn in my shoulders. \"Sword forms in the morning, magic practice at night. Ricardo didn't like it, but he couldn't stop me from casting on my own time.\"\n\nGustin stood and walked closer, watching my movements with that same analytical expression. \"You're doing it now.\"\n\n\"Doing what?\"\n\n\"Casting. Or preparing to cast.\" He gestured at my feet. \"Your weight distribution—that's not just sword work. You're setting up for Terra Form.\"\n\nI stopped mid-movement. Looked down at my stance. He was right. I hadn't even realized I was doing it—my body had started shifting into the stance I used when I wanted to raise earth quickly.\n\n\"Huh.\"\n\n\"It's integrated,\" Gustin said slowly, like he was working through the idea as he spoke. \"The sword forms and the spell. You don't separate them in your mind anymore, do you?\"\n\n\"I... no. I guess I don't.\" I thought about it, wiping sweat from my forehead. The sun was getting high. \"Ricardo always said every movement should have purpose. No wasted motion.\"\n\n\"Smart.\"\n\n\"When I started practicing Terra Form during the forms, it felt wrong at first—like I was doing both things badly. But after a few months...\" I shrugged. \"It started feeling natural. Like the movement and the magic were part of the same thing.\"\n\n\"That's why it's so fast.\" Gustin's eyes were bright with excitement now. \"You're not stopping to cast.\"\n\n\"I'm not?\"\n\n\"No—you're casting while you move, and your body already knows the motion so well that there's no hesitation, no second-guessing.\" He was pacing now, working through it. \"The spell becomes part of the physical technique.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" I wiped sweat from my forehead. \"Ricardo never talked about it like that. He just kept drilling the forms until I could do them in my sleep.\"\n\n\"Did he know? That you were practicing magic during his training?\"\n\n\"Probably. Ricardo notices everything.\" I smiled slightly, remembering that ridiculous mustache bouncing as he corrected my stance for the thousandth time. \"He never said anything about it, though. Just kept making me repeat the sequences until they were perfect.\"\n\nGustin sat back down on the log. Behind him, I could see Loren talking to one of the other wagon drivers. We'd be moving soon.\n\n\"Five years of integrated practice,\" Gustin said. \"No wonder your casting speed breaks the normal patterns.\"\n\n\"You think it's that simple?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"This is the kind of thing that could actually be studied. Written up.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"If you could teach it to others...\"\n\n\"First I have to survive Mali,\" I said, cutting him off. \"Then maybe we can worry about whether anyone wants to learn from someone with forty-five Mi.\"\n\n\"They will.\" Gustin's voice had surprising certainty. \"If you can prove it works—really works, not just for you but as a teachable technique—they'll want to learn.\"\n\n\"Even the ones who think people like me are beneath them?\"\n\nHe grinned. \"Especially them. Nothing gets a mage's attention like someone doing something they think is impossible.\"\n\nI wanted to believe him. Wanted to think that my years of resentful sword practice and stubborn magic training had added up to something valuable.\n\nBut standing there in a dusty clearing on the road to Portare, still weeks away from Mali and months away from proving anything, I couldn't quite let myself hope that far ahead.\n\n\"Come on,\" I said instead. \"Loren's packing up. We should get moving.\"\n\nBut as I climbed back into Thunderhoof's saddle, I caught myself smiling.\n\nMaybe Gustin was right. Maybe this thing I'd stumbled into—this weird fusion of Ricardo's training and my mother's magic—was something worth studying.\n\nMaybe it was something that could matter.\n\nAfter the meal, we climbed back into our saddles and continued north. By afternoon, the land started to change.\n\n\"Smell that?\" Gustin asked.\n\nSalt. The ocean. We'd been climbing gradual hills for hours, and now at the crest, I could see it.\n\nThunderhoof's ears swiveled forward, nostrils flaring at the unfamiliar scent. He shifted beneath me, uneasy with something he'd never encountered.\n\nPortare.\n\nThe city sprawled along the coast like something out of a painting. Buildings stacked against hillsides, the harbor below packed with ships of every size. Masts like a forest of wood and canvas. The ocean beyond stretching to the horizon, blue and vast.\n\nI'd never seen the ocean before. Neither had Thunderhoof.\n\nRicardo had described it once, comparing sword stance to the way sailors balanced on ships. But nothing prepared me for the scale. The way it just... ended at the sky, a line so distant the horizon seemed more concept than place. The smell of salt mixed with fish and tar and something else I couldn't name—something alive and old and vast.\n\n\"Big, isn't it?\" Gustin said quietly.\n\nMy chest felt tight. \"Yeah.\"\n\nThe caravan descended toward the city gates. Larger than Lorisfort. Larger than Conducere, even—grown wild from centuries of unplanned trade, every merchant nation on Rivus sending ships here, the city expanding in layers like a shell built by uncountable hands. Bahia's capital port, gateway to the world, where ships left daily for every coast and continent.\n\nSomewhere down there was Isabella's aunt. A room. Connections.\n\nAnd a ship that would take me across that impossible blue expanse to Regalis.\n\nThe guards at Portare's gates waved the caravan through with barely a glance. Inside, the city swallowed us—sounds and smells and people from every race and nation. Thunderhoof's steps became more careful, picking through the crowded streets with the caution of a horse unused to cities this size. The salt air thickened with humanity: unwashed bodies, spiced cooking from a dozen cultures, rotting fish guts in the gutters, perfume from passing merchants, and underneath it all the constant smell of tar from the shipyards. Humans, yes, but also Dwarves with their elaborate beards, a few Bandar merchants chattering in that rapid way they had, even a Naga near the waterfront coiled on a platform built for their serpentine bodies.\n\n\"This is it,\" Loren called out as the caravan reached a large square. \"End of the line for those going to Portare. Anyone continuing north to Varesh in Vallis, we depart day after tomorrow. Same spot, dawn.\"\n\nPassengers began disembarking. Merchants checking their goods. Travelers heading off in different directions.\n\nI slid off Thunderhoof's saddle, legs stiff and protesting after seven days of riding. The cobblestones felt strange under my feet after so long in the saddle—solid, unmoving, final.\n\nThis was it. The edge of everything I'd known. Beyond this city lay an ocean I'd never crossed, a nation I'd never been, and an academy that had no idea I was coming.\n\nGustin dismounted beside me, looking around with the same mixture of awe and uncertainty I felt. \"Well,\" he said. \"Here we are.\"\n\n\"Here we are,\" I echoed.\n\nThe city sprawled in every direction—ships and warehouses and people from a dozen nations all moving with purpose I couldn't fathom. Somewhere in this chaos was Isabella's aunt. A room. Connections that might lead to passage across that impossible expanse of water.\n\nAnd somehow, between here and Mali, I had to figure out how to become the person who deserved to be there.\n\n\"Good luck,\" Gustin said, shouldering his pack. \"Maybe I'll see you at Academia Midur. If we both make it.\"\n\nI watched him start to turn away, then heard myself say: \"Wait.\"\n\nHe looked back.\n\nThe words came before I'd fully formed the thought. But standing here at the edge of the known world, watching the only person who'd shown genuine interest in my theories about to walk away—I couldn't let that happen. Not when I had so much to learn and so little time to learn it.\n\n\"I have a proposition,\" I said.",

            "content_text": "Chapter 3 - Portare\n\nWe moved away from the caravan square toward a quieter side street. The market chaos faded to background noise—merchants shouting prices, horses being led to stables, the distant cries of gulls circling the harbor.\n\nI needed to say this right. Gustin had been generous with his time and knowledge during the journey. I couldn't just assume he'd agree to more.\n\n\"A proposition,\" I said, meeting his eyes. \"About passage to Regalis.\"\n\nGustin raised an eyebrow. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Ship passage to Regalis won't be cheap,\" I said. The words came faster now, like I was trying to convince myself as much as him. \"I've got coin. You've got knowledge I need.\"\n\nHe tilted his head, curious. \"What kind of knowledge?\"\n\n\"Spell arrays. Two of them—something fundamental.\" I shifted my pack higher on my shoulder. \"Teach me the theory during the voyage, and I'll pay for your passage to Regalis.\"\n\nGustin stared at me. For a long moment, the only sound was the bustle around us—merchants haggling, horses being led away, the distant cry of gulls.\n\n\"Marcus,\" he said finally. \"You know that knowing an array won't let you cast the spell, right? You still need the Mi capacity, a crystallized Mana core—\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"—and even if you had enough Mana, you'd need years of practice to stabilize the array properly, and that's assuming you don't—\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said again. \"But after what you said about movement and casting speed...\" I met his eyes. \"Maybe I can't use conventional spells now. But I want to understand how they work. The structure. The theory. How the runes interact.\"\n\n\"Why?\" He wasn't being dismissive—genuinely curious. \"If you can't cast them, what's the point?\"\n\nI thought about Ricardo's training. Five years of sword forms I'd resented because they weren't magic. Five years that had somehow made my Terra Form faster than any academy text said was possible. Five years of learning things I didn't understand the value of until much later.\n\n\"Because I don't know what I'll need to know,\" I said. \"And maybe understanding how standard spells work will help me figure out... something else. Something that works for someone like me.\"\n\nGustin was quiet, studying me with that same analytical look he got when we discussed magical theory. \"You're serious about this. About finding a way forward even without traditional training.\"\n\n\"I'm going to Mali either way. With or without an acceptance letter. With or without enough Mi to satisfy their standards.\" I heard the stubbornness in my own voice. \"I'd rather go knowing more than I do now.\"\n\n\"Ship passage to Regalis...\" He rubbed his jaw, calculating. \"Decent berths run twenty, maybe thirty gold per person. You sure you can manage that?\"\n\n\"I only promised to pay for your passage,\" I said. \"Who said it has to be decent?\"\n\nThat got a laugh. \"Fair point.\" He considered for a moment. \"Learning arrays you can't cast yet. That's either brilliant or insane. Maybe both.\"\n\n\"Knowledge is never useless.\" I meant it. \"And I think you're curious enough to see where this goes. You said it yourself—my Terra Form speed doesn't match the theoretical models. What if there are other rules that don't work the way the academies think they do?\"\n\nGustin's eyes lit up with that look people get when they're chasing an idea. \"You think this is something you could teach someone else? Not just something that works for you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe.\" I shrugged. \"But I won't figure it out by pretending I don't need help. You know things I don't. I can pay for that knowledge. And honestly?\" I smiled slightly. \"I'd rather spend the voyage learning something useful than staring at water and panicking about what happens when we dock.\"\n\nHe studied me for a long moment. Then a slow grin spread across his face. \"Ignite and Barrier.\"\n\n\"Two spells?\"\n\n\"Two completely different foundational approaches.\" His enthusiasm was building now. \"Heat generation versus force shaping. Between them, you'll understand how spell construction actually works—how to read runic arrays, why elements interact the way they do.\"\n\n\"That's... more than I expected.\"\n\n\"Well, if I'm going to teach you, I'm going to do it properly.\" He extended his hand. \"Deal. I teach you spell theory, you get me to Regalis. We'll find the cheapest passage we can and make do.\"\n\nWe shook on it. His grip was firm, his smile genuine.\n\n\"So I'm paying for ship passage to learn spells I can't actually use,\" I said. \"My father would be proud of my business sense.\"\n\nGustin laughed. \"Look at it this way—you'll have the theory down perfectly before you can embarrass yourself trying to cast them.\"\n\n\"That's... actually not comforting.\"\n\nHe smiled, but the expression faded quickly. We both knew what was at stake.\n\n\"One more thing,\" I said. \"My contact here—Isabella's aunt, she runs a boarding house. Might know about ship captains, reliable passage. Instead of both of us hunting separately for lodging and information...\" I hesitated. \"Want to come with me? Meet her?\"\n\n\"You barely know me.\"\n\n\"I know you spent three days explaining magical theory to someone with forty-five Mi. I know you think I might have found an actual optimization instead of just dismissing it as luck.\" I shifted my pack. \"That's more than I know about most people.\"\n\nGustin considered this, then nodded. \"Alright. Let's meet your contact. What's her name?\"\n\n\"Maria. Maria Castelli. Runs a place called Tidewatch.\"\n\n\"Tidewatch.\" He grinned. \"At least it sounds maritime. That's got to be a good sign.\"\n\nWe gathered our things and headed into Portare proper, leading our mounts through streets that smelled of salt and fish and possibility.\n\n~~~\n\nFinding Tidewatch took longer than I'd expected.\n\nIsabella's letter had mentioned the boarding house was \"near the harbor, three streets up from Merchant's Row,\" but Portare had at least five different areas that could qualify as \"near the harbor.\"\n\n\"Try asking someone?\" Gustin suggested after we'd wandered the third wrong street.\n\nA fishmonger with ink-stained fingers pointed us in the right direction. \"Tidewatch? Maria's place? Aye, maritime quarter, that way. Look for the lighthouse on the sign—can't miss it.\"\n\nWe found it twenty minutes later—a three-story building with whitewashed walls and blue shutters, a painted sign showing a stylized lighthouse hanging above the door. Clean. Well-maintained. The kind of place that charged fair rates and didn't ask too many questions.\n\nWe tied our mounts to the post outside—Thunderhoof and Gustin's sturdy pony side by side. I pulled Isabella's letter from my pack. The paper was worn from a week of travel, the ink slightly smudged but still legible.\n\n\"Ready?\" I asked.\n\nGustin adjusted his pack. \"Lead the way.\"\n\nInside, the common room was busy with late afternoon activity. A merchant sat in the corner reviewing shipping manifests. Two sailors played cards at a table near the window. An older woman was knitting by the fireplace, occasionally glancing at the harbor view. The smell of cooking fish drifted from what I assumed was the kitchen.\n\nBehind the front desk, a woman checked her ledger while simultaneously directing her assistant with hand gestures toward a table that needed clearing—the same multitasking efficiency my father used when managing three conversations at once. She looked up as we entered, and I recognized the sharp assessment immediately. Merchant stock, like Isabella had said. Perhaps a decade older than my father, with the same practical bearing that came from running a business where every decision mattered.\n\n\"Can I help you?\"\n\nI stepped forward. \"We're looking for Maria Castelli? Isabella sent me—said her aunt runs this boarding house?\"\n\n\"I'm Maria.\" She held out her hand for the letter I was clearly holding, the gesture so matter-of-fact it would've been rude to refuse. \"Let me see it.\"\n\nI handed it over. She unfolded it and read, her eyes moving across the words with the same geometric precision my father used reviewing ledgers. Then her expression softened—just slightly, but enough to notice. \"Isabella's friend.\" She looked me over, not unkindly. \"She says you're heading to Mali to test for Academia Midur. That you'll need help with lodging and ship passage.\" Her eyes shifted to Gustin. \"Both of you testing?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" Gustin said. \"I'm Gustin Green. From a village near Voskavall. I have my acceptance letter if you need to—\"\n\n\"No need.\" She waved a hand, setting Isabella's letter aside. \"Any friend of Isabella's is welcome here. She speaks highly of you, Marcus—says you're dedicated and determined. Also mentions your father wanted you in the family business instead of letting you pursue magic.\" She smiled knowingly. \"Family matters—I understand. Sometimes parents have trouble letting their children pursue their own paths.\"\n\nI nodded, throat tight. \"Thank you for understanding.\"\n\n\"Do you have two rooms available?\" Gustin asked. \"We can pay separately.\"\n\n\"Second floor. Third and fourth doors on the right. Two silver a night per room, three meals included. No guests after sunset, no noise after tenth bell.\" She gestured toward the stairs. \"Stable's around back for your mounts. Tell the hand I sent you.\"\n\nWe found the stable around back. A young stable hand looked up from mucking a stall.\n\n\"Maria sent us,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded, wiping his hands. \"Fresh arrivals? I'll get 'em settled.\" He took Thunderhoof's reins, then Gustin's pony, leading them to empty stalls. The stable was clean, well-organized. Thunderhoof seemed relieved to be out of the city chaos, and the pony immediately found the water trough.\n\n\"Your horse has a name?\" Gustin asked as we headed back inside.\n\n\"Thunderhoof. One of our household staff has a young son—Matthew. He named it when he was learning to talk. The name stuck.\"\n\n\"Mine doesn't. The village just calls it 'the pony.'\" He smiled ruefully. \"It belonged to Old man Corvin before he gave it to me for the journey. Said I'd need it more than he would.\"\n\nWe claimed our rooms—small but clean, each with a bed, desk, washbasin, and window overlooking the harbor. I could hear Gustin moving around in the room next to mine, unpacking, settling in.\n\nI sat on the bed and pulled out my father's satchel. The leather was already showing signs of use—scuffs from a week of travel, the compartments well-organized with coins, letters, and small necessities. I had to force myself to look at the contents.\n\nSeventy-nine gold, four silver remaining. I'd started with eighty after paying the caravan master. The Lorisfort inn and meals had cost six silver.\n\nShip passage would be expensive. And I had no idea what Regalis prices would be like, or Mali lodging, or how long my coin would really last.\n\nI sat there for a moment, staring at the closed satchel, listening to Gustin moving around in the room next door. We were here. Actually in Portare. Tomorrow we'd need to find a ship, figure out pricing, make decisions that would determine whether we even made it to Mali.\n\nI stood and knocked on Gustin's door. \"Want to ask Maria about the docks before we settle in? Get an idea what we're dealing with?\"\n\n\"Good thinking,\" he called back. A moment later his door opened. \"Better to know tonight than waste tomorrow wandering blind.\"\n\n~~~\n\nWe headed back downstairs and found Maria in the common room overseeing the dinner preparations. The evening crowd was starting to gather—a few early diners, boarders claiming their usual tables. The smell of cooking fish was stronger now, mixing with fresh bread.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said. \"We need to find ships to Regalis tomorrow. Where should we look?\"\n\nShe wiped her hands on her apron without looking up from directing her assistant. \"Merchant's Row, southern harbor. Look for the Regalis flags—gold tree on green field.\" She made a note in her ledger, then met my eyes. \"Come find me before you book. I can tell you which captains to avoid.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\nShe studied us both. \"Isabella says in her letter that you're determined. That quality will serve you well at the academies.\" Her expression was genuinely kind. \"At the docks, too.\"\n\nMy throat went tight. \"I'll do my best.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you will. Both of you.\" She gestured toward the stairs. \"Dinner's in an hour. Get some rest. You both look exhausted from the road. Tomorrow you can tackle the docks with clear heads.\"\n\nI counted out four silver coins for my room. Gustin paid his own. She tucked the coins into her ledger without comment.\n\nWe headed upstairs. Gustin paused at his door. \"She seems kind.\"\n\n\"Isabella's family.\" I shifted my pack. \"Merchant stock. They know how to read people and situations.\"\n\n\"Think she suspects you don't have an acceptance letter?\"\n\nI'd been trying not to think about that. \"Probably. But she's helping anyway. That's what matters.\" I shifted my pack higher. \"Besides, at this point I'm collecting favors from people who think I'm going to fail. It's almost a skill.\"\n\nHe laughed quietly. \"At least you're realistic about it.\"\n\n\"I'm realistic about everything except the part where I keep going anyway.\"\n\nHe nodded and closed his door. I heard him settle in for the evening.\n\nI did the same, trying not to think about tomorrow, or the sea voyage ahead, or how much coin I was about to spend on something that might end in rejection anyway.\n\nThat evening, the common room was packed for dinner. Maria and a younger woman I assumed was her assistant moved between tables, serving fish stew from a massive pot. The smell was incredible—garlic, herbs, fresh bread on the side.\n\nGustin and I found seats at a table near the back. The stew tasted better than anything we'd had on the road. Around us, the boarding house buzzed with conversation. Dock workers arguing about tomorrow's loading schedule. A merchant couple discussing prices for Vallis wool. The two sailors from earlier still playing cards, now with coin on the table. A family with three children trying to keep the youngest from spilling his bowl.\n\n\"Tomorrow we find a ship,\" Gustin said quietly. \"And deal with the horses.\"\n\n\"Never been on a ship before,\" I admitted. \"No idea what to even ask for.\"\n\n\"Me neither.\" He looked around the common room. \"Should we ask someone?\"\n\nI glanced at the sailors playing cards nearby—the older one had weathered hands and a scar across his cheek, the younger one lean and sun-darkened. Both looked like they'd spent years at sea.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said. \"We need to book passage to Regalis. Any advice on finding a good ship?\"\n\nThe older one set down his cards, looking us over. \"First voyage?\"\n\n\"Does it show?\"\n\n\"You both got that landlubber stink.\" He jerked his head toward the empty chairs. \"Sit down. Where you headed, then?\"\n\n\"Regalis. Academia Midur.\"\n\n\"Navale's the port,\" the older sailor said. He took a drink. \"From there ya catch river barges up to Mali.\"\n\n\"How long does the voyage take?\" Gustin asked.\n\n\"Two weeks with fair winds,\" the younger sailor cut in. \"Three if weather turns nasty.\"\n\n\"Four if it really hates ya,\" the older one added. He studied us. \"Academy folk? Smart bookin' early. Ships fill fast this time o' year.\"\n\n\"We need space to study,\" I said. \"Spell theory. What would you recommend?\"\n\nThe younger sailor snorted. \"Hammocks, they're stuffed with dock workers who snore like—\"\n\n\"Then ya want a cabin, not hammock space,\" the older one talked over him. He gestured with his mug. \"Hammocks run five to eight gold a head—cheap, but you're crushed in with thirty other bastards, someone always snorin', stinks to hell.\"\n\n\"And cabins?\"\n\n\"Shared cabins with two berths run twenty-five to thirty gold per person,\" the younger sailor said. \"Singles are forty-five to sixty per person.\"\n\nThe older one took a drink. \"Expensive. But ya get privacy, can study without some drunk pissin' on your books.\"\n\nIf you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\n\n\"Most ships only got a few cabins,\" the younger sailor added. \"Sell out quick. If ya can't afford berths, hammocks'll get ya there.\"\n\n\"Which ships would you trust?\" Gustin asked.\n\n\"Dawnbreaker.\" Both sailors said it at the same time, then the older one continued. \"Captain Ross don't tolerate slack.\"\n\n\"Seafire's decent too,\" the younger one said. \"But Ross is better.\"\n\n\"Skip the Eastern Promise,\" the older sailor warned. \"Cheap means cheap, if ya know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Where do we find them?\"\n\n\"Merchant's Row come morning.\" The older sailor picked up his cards. \"Captains'll be there loaded down with cargo.\"\n\nThe younger one grinned. \"Good luck with the Academy. You'll be needin' it.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\nHe waved it off and returned to his game.\n\nWe finished our meal and headed upstairs. Through my window, I could see ships in the harbor, their masts like a forest against the darkening sky.\n\nTomorrow. Tomorrow we'd figure out which ship would take us across that impossible expanse of water.\n\n~~~\n\nThe next morning, we left our heavier gear in our rooms and headed out. My claymore would draw too many stares—better to travel light with just our coin purses.\n\nWe'd asked Maria at breakfast about livestock traders, and she'd directed us to the merchant quarter where traders dealt in everything from donkeys to warhorses. The man we found had a weathered face and calculating eyes—someone who'd made a living off other people's necessities.\n\nHe examined Thunderhoof first, walking around him, checking his teeth, running hands down his legs. \"Port horse. Good breeding, but too old for racing, not built for hauling. I'll give ya six gold.\"\n\n\"Six?\" I stared at him. \"He's worth at least fifteen.\"\n\n\"Port's choking with horses. Supply and demand, kid.\"\n\n\"What about taking him on the ship?\"\n\nThe trader snorted. \"Ship transport? You're lookin' at twenty, thirty gold easy. Horse is worth maybe half that. Plus they get sick as hell on the water—most don't make it.\" He shrugged. \"Most folk sell cheap or send 'em home with the caravans. Six gold. That's the offer.\"\n\nThunderhoof turned his head and looked at me with dark, patient eyes. The same way he'd stood every morning while Matthew groomed him—the seven-year-old trying so hard to help his father Kyle do everything perfect.\n\n\"I'll leave it,\" I said.\n\nThe trader moved to Gustin's pony next, giving it the same assessment. \"Four gold. Decent work animal but nothing special.\"\n\n\"Four gold,\" Gustin repeated slowly. He looked at his pony—the mount Old man Corvin had given him, the horse that had carried him all the way from his village through Conducere to here.\n\n\"I'll take it,\" he said quietly.\n\nThe trader counted out four gold coins. Gustin pocketed them, gave the pony one final pat, and stepped back.\n\nI watched the trader lead the pony away. Gustin stood very still, not looking at me.\n\n\"The village needs the coin,\" he said finally. \"Can't afford sentiment. That's the difference between us, I think. You have the luxury of choice. I don't.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. He was right.\n\nWe walked back toward the Tidewatch in silence. After a few streets, Gustin spoke again.\n\n\"What about yours? Thunderhoof.\" He glanced at me. \"Six gold is six gold.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Six gold from my father's satchel. Eight to send Thunderhoof home to a boy who'd named him and loved him. The math was insane—Gustin sold his pony because he had no choice. I was spending stolen coin to preserve a connection to a home I'd run from.\n\n\"But Matthew...\" I trailed off.\n\n\"The kid who named him.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I looked at Thunderhoof tied to the post. \"I don't have to make this choice. That's the difference.\"\n\nWe walked the rest of the way without speaking. But it was a different kind of silence now—not awkward, just two people trying to figure out impossible decisions.\n\nWe found Maria back at the Tidewatch. She was reviewing her ledger, but looked up when we entered. Her eyes flicked toward the window where Thunderhoof was still visible, tied to the post outside.\n\n\"Only one horse out there now,\" she observed. \"Sold the other one?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Gustin said quietly. \"Four gold.\"\n\n\"And yours?\" She looked at me.\n\n\"The trader offered six. I couldn't.\" The words felt inadequate. \"But I can't take him on a ship either.\"\n\nShe considered that. \"There's a merchant caravan heading back to Mercari in three days. I could arrange for your horse to travel with them. Cost you eight gold for transport, but the horse would get home safe.\"\n\nEight gold. More than the sale price. But Thunderhoof would go home to Matthew. To the stable where he belonged. To the boy who'd named him and groomed him and loved him.\n\nI counted out the coins.\n\nMaria tucked them away with a knowing look. \"You're spending money you can't afford on sentiment. That's either very stupid or very human.\" She smiled slightly. \"Usually both.\" She pulled out a ledger. \"I'll need the address in Conducere. Where should the caravan deliver him?\"\n\n\"Logicali household. Merchant district, third warehouse row.\" I recited the address I'd grown up with. \"Kyle is the groundskeeper. He'll know what to do.\"\n\nShe wrote it down with precise script. \"And you'll want to send a letter explaining the arrangement. The caravan master will deliver it with the horse.\"\n\nI borrowed paper and ink from her. The blank page stared back at me. What could I say? That I was sorry? That I'd had to leave?\n\nI started writing three times. Crossed it out twice. Finally settled on something that felt less like lying.\n\nFather,\n\nI'm in Portare. Thunderhoof is coming home with the merchant caravan. Should arrive in two weeks.\n\nTell Matthew he took good care of him. Tell Catherine and Kyle thank you.\n\nI'll write when I reach Regalis.\n\n- Marcus\n\nI folded it before I could second-guess myself. My hand was shaking slightly. Everything I wanted to say—apologies, explanations, justifications—stayed trapped in my chest where it belonged.\n\nThe letter was inadequate. But anything more would be worse.\n\nMaria tucked the note away with the coins. \"He'll get home safe.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" I paused. \"Eight gold to send home a horse I could've sold for six. Pretty sure this is the opposite of sound merchant practice.\"\n\nMaria's knowing look didn't change. \"Or it proves you know what matters.\"\n\nGustin and I walked back toward our rooms. He'd gained four gold. I'd lost eight. The difference felt larger than twelve coins—it felt like the difference between someone who had choices and someone who didn't.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Gustin said suddenly.\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For the ship passage.\" He paused at his door. \"For... treating this like it matters.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. So I just nodded.\n\n\"Let's find a ship,\" I said.\n\n~~~\n\nWe grabbed our midday meal from the kitchen and headed back out. My feet already ached from walking on cobblestones all morning, and I was aware of how much we'd crammed into a few hours—finding the trader, watching Gustin sell his pony, making the decision about Thunderhoof, writing the letter.\n\nThe sun was past its peak now. We still had to find a ship before the day ended.\n\n\"Ready for this?\" Gustin asked as we approached the harbor district.\n\n\"Not remotely.\"\n\nThe smell hit first—salt and rotting fish mixing with tar from fresh-sealed hulls and wood smoke from food stalls. Then the noise. Portare's southern harbor was chaos.\n\nShips lined the docks in rows—merchant vessels, fishing boats, naval frigates with Bahia's blue-and-white colors, massive cargo haulers. Sailors shouted in three different languages I couldn't identify. Someone was singing a work song while loading cargo. A crane squealed overhead, swinging a massive cargo net that cast a moving shadow across the dock. The smell was overwhelming—salt and fish and tar and cooking smoke from food stalls wedged between warehouses.\n\n\"First time at sea?\" A woman leaning against a dock post grinned at us. She wore sailor's clothes and had a knife at her belt that looked well-used.\n\n\"That obvious?\" I asked.\n\n\"You're both starin' at the water like it owed ya money.\" She pushed off the post. \"Lookin' for a ship?\"\n\n\"To Navale, Regalis,\" Gustin said.\n\n\"Three rows down. Merchant's Row. Fair warnin'—it's two weeks if the weather's kind to ya. Three if it ain't. And it ain't never kind.\" She laughed at our faces. \"You'll live. Most do.\"\n\nWe found Merchant's Row by following the crowd. A dozen ships were loading cargo, captains and first mates shouting prices and departure times.\n\n\"So,\" Gustin said as we approached the docks. \"Two cabins if we can get them, double berth if not?\"\n\n\"That's what the sailor said was best. And he was right about needing privacy for teaching.\" I looked at the chaos ahead. \"Let's split up. You check the northern ships, I'll take the southern rows. Meet back in an hour?\"\n\n\"Sounds good. Looking for the Dawnbreaker or Seafire, right?\"\n\n\"Those, or anything that looks clean and well-maintained.\"\n\nWe separated into the chaos.\n\nI checked several ships. The Seafire first—pristine white sails, fresh varnish smell, but sixty gold per person for a single cabin and shared berths already sold out. The Pearl Wind looked worn but functional, sailors efficiently loading cargo, eight gold per head for hammock space. The Eastern Promise sat lower in the water, patched sails and the smell of rotting rope, deck stained with what looked like years of neglect. I kept moving.\n\nThe Dawnbreaker caught my attention. Clean lines, well-maintained rigging, professional crew working with practiced efficiency. The smell of fresh tar and the sharp orders from officers suggested a ship run tight and proper.\n\n\"Help ya?\" The First Mate barely glanced at me, busy checking cargo manifests.\n\n\"Looking for passage to Navale, Regalis. Two passengers. Any berths available?\"\n\nShe consulted her ledger, flipping pages with practiced efficiency. \"All berths sold. Shared cabins went this morning, singles yesterday.\"\n\nMy stomach dropped. \"Hammocks?\"\n\n\"Six gold per head. Twelve total for two.\" She started to turn away, already moving to the next task.\n\nThe afternoon was fading when I found Gustin near the southern docks—he'd finished checking the northern row and moved down. He'd had the same luck—everything was either sold out or looked questionable.\n\n\"Maria said to check with her before booking,\" I said. \"We should go back.\"\n\n~~~\n\nWe found Maria in the late afternoon, reviewing accounts at her desk. She looked up when we entered.\n\n\"Any luck at the docks?\" she asked.\n\n\"Everything's sold out,\" Gustin said. \"Singles, doubles, everything except hammocks.\"\n\n\"Which ships did you check?\"\n\nI listed them—Seafire, Pearl Wind, Dawnbreaker, a few others.\n\nMaria nodded slowly. \"The Dawnbreaker. Captain Ross.\" She set down her pen. \"That's a good ship. Professional crew, treats passengers fairly.\" She paused, considering. \"Shared berths run twenty-five to thirty gold per person. Can you manage that?\"\n\nI did the math. Fifty to sixty gold total. \"That's... most of what I have.\"\n\n\"Then book hammocks,\" she said practically. \"Six to eight gold per person—you can manage that. Uncomfortable, but you'll arrive.\"\n\nGustin looked disappointed but nodded.\n\nMaria pulled a small card from her desk drawer and began writing. \"Take this too. Sometimes passengers don't show up on departure day. Ships would rather fill empty berths at a discount than sail with them vacant.\" She handed me the card. \"I've hosted the Dawnbreaker's crew before—Captain Ross knows me. If any cabins open up when you board tomorrow, show this to the First Mate. It won't guarantee anything, but it might help.\"\n\nI looked at the card. Just Maria's name and a brief note in neat script.\n\n\"We should still book the hammocks tonight?\" I asked.\n\n\"Absolutely. Secure your passage first. Then when you show up to board tomorrow, check if anything's opened up. Worst case, you sail in hammocks. Best case, you negotiate an upgrade.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Gustin said.\n\n\"Don't thank me yet. Go book those hammocks before they sell out too.\"\n\n~~~\n\nWe made it back to Merchant's Row as the sun started lowering. The Dawnbreaker was still loading cargo, crew working with the same efficient purpose.\n\nThe First Mate was overseeing the final cargo loading when we approached. \"Help ya?\"\n\n\"Hammock space for two to Navale, Regalis,\" I said.\n\nShe consulted her ledger, flipping pages with practiced efficiency. \"Six gold per head. Twelve total.\" She held out her hand.\n\nI counted out twelve gold coins.\n\n\"Names?\"\n\n\"Marcus Logicali and Gustin Green.\"\n\nShe marked it down. \"Hammock deck, starboard side. We sail dawn tomorrow. Board by first bell or we leave without ya.\" She waved us off, already turning to the next customer.\n\nWe headed back toward the Tidewatch. Gustin looked disappointed but trying to hide it. \"At least we're on the ship.\"\n\n\"And we have Maria's card,\" I said. \"If any cabins open up tomorrow when we board...\"\n\n\"Worth trying,\" he said. \"Though I'm trying not to get my hopes up.\"\n\n\"Same.\"\n\nWe left the docks as the sun started lowering. I pulled out my coin purse as we walked, counting what remained. Seventy gold remaining, maybe a bit less. We'd see what tomorrow brought.\n\nLodging in Mali. Meals. Supplies. Academy fees if they even let me test. Maybe two months if I was careful. Three if I found work.\n\nAnd if Academia Midur rejected me? Then what?\n\n\"Marcus—\" Gustin's voice went tight.\n\nI looked up. Three men had stepped out from an alley ahead of us, spreading across the narrow street. Another two behind. Not dock workers—wrong clothes, wrong posture. The kind of people who waited for tired travelers counting gold in the open like idiots.\n\n\"Coin purse,\" the lead one said. Scar across his jaw, relaxed stance that said he'd done this before. \"Hand it over. No one gets hurt.\"\n\nMy hand was still holding the purse. Fifty-nine gold. Everything I had left.\n\nGustin's breathing had gone shallow beside me. His fingers started tracing patterns in the air—drawing a runic array, probably Barrier. Five, six seconds if he was fast. The thieves would notice any moment.\n\nRicardo's voice in my head: They've committed. Use it.\n\nI dropped the coin purse.\n\nThe lead man's eyes tracked it down. Half a second of distraction.\n\nI moved.\n\nTerra Form—the earth under his lead foot shifted, just enough. He stumbled forward, balance gone. I stepped inside his guard, swept his legs with my own. He went down hard. The man to his right was reaching for a knife. I kicked his knee sideways, heard it pop, pivoted and drove my elbow into the third man's solar plexus. He folded.\n\nThe two behind us—one was already running. The other hesitated, saw his three friends on the ground, and bolted.\n\nTotal time: maybe three seconds.\n\nI picked up my coin purse. My hands weren't even shaking.\n\nBehind me, a faint shimmer appeared in the air. Gustin's Barrier materialized between us and the fleeing attackers—a translucent wall of force that faded as soon as he realized the fight was over.\n\n\"What—\" He stared at the three men on the ground. One was groaning, clutching his knee. The leader was trying to get up, failed, stayed down. \"What just happened?\"\n\n\"They left.\" I pocketed the coins. \"We should too. Before they reconsider or find friends.\"\n\n\"But you—\" Gustin was still staring. \"You moved so fast I didn't even—by the time I finished the array, they were already—\"\n\n\"Ricardo's training.\" I started walking. \"Come on.\"\n\n\"But—\"\n\n\"Five years of sword forms I thought were pointless,\" I said. \"Turns out they're very good for hitting people who want my coin. Valuable life skill.\"\n\n\"You're joking right now?\"\n\n\"Would you prefer I panic? Because I can do that too. Later. When we're not standing next to three angry men.\"\n\nHe followed, glancing back twice. \"That was... I've never seen anyone move like that. You used Terra Form, I saw it, but you were already hitting the first one before I even registered you'd cast—\"\n\n\"Can we talk about this somewhere else?\" My heart was starting to catch up to what had just happened. Adrenaline made my legs feel strange.\n\n\"Right. Yes. Somewhere else.\"\n\nWe walked faster. Behind us, the three men were still on the ground. No one came after us.\n\n\"How did you—\" Gustin started.\n\n\"Not here. Let's just get back.\"\n\nWe moved quickly through the streets, putting distance between us and the alley. But Gustin couldn't hold back.\n\n\"I'm trying to figure out what I actually saw,\" he said, voice low but urgent. \"You dropped the coin purse, they looked down, and then... you were already moving. I saw Terra Form—the earth shifted under his foot. But you'd already started the leg sweep before the spell even manifested.\"\n\n\"Ricardo drilled the movements together for five years.\"\n\n\"But that's not—\" He glanced over his shoulder, then back to me. \"Marcus, you just cast Terra Form mid-combat while simultaneously executing a sword form. That's not normal. That's not even close to normal.\"\n\nThe sun was sliding toward the horizon. The crowds had thinned, most people heading home for dinner.\n\n\"I don't know what to tell you,\" I said, keeping my voice low. \"It's just how Ricardo taught me.\"\n\n\"Did he know? That you were doing something unusual?\"\n\nI thought about that. \"Maybe. He never said it directly. But he kept pushing me to integrate faster, move smoother. Said magic and movement had to be one thing, not two.\"\n\n\"One thing.\" Gustin walked in silence for a moment, processing. \"Not cast-then-move. Not move-then-cast. One action.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I kept walking. \"Turns out five years of resenting sword practice actually prepared me for street robbery. Very practical education.\"\n\n\"You're joking about this.\"\n\n\"Would you prefer I panic now? I'm saving that for when we're safely inside.\"\n\nWe turned onto the street where Tidewatch stood, the painted lighthouse sign visible ahead.\n\nBy the time we reached the entrance, I was shaking—not from fear, from the aftermath. The realization of what could have gone wrong hit me all at once.\n\n\"You alright?\" Gustin asked.\n\n\"Fine. Just tired.\" It wasn't entirely a lie.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" Gustin said. \"Then we're actually doing this.\"\n\n\"Then we're actually doing this,\" I agreed.\n\n~~~\n\nThat evening, Maria brought us dinner herself—fish stew and fresh bread. She set down the bowls, then lingered. \"How was your day at the docks? Find what you needed?\"\n\n\"Booked passage on the Dawnbreaker,\" I said. \"Leaves tomorrow at dawn.\"\n\n\"Good ship. Captain Ross is reliable.\" She studied us both. \"Anything else happen?\"\n\nGustin glanced at me, then back to Maria. \"We... had an incident. On the way back.\"\n\n\"What kind of incident?\"\n\n\"Five men tried to rob us,\" Gustin said. He was still processing it, I could tell. \"Marcus was counting coins in the street—stupid, I know—and they surrounded us. Demanded the coin purse.\"\n\nMaria's expression went flat. \"Where?\"\n\n\"Three streets from the harbor. Near the warehouses.\" Gustin leaned forward. \"But that's not—the thing is, they were professionals. Positioned us between them, outnumbered us. I started casting Barrier the moment I saw them, but spell arrays take time to construct—five, six seconds even when you're panicking.\"\n\n\"And?\" Maria looked at me.\n\nI focused on my stew. \"It was fine. They left.\"\n\n\"They left because Marcus put three of them on the ground before I even finished my spell,\" Gustin said. \"I've never seen anyone move like that. He dropped the coin purse—distracted the leader—then it was like... I don't even know how to describe it. He used Terra Form to trip the first one, then just—\" He gestured helplessly. \"By the time my Barrier materialized, all three were down. One with a dislocated knee. The other two ran.\"\n\nMaria was watching me now with a different kind of attention. \"You've had sword training.\"\n\n\"Five years,\" I said quietly. \"My instructor—Ricardo—trained me in Sahash-Dorh Kata. He integrated Terra Form into the movements. Said magic and combat had to be one thing, not two.\"\n\n\"And your spell—how fast?\"\n\nI met her eyes. \"Sub-second. Maybe faster if I'm not thinking about it.\"\n\nMaria was silent for a moment. Then she nodded slowly. \"I don't know much about magic, but from what Gustin's describing—five men trying to rob you, and you put three down before he finished casting.\" She set down her empty tray. \"Whatever you're doing, it works.\"\n\n\"It's just Ricardo's training,\" I said.\n\n\"No,\" Gustin said firmly. \"It's not. Chief Aldric stops to cast, then moves. Old man Corvin does the same. Everyone does.\" He shook his head. \"But you just used it in actual combat. Against multiple opponents. That's different from practice.\"\n\n\"Ricardo drilled it that way.\"\n\n\"And it worked.\" Gustin's voice had an edge of excitement. \"It actually worked.\"\n\n\"Against street thieves,\" I said. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Ricardo would remind me those were amateurs who gave me every advantage. One spell and some luck doesn't make me dangerous. It makes me slightly less pathetic than five untrained muggers.\"\n\n\"That's not the point—\"\n\n\"The point is I barely survived getting robbed and now you two are planning my revolutionary magical career.\" I took a drink. \"Can we maybe celebrate not dying before we worry about academy politics?\"\n\nMaria glanced around the common room, then back to us, voice lower. \"You should worry about that, though. Tower mages here in Portare—they get set in their ways about how things should be done.\" Her expression was serious. \"If the academy is anything like that, showing them something different won't make you friends.\"\n\nI hadn't thought about that. I'd been so focused on whether the academy would accept me that I hadn't considered what would happen if I demonstrated something they didn't expect.\n\n\"I'm not trying to prove anyone wrong,\" I said quietly. \"I just want to learn.\"\n\n\"I know. But intent doesn't always matter.\" She straightened up. \"I have something for you both.\" She pulled out a sealed letter from her apron. \"My cousin runs a trading house in Navale. Show him this when you arrive. He owes me a favor.\"\n\nShe handed me the letter. I stared at it.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\n\"Isabella asked me to look out for you.\" Her expression softened, then she glanced at Gustin. \"That goes for both of you. Having connections never hurts. Especially when you're trying something difficult.\"\n\nAfter she left, Gustin was quiet for a moment. \"People keep helping us.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nI thought about Isabella giving me coin and letters. Maria arranging passage and contacts. Even Loren Wolf taking reduced rates for the caravan.\n\n\"Maybe because they remember what it was like,\" I said. \"Being young and trying something impossible.\"\n\n\"Or maybe they just pity us.\"\n\n\"Maybe. But I'll take pity over nothing.\"\n\nWe finished dinner and headed upstairs. Tomorrow we'd sail. Tomorrow everything would change.\n\nBut tonight, I lay in bed listening to the distant sound of waves against the harbor walls and thought about everyone I'd left behind.\n\nRicardo's voice kept coming back: You're not running from your father. You're running from the person you'll become if you stay.\n\nI pulled out my sword. The blade caught moonlight from the window, clean and perfectly balanced. Ricardo had commissioned the matched pair when I was ten—five years ago now, though it felt like a lifetime.\n\nEither I'd found something the academies missed, or I'd spent five years perfecting a trick that wouldn't matter. Tomorrow I'd start finding out which.\n\nI set the sword down. Through the window, I could see a lamppost on the street below—a crystal atop the post glowing with steady light. Light runes carved into the crystal, drawing ambient Urja to illuminate the street. Common magic, so routine no one even noticed it anymore.\n\nThat's what I wanted. Not to be extraordinary—just to be normal enough that magic was a tool, not a dream I'd never reach.\n\nI tried to sleep.\n\n~~~\n\nThe Dawnbreaker was ready to sail at dawn.\n\nGustin and I arrived together, packs on our backs. The deck was chaos—passengers boarding, crew loading last-minute cargo, officers shouting orders. We found the First Mate checking off names from her manifest.\n\n\"Logicali and Green,\" I said. \"Hammock passage.\"\n\nShe ran her finger down the list, found our names. \"Hammock deck's that way—\" She started to point, then I pulled out Maria's card.\n\n\"Maria Castelli asked me to show you this. She mentioned checking for cabin openings?\"\n\nThe First Mate stopped, read the card. Her expression shifted—recognition, then calculation. She checked her manifest again, ran her finger down a different column. \"Huh.\" She tapped a line. \"Family of four. Booked the shared cabin weeks ago. Didn't show.\" She looked at us, then back at the card. \"You're Maria's people?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nShe considered for a moment, glancing at the empty gangway where the family should have been. \"Can't let it sail empty—captain loses money. And Maria's vouching for you means I don't have to worry about trouble.\" She made a note. \"Fifteen gold per person. Thirty total. You already paid twelve for hammocks, so that's eighteen more. I can move you to the cabin.\"\n\nI glanced at Gustin. Eighteen gold more than we'd planned. But privacy for teaching, and we'd still save twenty compared to full price.\n\nHe nodded.\n\nI counted out eighteen gold coins. Forty-one gold left—not much for surviving Mali, but enough to start.\n\nShe marked the change in her ledger. \"Cabin twelve, second deck. Down that way. Stow your gear fast—we sail in twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\nShe waved us off, already calling the next name.\n\nGustin exhaled as we headed below deck. \"I can't believe that actually worked.\"\n\n\"Maria's card saved us twenty gold,\" I said. \"Still expensive, but we get privacy.\"\n\n\"Thirty gold for teaching space instead of twelve for hammocks.\" He shook his head. \"But if your Ignite attempts go badly, now only one of us will get burned instead of the whole hammock deck.\"\n\n\"That's... probably safer for everyone.\"\n\nWe found Cabin 12—barely larger than a closet, with bunk beds and a narrow shelf. We stowed our gear quickly. Gustin took the top bunk.\n\nThe crew worked with practiced efficiency, coiling lines and preparing sails. Within the hour, the ship began to move.\n\nPortare's harbor slowly fell away behind us. The sea spread out in all directions, blue and endless and terrifying in its scale. The wind filled the sails. The ship moved northeast, beginning the long journey around Vallis toward the Deep Sea, then south to Regalis and the ancient forests and the river that would take us to Mali.\n\nTwo weeks at sea. Two weeks to learn what Gustin could teach me. Two weeks before I'd find out if running toward Mali was bravery or just another flavor of running away.\n\nI watched the horizon and tried to believe it was the former.",

            "content_text": "Chapter 4 - The Sea Voyage\n\nThe Dawnbreaker smelled like salt and tar and wood that had spent too many years soaking in seawater.\n\nPortare shrank behind us, the buildings compressing into a line of color against the hillside. The harbor grew smaller. The sea grew larger. And somewhere in the transition between visible land and water stretching to every horizon, the full weight of what I'd done slammed into my chest like a stone.\n\nI'd stolen from my father. Left my home. Spent forty gold on passage and logistics in just two days—nearly half of everything I had—chasing an academy after being rejected twice.\n\nI gripped the rail. The water beneath the hull was deep. Deeper than I wanted to consider.\n\nThe forty-one gold in my satchel felt heavier than the sea below. Most of it stolen from my father. Ten from Lucia. The theft gnawed at my chest—not just the money, but the hiding place. His hiding place. Behind my mother's portrait where he'd thought no one would look.\n\nThere had been reasons. Good reasons that made sense in my room at midnight, counting coins by candlelight. But standing on deck with shore gone and water in every direction, I couldn't remember what they were anymore. Just the weight in my satchel and the knowledge that I'd broken something I couldn't repair.\n\nFather would appreciate the irony—his lessons in merchant pragmatism funding my escape from merchant life. Very economical.\n\n~~~\n\nMovement to my left. Gustin appeared at the rail beside me, his face the sickly gray-green of someone about to vomit, sweat beading at his temples.\n\n\"Marcus.\" His voice was strained. \"I think I'm—\"\n\nHe didn't finish. Just lurched forward and vomited over the side.\n\nI grabbed his shoulder to steady him as the ship rolled. \"At least you made it to the rail.\"\n\n\"Small victories,\" he managed, then retched again. His face went paler. \"What if the academy sees this? Can't even handle a boat. Some wizard I'll make.\"\n\n\"Seasickness has nothing to do with magical ability.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it?\" He gripped the rail, knuckles white. \"Everything's a test. Physical endurance, mental discipline. If I can't even—\" He broke off to vomit again.\n\nA sailor with a coil of rope paused nearby, barely glancing at us. \"First voyage?\"\n\n\"What gave it away?\"\n\n\"Yer holdin' him wrong.\" The sailor moved behind me, repositioning my hands on Gustin's shoulders. \"Get behind him—support his weight against the rail so he don't go over when the ship pitches.\"\n\nI adjusted as he'd shown, bracing Gustin from behind. It worked better. The next wave of nausea hit, but he stayed upright.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I called after the sailor.\n\n\"Ya both get used to it,\" came the reply. \"Or ya won't. Either way, a few weeks is plenty of time to find out.\"\n\nEncouraging. Though Gustin's question stuck—did physical resilience determine magical worth? Another arbitrary threshold, like Mi values?\n\nThough I supposed starting my journey to prove I could be a wizard by holding a sick friend over a ship's rail had a certain poetic quality. Very heroic.\n\nGustin straightened slowly, wiping his mouth. His cheeks were blotched red—not just from nausea.\n\n\"The academy won't care if you were seasick on the way there.\"\n\n\"Won't they?\" He wouldn't meet my eyes. \"Forty-eight Mi, barely made the cut. Village scraped together every copper. And I can't even keep breakfast down on a calm day.\"\n\n\"Could be worse. You could have done that in the cabin.\"\n\n\"That's not comforting.\"\n\n\"It's accurate.\" I hesitated, then added, \"Besides, I'm at forty-five Mi and not puking. Does that make me the better wizard?\"\n\nHe actually laughed—weak, but real. \"Point taken.\"\n\n\"I hate you,\" he said, but with less venom.\n\n\"I know.\" The deck tilted beneath us. I kept my grip on his shoulder. \"Want to try going below?\"\n\n\"No. Fresh air helps. I think.\" He took a shaky breath. \"Maybe.\"\n\nFootsteps approached from behind. A woman's voice, professional and amused. \"Cabin twelve holding up?\"\n\nI turned. The First Mate had her ledger tucked under one arm.\n\n\"So far.\"\n\nShe glanced at Gustin, still leaning heavily on the rail. \"Yer friend's discovered why hammock passengers don't complain about the smell. Hard to notice when yer this sick.\"\n\n\"He's adapting.\"\n\n\"Slowly.\" She made a note in her ledger without looking down. \"Meals at sixth, ninth, and fifteenth bell. Water's rationed—one cup per person per day unless we hit rain. Sick over the side, not below deck.\" She gestured at Gustin. \"He's got that part right, at least.\"\n\n\"I'll make sure he remembers.\"\n\n\"Good. Because if ya vomit in my corridors, ya clean them with yer own shirt.\" She wasn't joking. \"Meals come with passage—no extra coin needed. Ya pay for the cabin, ya eat with the crew. Simple.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\n\"Try not to die before we get there.\"\n\n\"We'll do our best.\"\n\n\"See that ya do.\" She checked something in her ledger. \"Captain Ross has been sailin' this route for twenty years. Never lost a ship, never lost crew. Two to three weeks to Navale if weather holds and currents are kind, three or four if they're not. Let's keep that record intact.\"\n\nShe left before I could respond.\n\n\"Cheerful,\" Gustin muttered.\n\n\"Efficient,\" I corrected. \"There's a difference.\"\n\nThis was going to be a long few weeks.\n\n~~~\n\nWe headed below for the evening meal. The mess hall was cramped. Long tables, benches bolted to the floor, the smell of salted fish that had probably perfumed this space since the ship's first voyage. Gustin sat at the far end, barely touching his stew.\n\nI grabbed a plate and sat across from him. The ship's water ration—one cup per person per day—tasted like the barrel's entire history, every voyage it had crossed stored in that faint metallic flavor. I drank it anyway. At least it was cold. \"Food's better than I expected.\"\n\n\"Low bar.\" He pushed the stew around. \"Trying to decide if eating helps or makes the seasickness worse.\"\n\nA woman in her thirties sat a few seats down, writing in a journal despite the ship's pitch—the kind of focus I'd seen in my father's warehouse managers, the ones who could inventory cargo while standing on a moving dock. A wooden staff leaned against the bench beside her, leather holster straps worn but carefully maintained. The kind of kit you invested in if you planned to keep using it for years. Seasoned.\n\nThree tables over, a team moved with coordinated efficiency my father's warehouse crews never quite managed. I'd watched plenty of crews over the years—this was different. A tall man with a scarred face, an auburn-haired woman with a small fox curled at her feet, and a Dwarf with elaborate beard braids. They passed equipment between them without asking, the kind of wordless teamwork that comes from years of not dying together. Professional efficiency—the kind that jumps out at you across a room because it doesn't waste energy on coordination. No wasted movement. No wasted words.\n\nThe fox was small, alert, moving with the same coordinated precision as its handlers. Hunters, probably. The fox was a nice touch. Very competent. Very \"we know what we're doing and we know you know we know.\"\n\nFind this and other great novels on the author's preferred platform. Support original creators!\n\nProfessional killers with perfect teamwork. At least when they failed, they'd fail together. Very inspiring.\n\n\"Three weeks of this,\" Gustin muttered. \"Think we'll survive?\"\n\n\"Ask me when we reach Navale.\"\n\nHe managed a weak laugh, then pushed his plate away. \"Come on. Let's get back to the cabin before my stomach gives up entirely.\"\n\n~~~\n\nThe common room outside was louder—sailors arguing over dice, children running between tables, the constant creak of the hull. I followed Gustin through the noise, grateful when the corridor's relative quiet wrapped around us. The ship rolled as we made our way back to Cabin 12.\n\nWe made it inside just as Gustin's face went from green to distinctly pale. He climbed to his bunk and collapsed with a groan.\n\n\"You going to survive?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ask me tomorrow.\"\n\nI left him to his misery and went back up on deck for fresh air, watching the horizon until the nausea settled. By evening, when I returned to check on him, Gustin had recovered enough to climb down from his bunk, though he still looked faintly nauseous. The space was cramped—stacked bunks with barely enough room to sit up on the lower one, a narrow shelf for our packs—but it was private. I'd propped my claymore against the wall near my bunk. The blade barely fit.\n\nHe settled onto the lower bunk beside me and opened his spellbook between us. \"Ready to start?\" he asked. \"Focusing on something other than the waves might help.\"\n\nI pressed against the wall to make room, our shoulders nearly touching in the confined space. \"Teaching me spells I can't cast?\"\n\n\"Deal was I teach you spell theory during the voyage. We just started the voyage.\" He smiled weakly. \"Besides, it's better than lying in my bunk feeling miserable.\"\n\n\"Right. Can't be seasick if you're thinking about fire magic.\" I pulled out my journal and pencil. \"Teach me how to make fire. I'm paying good money to learn spells I can't use—might as well get the full experience.\"\n\n~~~\n\n\"Okay, so—Ignite is a three-rune structure,\" he said, sketching the array on a piece of paper. His lines were precise despite the ship's movement. \"Simpler than what you're already doing, actually. Terra Form has six runes in the basic array—I mean, you've probably internalized them without realizing it.\"\n\nHe sketched three runes forming a triangle within a circle, connecting lines creating a circuit. His lines stayed precise despite the ship's movement.\n\n\"Heat rune first,\" he said, tapping the top point. \"Generates thermal energy until, like, combustion happens—\"\n\n\"Until combustion,\" I guessed, studying the symbol. \"Makes sense. But wouldn't the heat spread everywhere? Burn your own hand?\"\n\n\"That's what Direction is for.\" He tapped the lower left rune of the triangle. \"Aims the heat—usually your fingertip, wherever you're pointing. Without it...\" He grimaced. \"Bad things happen. Corvin showed me the burn scars from experimenting wrong.\"\n\n\"And the third is Stabilization?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Same one Terra Form uses. It, uh, holds the heat concentration for a second or two so the target material has time to catch. Without it, heat just disperses too fast. Or, I mean, that's what Corvin said.\"\n\nI copied the array into my journal, trying to match his proportions. A swell lifted the deck, making my lines waver. \"So it's like Terra Form's structure—generate effect, direct it, stabilize it.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The key is—okay, so the Heat rune needs to overload. You have to force more Mana through it than it can handle. That's what causes the thermal release. Too little Mana and nothing happens. Too much and...\" He grimaced. \"Well, you probably burn yourself.\"\n\n\"How do you know how much is right?\"\n\n\"Practice. Lots of practice.\" He flipped to another page in his spellbook. \"Most mages spend weeks learning to sense the threshold. You channel Mana gradually, feeling for the point where the rune starts to resist. That resistance is the overload point—at least, that's how Corvin explained it.\"\n\nI studied the array. Three runes. Simpler than I'd expected, but the principle made sense. \"Can I try drawing it?\"\n\n\"On paper, sure. We're not attempting actual casting in a wooden cabin on a ship.\" He slid his spellbook over. \"Copy it a few times. Get the proportions right. The runes need to be balanced or the circuit won't form properly.\"\n\nI spent the next hour drawing circles and runes while Gustin corrected my line work. An hour of copying fire runes I'd probably never ignite. At least my lines were getting straighter. Very consoling.\n\nThe hull pitched with the waves. My stomach protested. But the geometric precision of the runic array cut through the nausea.\n\n\"Good,\" Gustin said finally, examining my fifth attempt. \"That's actually correct. The connecting lines are straight, the runes are proportional. If you could channel Mana, this would probably work. I mean, I think it would.\"\n\n\"Probably?\"\n\n\"I'm not an expert. I can cast Ignite, but I don't fully understand why this specific pattern creates fire. Old man Corvin—my teacher—he just said 'this is the pattern, memorize it.' Never explained the theory behind it.\" He flipped to a page in his spellbook where neat handwriting sat alongside the etched array. \"But he did teach me the optimization chant. Want to see the finger choreography?\"\n\nI nodded. Even if I couldn't cast it, understanding the full technique felt important.\n\nHe demonstrated slowly, hands moving through precise gestures while he murmured the chant under his breath. Two-handed pattern—academic standard, apparently faster than one-handed variants. His fingers traced invisible lines in the air, each movement corresponding to a note in the rhythm. Heat, Direction, Stabilization—the three runes formed through coordinated motion.\n\n\"Corvin made me practice this for weeks before I ever channeled Mana through it,\" Gustin said. \"Get the movements perfect first, then add power. Safer that way.\"\n\nI copied the gestures awkwardly, trying to match his fluid motion. My hands felt clumsy compared to his practiced ease.\n\n\"Not bad for first try,\" he said. \"You'll get it. Just repetition.\"\n\nI looked at the array. Three simple runes. Centuries of refinement distilled into an elegant solution. \"Someone had to figure this out originally. Had to be the first person to discover that this combination produces this effect.\"\n\n\"Right. But how?\" Gustin shifted beside me on the bunk. \"I mean, did they just try random combinations until something worked? That could take lifetimes.\"\n\n\"They studied nature,\" I said. My mother had taught me that runes exist naturally—in animals, plants, everything that uses Urja. Wizards observe, extract the patterns, adapt them.\n\nMy mother had taught me earth magic years ago, before she died. Now I was learning fire magic, and she wasn't here to see it.\n\nI'd kept practicing anyway—through the empty garden years, through every rejection letter, through two failed academy tests. Apparently that habit didn't break just because I'd left home.\n\n\"So somewhere there's a creature that naturally creates fire?\"\n\n\"Probably. Fire-breathing drakes. Ember serpents. Phoenix if the stories are true.\" I tapped the Heat rune. \"Someone observed how they generate heat, found the underlying pattern, turned it into a spell.\"\n\nGustin's eyes lit up with that same intensity I'd seen during the caravan journey. \"Wait, that's brilliant! Which means—okay, hear me out—theoretically, any natural effect could become a spell if you understood the runes, right?\"\n\nForty-five Mi. The number that had closed every door—written on test results, stamped on rejection letters, the final word on whether I was worth the academies' time. \"If you had high enough Mi to crystallize Mana, yeah.\"\n\nThe words came out sharp-edged. He winced.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I added. \"Not your fault.\"\n\n\"No, you're right to be angry.\" He closed the spellbook. \"The whole system is—I mean, you're sitting at forty-five Mi. Technically you can crystallize. But the academies act like you're worthless because you're at the minimum.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to make me feel better or worse?\"\n\n\"Neither. Just acknowledging it's unfair.\" He met my eyes. \"I'm at forty-eight. Three points higher. That's the only difference between me getting an acceptance letter and you having to chase a maybe. Three points. Like some committee of old wizards decided that forty-four was human, forty-five was nothing, forty-six was still nothing, and forty-eight? That's finally worth their time.\"\n\n\"You didn't steal money to get here.\"\n\n\"No, but my whole village pooled resources to pay for my testing and travel. Old man Corvin used his savings for my ship passage—\" He stopped himself. \"Well, he tried to. That money's probably going back to him now that you paid for this cabin.\"\n\nI hadn't thought about that. \"Will you send it back?\"\n\n\"If we make it to Mali and I actually get accepted, yeah. If I fail...\" He trailed off. \"Then I'll need every copper I have left.\"\n\nThe floor shifted beneath us. We both braced ourselves against the bunk frame.\n\n\"Aldric commissioned this spellbook for me.\" Gustin pulled out the worn leather journal I'd seen before. \"Blank parchment—the good kind, beast skin, not cheap paper. Had to buy different grades for different spells. Corvin figured out which ones I'd need.\" He traced the worn cover. \"Every array in here, I etched myself. Every single one. Because that's how you prove you've actually learned the spell, not just copied someone else's work.\" His finger paused on a particular worn spot. \"Cost more than the village could afford, really. But they needed me to have it before I left. So they scraped together the coin anyway.\"\n\nHe opened to a page near the middle—a perfectly etched runic array surrounded by Corvin's original drawings on paper, the master version his teacher had drawn for reference. \"This is Ignite. Took me three weeks to get confident enough to etch it on the parchment. Because once you etch, that's it—you waste expensive beast skin if you mess up.\" He looked up. \"All because I hit forty-eight on the Mi scale instead of forty-five. Forty-eight. Like that's the difference between legitimate wizard and fraud.\"\n\nThe observation landed sideways. I stared at the spellbook, the calculation shifting in my head: Forty-one gold in my satchel. Gustin had sold his pony for four.\n\n\"At least you had money to take,\" he said quietly. \"You paid for a shared cabin on this ship. When I run out of coin, I don't have a father's warehouses to draw from. I've got nothing except what people scraped together.\"\n\nThe words hit harder than they should have. I'd spent more on this cabin upgrade than his entire horse was worth. The math was simple, even if I didn't want to look at it.\n\nMoney. Resources. A safety net, even if I'd cut myself off from it. I'd gambled on myself with better odds than Gustin could afford.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I didn't mean to—\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.\" He held up a hand. \"I'm just saying we're both carrying weight. Mine is what I owe. Yours is what you had and walked away from.\" His smile was tired. \"Different kinds of heavy. Different kinds of stupid, maybe.\"\n\n\"So we both need to succeed,\" I said after a moment. \"You because your village is counting on you. Me because apparently I need to prove I'm not delusional about ignition spells and hand gestures.\"\n\n\"Seems about right.\" The ship rolled again. \"Want to know the worst part? I'm terrified I'll get to Mali and fail anyway. That forty-eight Mi won't be enough either. That they'll test me and find out I'm barely better than anyone else who scraped past Om Point. That all this—\" He gestured at the spellbook, his hands, the whole cramped cabin, \"—all of this was for nothing.\"\n\n\"If you fail,\" I said when the world stabilized, \"at least you'll fail with an acceptance letter. I'm going in without even that much. Which means if I fail, I fail alone.\"\n\n\"That's either really brave or really stupid.\"\n\n\"Someone already told me that exact thing in Portare. I'm still not sure which it is.\"\n\n\"Probably both.\"\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, the ship creaking around us, the sea endless beyond the tiny porthole. Two failures in training, one with official credentials and one without. One carrying the weight of his village. One carrying the weight of his father's money.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" Gustin said finally. \"We'll practice the finger choreography for Ignite. Get you ready to attempt the array drawing with Mana instead of just ink.\"\n\n\"Even though I probably can't cast it?\"\n\n\"Even though. You said you wanted to understand how standard spells work. This is how you learn.\" He stood, steadying himself against the wall. \"Besides, maybe you'll surprise us.\"\n\nI doubted it. But I appreciated the thought.\n\nThe lamp swung overhead as the ship rolled. Outside our porthole, the sea stretched dark and endless.\n\nWeeks of this. Learning spells I couldn't cast, sailing toward an academy that would probably reject me, spending my father's stolen money on desperate hope.\n\nAt least the cabin didn't move as much as the hammocks below.\n\nSmall victories.",

            "content_text": "Chapter 5 - The Discovery\n\nBy the third day at sea, the ship's roll no longer made my muscles brace. My stomach had stopped heaving. My balance adjusted without conscious thought. Gustin never adjusted. He spent half his time looking vaguely ill and the other half forcing himself to focus on magical theory.\n\nI'd woken before dawn again to practice Kata on deck near the bow. Ricardo had drilled the habit into me—twice daily, morning and evening, no exceptions. Yesterday morning I'd practiced alone, the sailors giving me curious space as I moved through the forms with my sheathed claymore. Today, someone was watching.\n\nThe sailors still kept their distance. The sword was heavy, the deck moved unpredictably, and I had to adapt every stance to compensate for the ship's roll. But the discipline helped. Kept my body sharp. Reminded me who I was beneath the desperation and uncertainty.\n\nThe ship's navigator worked at the bow most mornings—a Dwarf woman with weathered hands moving through spell patterns over a mounted crystal sphere. Detection magic, the kind that read weather and currents. The crew gave her space without being told, the kind of deference reserved for those whose work keeps a ship alive. She never interrupted my practice, just worked steadily at whatever calculations or observations occupied her. Professional magic I couldn't access, performed casually enough to be routine. Inspiring. I filed the technique away. Might need something like that someday—assuming I ever got past academia gates to learn it.\n\n\"Sahash-Dorh Kata.\"\n\nI turned, finishing the form before lowering my blade. The tall man with the scar—one of the Hunters I'd seen in the mess hall—stood a respectful distance away, arms crossed, the mark catching the dawn light.\n\n\"Kael,\" he said, extending a hand. \"Saw you practicing. That's Sahash-Dorh Kata.\"\n\n\"Marcus Logicali.\" I shook his hand, surprised by the grip—firm but not testing. \"Five years under Ricardo.\"\n\n\"Good foundation.\" He gestured toward two figures at different points on deck—an auburn-haired woman near the mast with a fox at her side, and another Dwarf examining equipment near the hold. \"My team. Hunters.\" He turned back to me. \"Keep practicing. Form's solid.\"\n\n\"How did you recognize the Kata?\" I asked.\n\n\"The way you move. Integration's there. Still young.\" He nodded toward my claymore. \"Fifteen, twenty pounds? Daily practice?\" It wasn't a question. \"Good for Qi reserves. Body grows into it.\"\n\nI hadn't thought about it that way. \"Ricardo just said to practice twice daily. Never explained why the weight mattered.\"\n\n\"Most students wait. Use lighter blades. Bodies set before they start real weight.\" He gestured at my stance. \"You started young. Qi deepens as you grow.\" He nodded approvingly. \"Stronger than you'll notice. Give it years.\"\n\nHe turned to leave, then paused. \"Your instructor—Ricardo—he still teaching?\"\n\n\"In Conducere, Mercari.\" I hesitated.\n\n\"I'll remember that.\" Kael's expression was unreadable. \"Keep at it. Foundation's there. Give it years.\"\n\nHe walked away. I stood there, the claymore balanced naturally in my grip for the first time in weeks.\n\nFive years of Ricardo beating technique into me, and a stranger with a scar recognized it in three minutes. Either Kael was exceptionally observant or I was more obvious than I'd thought. Probably both.\n\nA professional Hunter who'd probably never set foot in Conducere just validated my training. The training I'd resented. The training I'd left behind to chase academy dreams. Very poetic.\n\nMy shoulders ached from the practice, but the good kind of ache—the kind that said muscles were building, not breaking.\n\nAfter morning practice, I found Gustin emerging from our cabin. His face had that same greenish cast. He moved carefully, like each step tested his balance. He wanted to show me the difference between theory and execution.\n\n\"Ready to practice magic?\" I asked.\n\n\"I mean, if it gets me out of that cabin, yes. Might help with the nausea—focusing on something other than the waves.\"\n\nNothing cures seasickness like setting things on fire. But I kept that observation to myself.\n\n~~~\n\nThe morning sun had cleared the masts, warming the deck.\n\nThe First Mate was checking rigging nearby. Near the mainmast, crew had stacked several burlap sacks of ballast earth—soil and rocks the ship carried for stability. A few sacks were open, earth spilling onto the deck where sailors had been redistributing weight earlier.\n\nShe glanced at us, curious, but didn't stop us as we found a clear spot near the open ballast sacks.\n\nA few other passengers stopped to watch—bored enough that two young men doing anything qualified as entertainment.\n\n\"I'll demonstrate Ignite first,\" Gustin said, pulling out his spellbook for reference even though he clearly didn't need it. He produced a small candle from his pocket. \"Watch the timing.\"\n\nHe positioned the candle at arm's length, steadying it against the ship's movement. Then he took a breath, closed his eyes, and began.\n\nHis right hand moved through the gestures deliberately—index finger tracing upward, middle finger extending to point at the wick, ring finger circling smoothly. His lips moved in the incantation. I couldn't hear the words over the wind and waves, but I could see the concentration. The focus. The methodical execution of every step.\n\nThree seconds. Maybe four.\n\nThe array completed and heat exploded from his fingertip—a sudden thermal burst that made the air shimmer. The candle wick ignited instantly, flame springing to life as if struck by lightning rather than gradually kindled.\n\nGustin opened his eyes, breathing harder than the effort should have required. \"That's it. That's as fast as I can cast. I've been practicing Ignite for three years and it's always three to four seconds. Never faster. Barrier takes me five or six—more runes, more complex.\"\n\n\"Show me again. Slower this time.\"\n\nHe did. This time I watched his hands, his stance, the way his whole body committed to the casting. His right hand rose—index finger tracing upward. Middle finger extended, pointing. Ring finger circled smoothly. His lips moved as he cast, murmuring syllables in rhythm with each gesture: \"Ta... se... ki.\"\n\nThree seconds again. The candle wick ignited.\n\n\"What were you saying?\" I asked. \"During the casting.\"\n\n\"Ta-se-ki.\" He held up his right hand, wiggling his fingers in sequence. \"It's a mnemonic—helps me remember the finger choreography. Each syllable tells me which finger to move and how.\"\n\nI stared at him. \"Like... spell words?\"\n\n\"No spell words. Just a learning tool.\" He demonstrated again without casting, moving his fingers slowly. \"'Ta' for when my index finger draws the Heat rune—vertical stroke, like this. 'Se' when my middle finger points for the Direction rune. 'Ki' when my ring finger circles to complete Stabilization.\"\n\n\"You're singing the finger movements.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Academia Midur taught this version—other schools use different syllables for the same spell. Doesn't matter which, as long as your fingers know what to do.\" He gestured at my hands. \"Try it. Repeat the chant while you practice the finger positions.\"\n\nSo Academia Midur turns spellcasting into nursery rhymes. I kept that thought to myself.\n\nI tried to mirror his movements. Right index up—\"Ta.\" Middle finger point—\"Se.\" Ring finger circle—\"Ki.\"\n\nMy fingers tangled. I lost track of which moved when.\n\n\"Again,\" Gustin said. \"Slower. Say the syllable as you move the finger. The rhythm helps.\"\n\n\"Ta-se-ki.\" Index, middle, ring. Vertical stroke, point, circle.\n\nIt took a dozen attempts before the pattern started to feel natural, before the syllables anchored the movements in my mind.\n\n\"This is how you learned all your spells?\" I asked.\n\n\"The simple ones, yes. More complex spells...\" He hesitated. \"There's a whole system of foundation syllables—standard sounds that map to common finger movements. But for Ignite, you don't need all that. Just these three.\"\n\n\"Your turn,\" he said, stepping back. \"I mean, show me your Terra Form. I want to see if—well, if there's something about your version I'm missing.\"\n\nI glanced at the watching passengers—the same small crowd who'd been bored enough to find two young men doing anything entertaining. Most were just killing time between meals.\n\nI stepped closer to the ballast pile. Earth and small rocks spilled across the deck—real soil, not wood. Terra Form needed ground contact, needed earth to manipulate.\n\nI was about to show off for a crowd of bored passengers. Dignified. Exactly how I'd imagined my journey to Mali going.\n\nThe ship rolled beneath me. I waited for the deck to stabilize.\n\nThen I moved.\n\nNot the deliberate gestures Gustin had used. Not the methodical, step-by-step process. Just... moved.\n\nRight foot forward. Weight shifting through the step. The footwork Ricardo had drilled into me for five years—muscle memory carved so deep I couldn't think my way through it anymore.\n\nThe earth rippled.\n\nJust a two-to-three-inch rise in the ballast pile, barely visible. Right where my weight had shifted. Right where an opponent's foot would have landed if this had been a sword fight.\n\nSomeone in the watching crowd made a sound—surprise, maybe. Or pity. Hard to tell which was worse.\n\nI'd just demonstrated the one trick that made me slightly less useless than my Mi value suggested, and now a dozen strangers had witnessed exactly how pathetic it looked when it only moved two inches of dirt.\n\nGustin grinned, staring at where the earth had risen. \"You didn't even stop moving. It was just... part of the motion.\"\n\nThe woman I'd seen writing in the mess hall—the one with the staff and journal—stepped closer, her casual interest hardening into focus. She crouched near the ballast pile, examining the risen earth. \"How long did that take? The casting.\"\n\n\"Less than a second,\" Gustin said.\n\nIf you come across this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen from Royal Road. Please report it.\n\nShe shook her head slowly. \"That's not possible. Standard academy casting runs three to five seconds—years of optimization, and practitioners still need three seconds minimum.\" She looked at me directly. \"Terra Form is a six-rune array. Even simplified, it requires distinct hand positions—sequential finger choreography. You did one motion. No finger movements I could see.\"\n\n\"I don't know how it works,\" I said. \"I practiced Terra Form with the same sword forms, the same footwork, over and over until I stopped thinking about it.\"\n\n\"You learned to cast while moving,\" Gustin said, his eyes wide. \"You never stand still. Ricardo wouldn't let you do it any other way.\"\n\n\"Five years of 'cast while you move or you'll die in a real fight,'\" I confirmed, the memory sharp and brief.\n\nThe First Mate, who'd been working rigging nearby, straightened up with a short laugh. \"Finally, a mage who gets it. Most academy types come aboard castin' like they're standin' on solid ground. First storm rolls through, they're flat on their arses wonderin' why their fancy spellwork went sideways.\" She shot me an approving nod. \"Ship deck's always movin'. Good trainin'.\"\n\nShe went back to her rigging work. Something warm settled in my chest—approval from someone who actually kept ships afloat.\n\nThe woman stared at the risen earth for another moment. \"Can you do it again? I want to try something.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nShe unslung her staff from the leather holster across her back and crouched near the ballast pile where earth had risen. The wood was worn smooth from years of field work, two permanently etched arrays visible along its length. \"I'm going to use Detect Magic—the material analysis variant. It should let me sense the Mana flow patterns when you cast.\" Her fingers found one of the etched sections without looking.\n\nThe staff's tip glowed softly as she activated the pre-etched array and channeled Mana through it. I felt a faint tingle in the air—like the spell was reaching out, probing. \"When you're ready.\"\n\nThe First Mate had stopped working. She watched, one hand resting on a coiled rope, her face hard to read.\n\nI centered my weight and moved through the form again. A different section of the ballast pile rippled, earth rising two inches before settling back.\n\nShe stayed crouched, eyes closed, staff positioned over the affected earth. After a moment she stood slowly, frowning. The glow from her staff faded as she released the spell. \"The Mana flow is there—I can sense the effect propagating through the earth. But I can't trace where it originates.\" She shook her head. \"No external array formation at all. Nothing forming in the air around your hands like standard casting. No focus item signatures either—no wand, no etched jewelry, nothing.\"\n\nShe couldn't see it because I wasn't doing what she thought I was doing. Which would be great—mysterious, even impressive—if I actually understood what I was doing. Instead, I was just the idiot who'd stumbled into something he couldn't explain.\n\nShe tucked the staff under one arm and made a quick sketch in her journal. \"The movement—you're not casting a spell and then moving. You're casting through the movement.\"\n\n\"Wait, that's it!\" Gustin's eyes went wide. \"The physical motion is part of the array structure itself. That's what makes it work—I mean, that has to be it, right?\"\n\nThe woman shook her head slowly. \"That's not just unusual. That's impossible. Spells require arrays. Always.\" She stared at her notes. \"I don't understand the mechanism. Without knowing HOW you're doing this, I can't assess whether it's specific to Terra Form or could apply to other spells. That would require controlled testing I'm not equipped to do here.\" She looked up. \"But what you're doing contradicts fifteen years of my training.\"\n\nShe paused, studying the ballast earth. \"Can you cast the full spell? Standard Terra Form should raise earth two to four feet with proper Mana channeling.\"\n\nThe question hung there. I looked at the two-inch mound I'd raised.\n\n\"This is the full spell,\" I said. \"Two, maybe three inches. That's all I can manage.\"\n\n\"I haven't crystallized Mana yet,\" I added, defensive. \"Forty-five Mi means I'm at the Om Point, but...\" I trailed off. The excuse felt hollow even as I said it.\n\n\"Is that why the output's so small?\" Gustin asked, looking at the woman. \"Because he hasn't crystallized yet?\"\n\nThe woman's expression shifted—not quite sympathy, but understanding. \"Partly, yes. Without crystallization, you're channeling Urja directly, converting it to Mana in real-time. No reservoir to draw from. Crystallization should provide some storage, yes. Whether that's enough to improve output significantly at 45 Mi...\" She paused, considering. \"That depends on your natural equilibrium.\" She tucked her journal away. \"But the speed is still revolutionary. The mechanism contradicts everything I know about spell arrays. If you can demonstrate this at an academy, they'll want to study it.\" She met my eyes. \"Whether it's enough to overcome other concerns, I can't say.\"\n\nRevolutionary casting speed. Two-inch earth rises. Academia Midur would care about the first until they saw the second. Then they'd care about neither. Very impressive. Very \"congratulations on optimizing a parlor trick.\" What good was optimization if I couldn't move enough earth to matter?\n\nBut Gustin was nodding, thoughtful. \"For combat casting? For quick defensive maneuvers or creating terrain advantages? Instant Terra Form is better than any four-second version. Even if it's only two inches, you can place it exactly when you need it.\"\n\n\"It's a start,\" he added, gripping my shoulder. \"And it's more than most people show up with.\"\n\nThe deck lurched beneath us. Gustin and I both staggered, the moment breaking.\n\nThe woman looked at me directly. \"How did you learn this?\"\n\n\"Sword instructor. He made me practice casting while moving.\"\n\nShe made a note. \"For combat application?\"\n\n\"He said magic in a real fight doesn't wait for you to stand still.\"\n\n\"That's...\" She paused, considering. \"Unconventional. Academies separate combat training from casting entirely.\" She glanced at her notes, then back at me. \"I don't understand what you're doing.\" She extended a hand. \"Yara. Researcher. Hired on for the voyage by Hunters.\"\n\n\"Marcus.\" I shook her hand. \"This is Gustin.\"\n\n\"I gathered.\" She gestured at her journal. \"Fifteen years studying spell mechanics. This doesn't fit any model I know.\" She paused, tapping her pencil against the page. \"But it clearly works. When you get to Mali—if they let you demonstrate this for the academy researchers—do it. It's worth studying.\"\n\n\"If they let me demonstrate,\" I repeated. The words hung heavy. \"That's the problem, isn't it? They have to let me in the door first.\"\n\nYara's expression shifted—sympathy, maybe. Or recognition. \"Right. The Mi threshold.\" She hesitated. \"I can't promise they'll be reasonable about that.\"\n\n\"Nobody has been yet.\" At least I was collecting data points. Very thorough of me.\n\nShe didn't argue. Just tucked her journal away, shifted the staff back to her hand, and walked off, still frowning at her notes.\n\nFootsteps approached from amidships—measured, deliberate. I turned. A woman in a captain's coat stood a few paces away, arms crossed, gray-streaked hair pulled back in a tight braid. She looked at the ballast earth scattered across the deck, then at me.\n\n\"Done playing with my ship's ballast?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. Sorry.\"\n\n\"Better be.\" She walked over, examined the displaced ballast earth. \"Fix this back to pristine condition, or I'll have ya both thrown overboard. Ballast weight keeps my ship stable—I won't have passengers messin' with it.\"\n\nI looked at the ballast pile. The two demonstrations had left earth slightly raised and unsettled, disrupting the carefully distributed weight.\n\n\"I can fix it.\"\n\n\"See that ya do. Now.\" She didn't move, just watched.\n\nI went through both affected areas methodically, using Terra Form to smooth the raised sections back down, packing the earth level with the rest of the ballast. The captain inspected each spot with her boot, testing for proper compaction.\n\n\"Acceptable.\" She gave me a hard look. \"No more messin' with ship's ballast. Practice yer magic somewhere that won't cost me stability.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nShe walked off without another word.\n\nThe First Mate, still watching from her rigging work, gave a low chuckle. \"Don't take it personal, lad. Captain's just protective of her record—twenty years without losin' a ship or crew. Ballast shifts wrong, whole vessel goes belly-up.\" She coiled her rope with practiced efficiency. \"But that trick of yours? Packin' earth back down in seconds? That's useful. Crew takes half an hour with shovels to do what ya just did.\"\n\nShe went back to her work. I found myself standing straighter. Gustin and I stepped aside as crew resumed their tasks, giving them space around the ballast.\n\nI stood there, unsure how to process that. A Hunter who recognized my Kata. A First Mate who saw practical value in two-inch earth manipulation. A researcher baffled by impossible casting speed.\n\nMaybe I'd been measuring the wrong thing. Power mattered to academies. But out here, useful mattered more.\n\nGustin was grinning at me. \"See? Not everyone judges by Mi value.\"\n\n~~~\n\nThe next day and a half passed in the rhythm I was starting to recognize. Morning Kata with the sailors watching. Meals at the bells. Gustin teaching me Ignite theory in our cabin while fighting his seasickness, showing me the finger choreography and mnemonic chant (Ta-se-ki) over and over until my hands knew the pattern and the syllables anchored the movements, even if I'd never channel Mana through it. The ship's endless roll. The navigator at the bow with her crystal sphere, working her detection spells with the same steady focus I'd seen that first morning.\n\nBy the fourth evening, my coin balance remained untouched at 41 gold. The ship provided meals with passage—no daily expenses beyond what I'd already burned through. Water ration, meals three times daily, shelter in a cabin the size of a storage closet. Everything accounted for. Everything paid.\n\nThat evening, after the sixth bell meal, I stayed on deck while Gustin returned to the cabin. The demonstration kept replaying. Yara's baffled investigation. Kael's recognition of something Ricardo had built into me. The First Mate's practical approval—packing earth with magic being \"useful\" in ways that had nothing to do with Mi values or academy standards.\n\nNone of them understood what I was doing. Hell, I barely understood it myself.\n\nWhich brought me back to the only two people who might have: my mother, who'd taught me the spell before she knew I'd be stuck at 45 Mi. And Ricardo, who'd challenged me to cast it while moving without realizing he was asking the impossible.\n\nThe fourth night at sea, I couldn't sleep.\n\nYara's confusion. Kael's recognition. The First Mate looking at me like I'd solved a practical problem. Five years of sword forms drilled into me. A seven-year-old's lesson in the garden before she died.\n\nAs if they'd both known I'd need this. As if they were building toward something neither of us understood yet.\n\nOur cabin was cramped, but at least it was private. I sat on my bunk while Gustin snored softly in the upper berth above me, and let myself return to the memory I'd avoided for eight years. The day she taught me Terra Form. The spring sun on dirt. Her hands guiding mine.\n\nI'd stolen from my father to be here. Left my home. And Ricardo and my mother had prepared me for this anyway.\n\nThe ship creaked. The lamp swung overhead, casting shadows that moved like wind through leaves. Like the garden in spring. Like the day she taught me.\n\nSuddenly I was seven again, kneeling in dirt under spring sun.\n\n~~~\n\nSpring. The garden behind our house. Dirt under my knees, my mother's hands guiding mine through gestures I didn't understand—slow, patient, warm. Very mystical. Very \"this will definitely work out well for the seven-year-old.\"\n\n\"This is Terra Form,\" she'd said. \"Every wizard learns it because it's useful and simple. But simple doesn't mean weak.\"\n\nThe earth had risen under her direction. Just a small mound, but it moved like water, like the soil obeyed her. I'd thought it was like how I obeyed Father in the warehouses—simple, automatic. Turns out magic required more than just following orders. Who knew?\n\n\"This will be yours,\" she'd told me, her hand on my shoulder. \"Your connection to the earth. Your magic.\"\n\nThree months later she was gone. Very considerate timing.\n\n~~~\n\nThe lamp steadied. The cabin's smell—salt, tar, close air—snapped me back. I was fifteen again, sitting in a cramped cabin with a journal full of runes I'd drawn ten thousand times.\n\nI remembered the garden after. Empty except for me and the vegetables she'd planted. Kneeling in the same dirt, hands moving through the same gestures, trying to maintain what she'd started. Pathetic, really—a seven-year-old thinking he could cast his mother back to life with perfect tomato rows.\n\nRaising tiny mounds. Helping the plants grow. Keeping something of her alive. Or at least keeping myself busy enough not to think about the alternative.\n\nI'd done that until I was ten. Every day. Every spare moment. Like if I maintained the garden perfectly, maybe she'd come back and see it. Because that's definitely how death works—impress the corpse with your gardening skills.\n\nShe never did come back. Funny how a seven-year-old thinks magic works. Keep the garden perfect, follow the rituals exactly, and the universe will notice and give you what you need. Very logical. Very \"I haven't learned that life doesn't care about your perfect vegetables yet.\"\n\nThen Ricardo had shown up.\n\n~~~\n\n\"Can you do that while moving?\"\n\nI'd looked up from the garden, dirt on my hands, confused. Ricardo stood at the garden gate watching me raise earth over and over. Because apparently that's what passed for entertainment in Conducere—watching a grieving ten-year-old play with dirt.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Cast it while you're moving. While you're doing sword forms.\"\n\nI'd stared at him. \"I've always stood still when I cast.\"\n\n\"Then try it moving.\"\n\nVery helpful. Very \"I'm definitely not going to explain why this matters.\"\n\n~~~\n\nI hadn't understood why it mattered. Hadn't seen the point of integrating magic into footwork, into combat movement, into forms I'd never use in an actual fight.\n\nRicardo had never explained. Just drilled it into me. Twice daily. Morning and evening. Five years of frustration because I couldn't see what he was building toward.\n\nI'd never know what inspired him. Maybe he'd just looked at me, saw a kid with too much anger and not enough magic, and thought: why not try something impossible? Or maybe it was simpler than that. Those old tales of warrior-mages—the ones every grandfather read to grandchildren. Heroes who were both Archmage and Sage, back when the stories didn't care about realistic Mi values.\n\nRicardo was a Qi master, not a wizard. He wouldn't have known academies said it was impossible. He'd have just thought: stories say it works, so why not try?\n\nVery Ricardo. Very \"let's see what happens if we ignore what everyone knows is true.\"\n\nHe hadn't been preparing me for combat. He'd been preparing me for the moment when I'd need every advantage I could find. For the moment when standard methods wouldn't work and I'd need something different just to survive.\n\nI opened the journal and sketched my Terra Form array from memory. Six runes instead of three. More complex than Ignite, but I'd internalized it so completely I could draw it in my sleep.\n\nAnd somewhere in that integration of movement and casting, in the ten thousand repetitions over five years with Ricardo, I'd found something that might actually matter.\n\nIf the academies would let me prove it.\n\nThe lamp swung as the ship rolled. Gustin shifted in his sleep above me.\n\nTomorrow we'd practice more. Learn more theory I couldn't use. Sail further toward an academy that would probably reject me.\n\nBut tonight, I let myself feel something I'd been avoiding.\n\nGratitude.\n\nFor my mother's last gift. For Ricardo's impossible training. For five years that had felt like punishment but might actually have been preparation.\n\nI closed the journal and lay back on my bunk.\n\nOutside the porthole, the sea stretched dark and endless.\n\nFour days at sea. Two or three weeks still ahead.\n\nMaybe that would be enough time to figure out what came next.",

            "title": "1.6 Ignite Attempts",
            "content_text": "Chapter 6 - Ignite Attempts\n\nBy the fifth day, I'd drawn the Ignite array maybe fifty times on paper and could sing Ta-se-ki in my sleep. Mastering spells I couldn't cast was becoming a specialty.\n\n\"Ready to try Ignite with actual Mana?\" Gustin asked.\n\nWe were on deck again. Same spot near the stern. The sea stretched endlessly in all directions, the northern route taking us through cold waters that smelled different than the harbor—clean and vast and slightly terrifying.\n\nGustin had brought a candle stub—ship-issue tallow—and set it on the deck rail between us.\n\n\"I've practiced the finger choreography,\" I said. \"I understand the theory.\"\n\n\"But?\"\n\n\"But I don't know if it's enough to cast it,\" I said.\n\nGustin nodded. \"Only one way to find out.\"\n\nHe walked me through the positions again. Index finger for the Heat rune. Middle finger for Direction. Ring finger for Stabilization. The pattern formed a circuit—you had to trace it in sequence, each finger drawing its rune in the air while channeling Mana through the paths.\n\n\"Start slow,\" Gustin advised. \"Focus on forming the array correctly. Don't worry about speed yet.\"\n\nI took a breath and began. Focused on the candle.\n\nIndex finger—trace the Heat rune. Vertical upward stroke, like ascending flame. Something in the movement resisted—faint, like drawing through water.\n\nMiddle finger—Direction rune. Point toward the target, guiding the heat. This one felt clearer. I'd used Direction in Terra Form for years.\n\nRing finger—Stabilization. Circle to bind the array, the same gesture from my Terra Form. This one I could draw without thinking.\n\nSix seconds. The array formed in the air in front of me—a faint shimmer, barely there unless I held perfectly still.\n\nI pushed Mana into it. The circuit completed. The Heat rune pulled—hungry, demanding—\n\nNothing happened.\n\nNo flame. No heat. Not even a warm feeling in my fingertips.\n\n\"Again,\" Gustin said. \"But this time, try to force more Mana into the Heat rune. Overload it.\"\n\nI tried again, focusing on the candle wick. Five, maybe six seconds—slightly faster as the movements became more familiar.\n\nArray formed. Mana channeled. I pushed harder into the Heat rune, trying to force the overload Gustin had described.\n\nStill nothing.\n\n\"Are you feeling any resistance?\" Gustin asked. \"Like the rune is pushing back against your Mana?\"\n\n\"Like pouring water into a bucket with no bottom.\"\n\nHe frowned. \"Try one more time. Full power. Everything you've got.\"\n\nThird attempt. I stared at the candle, focused everything I had. Five seconds to form the array—smoother now, but still twice as slow as Gustin's practiced precision. I drew every bit of Mana I could manage and shoved it into the Heat rune.\n\nThe array shimmered in the air. Perfect structure. Perfect form.\n\nThe rune pulled. Hungry. Demanding more than I had to give.\n\nI pushed everything I could into it—every scrap of Mana I could access, forced through the circuit as hard as I could manage. The Heat rune kept pulling, straining, trying to reach some threshold I couldn't provide.\n\nThe array shuddered. The Heat rune flickered, sputtered—for a split second it almost cascaded into something, almost triggered—\n\nThen everything fragmented. The structure collapsed. Mana scattered into nothing.\n\nNo flame. No heat. The candle wick remained dark and cold. Just failure.\n\nThree attempts. Perfect array formation every time. Zero thermal output. I was achieving consistency in my incompetence. Very impressive.\n\nI let my hands drop. \"Nothing.\"\n\nGustin studied the empty air where the array had been. \"The structure was perfect. I could see it form—all three runes manifested cleanly. But the Heat rune never reached overload.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Hold on.\" He disappeared below deck, returned a minute later with a worn journal—the kind with pages that had been referenced too many times. \"These are my notes from old mage Corvin back in Planus. Never needed to look at the technical specs before, but...\"\n\nHe flipped through pages, found what he was looking for.\n\n\"Watch.\"\n\nHe formed his Ignite array. Three seconds, practiced precision. Channeled Mana through the circuit—\n\nThe candle wick burst into flame.\n\nI watched it burn. So simple for him. Just another spell, barely worth thinking about.\n\n\"That's what it should do,\" Gustin said, releasing the array. \"Thermal overload at the target point. Enough heat to cause ignition.\"\n\nGustin had conjured a flame in three seconds. I'd spent ten minutes forming perfect arrays that did nothing. The distance between what he could do and what I couldn't felt wider than the entire northern sea.\n\n\"So why can't I do it?\"\n\nHe consulted his notes. \"Ignite needs two things. Four hundred M of stored Mana to feed the Heat rune.\" He traced down the page. \"And forty Mi of channeling capacity to push it through hard enough to create the overload.\"\n\n\"I tested at forty-five Mi.\"\n\n\"That's your Mi value—blood Urja density.\" He tapped his chest. \"But channeling capacity is different. How much you can actually push through a spell array at once.\"\n\nI thought about that desperate straining. The way the Heat rune had pulled and pulled but I couldn't force enough through. \"They're not the same thing.\"\n\n\"No. Institutes measure Mi value—tells them if you can crystallize Mana in your heart. But it doesn't measure how hard you can channel during actual casting.\" He looked at his notes again. \"When you tried, how did it feel?\"\n\n\"Like trying to move cargo through a door that's just slightly too narrow. No matter how hard I push, the door won't budge.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"The Heat rune needs forty Mi channeling intensity to trigger overload. Below that threshold...\" He gestured at my failed attempt. \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"And I probably don't have four hundred M stored anyway.\"\n\n\"You don't have any stored.\" He said it matter-of-factly. \"You haven't crystallized Mana yet. Right at forty-five Mi...\" He consulted his notes. \"Corvin wrote that people at the Om Point can convert Urja to Mana when they cast, but it doesn't crystallize. No storage. You're making Mana in real-time and using it immediately.\"\n\n\"So I'll never have enough for Ignite.\"\n\n\"Not until you crystallize, no. And that...\" He trailed off, uncomfortable.\n\nAnd that required being above the Om Point. Or somehow getting my Mi value to rise, which I had no idea how to do. Or waiting and hoping for natural crystallization that might never happen at exactly forty-five Mi.\n\nTwo failures. No storage. Can't push hard enough.\n\nPerfect array structure. Zero output.\n\nI stared at my hands. Five seconds to form a perfect Ignite array—faster than most beginners could manage after just days of practice. Technical progress that should matter. And zero output because I couldn't meet the threshold requirements.\n\nMy father would be proud of my business sense—paying for ship passage to learn spells I couldn't actually use.\n\nThe academies had judged me insufficient. Was this proof they were right? Perfect structure meant nothing without the capacity to execute. But then why test array formation at all? Why not just measure Mi values and send everyone home? Maybe they didn't know either. Maybe they were just as confused by edge cases like me. Technically qualified. Completely ineffective.\n\n\"Teach me anyway,\" I said after a moment.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You said you'd teach me Ignite and Barrier theory. I can't cast Ignite, but I want to know it. Want to understand how it works.\" I met his eyes. \"Maybe someday I'll figure out how to make it work for someone like me. Or at least I'll be able to explain what I'm missing with impressive technical accuracy.\"\n\nGustin studied me for a long moment. Then nodded. \"Alright. Let's keep going. You've learned the array and the basic mechanics. Now let me teach you the variations—I mean, what I know of them.\"\n\nAnd he did. For the next hour, he walked me through everything he knew about Ignite. How to adjust the Direction rune to spread heat across an area instead of focusing it at a point. How some mages modified the Stabilization rune to maintain heat for longer—at the cost of higher Mana consumption, Corvin said. How the chant, while not strictly necessary, helped coordinate the finger movements and build muscle memory for consistent array formation.\n\nI took notes in my journal. Filled three pages with annotations and diagrams and theoretical variations I'd probably never cast.\n\nBut I learned it. Understood it. Could explain it to someone else if I needed to.\n\nThis story is posted elsewhere by the author. Help them out by reading the authentic version.\n\nAnd if nothing else, at least I'd know what I was missing.\n\nEighteen gold for a cabin to learn spells I couldn't cast. Forty gold, nine silver, ten copper remaining. Every expense I hadn't anticipated cutting into funds I'd need for Mali.\n\nFather would call it throwing money at pride. He'd probably be right.\n\n~~~\n\nWe returned to the cabin as the sixth bell rang. Gustin collapsed on his bunk, exhausted from fighting seasickness and teaching simultaneously. I spent the evening reviewing my notes, filling pages with arrays I might never cast.\n\nThe sixth day passed in similar rhythm—morning practice on deck, failed Ignite attempts, Gustin's patient instruction filling the gaps where my capacity fell short. The weather stayed cold as we crossed Frost Bay and crested around Vallis's northern coast. The ship turned south, hugging the shoreline as we left the coldest waters behind. Still cold—this was northern Vallis—but the navigator said we'd see warmer weather within a week.\n\nAll stone and timber buildings hunched against the perpetual wind. No trees. No color. Just functional architecture designed to survive, not to inspire.\n\n\"Cheerful place,\" Gustin muttered as we descended the gangplank. His breath fogged in the cold air.\n\n\"I think it's designed to make sailors appreciate being at sea.\"\n\n\"It's working.\"\n\nThe port was small—maybe six buildings total clustered around a sheltered harbor that barely qualified as protection from the northern winds. A tavern. A supply house. A harbormaster's shack. And three buildings whose purposes I couldn't immediately identify but assumed involved fish, salt, or both.\n\n\"Six hours, ya got,\" the First Mate had announced. \"Resupply stop. Be back 'fore the evenin' bell or we sail without ya.\"\n\nSix hours in Saltcrest. The highlight of our voyage so far.\n\nGustin and I found the tavern—optimistically named \"The Warm Harbor\"—and discovered it was neither particularly warm nor reminiscent of any harbor I'd want to visit.\n\nBut it had spiced cider.\n\n\"Two copper,\" the proprietor said, eyeing us with the universal skepticism tavern owners reserve for young travelers. \"Each.\"\n\nI handed over four copper coins. Not much, but every coin mattered now. Forty gold, nine silver, six copper remaining—dwindling faster than I'd planned.\n\nThe cider arrived in wooden mugs that looked older than the building. It was hot, heavily spiced with what I suspected was mostly cinnamon and hope, and tasted like someone had dissolved a candle in apple juice.\n\n\"This is terrible,\" Gustin said after his first sip.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Why are we still drinking it?\"\n\n\"Because it's hot and we've been cold for three days.\"\n\n\"Fair point.\"\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, letting the warmth seep into our hands. The tavern was mostly empty—a few weathered sailors at one table, a merchant who looked like he'd made poor life choices, and a woman in the corner who might have been asleep or dead. Hard to tell.\n\n\"You know what I miss?\" Gustin said suddenly. \"Real food. Not ship rations. Not whatever this is.\" He gestured at his cider. \"Just... normal food that doesn't taste like it's been preserved in salt for six months.\"\n\n\"Catherine's meat pies,\" I said without thinking. \"She makes them with this gravy that's—\" I stopped. My chest tightened. Talking about home risked making it real.\n\n\"Sounds good.\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\nAnother silence. The kind that's comfortable because you're both too cold and tired to fill it with meaningless words.\n\n\"Want to test your Terra Form on unfamiliar terrain?\" Gustin asked eventually. \"Scientific curiosity.\"\n\n\"You mean you want to see if it works on ice and frozen rock.\"\n\n\"That's what I said. Scientific curiosity.\"\n\nWe finished our terrible cider and went outside.\n\nThe cold hit immediately—sharp northern wind that cut through my cloak like it wasn't there. We found a relatively sheltered spot behind the supply house, out of sight of casual observers.\n\n\"Alright,\" Gustin said, wrapping his arms around himself. \"Show me.\"\n\nI looked at the ground. Rocky earth, patches of ice, nothing that looked particularly cooperative.\n\nSettled my feet, testing the unstable ground beneath. The movement flowed through me—Ricardo's training automatic even on ice. My weight shifted, and the array followed.\n\nThe rock rippled. Barely an inch and a half—less than usual on the harder substrate. But it moved.\n\n\"Works on ice-covered northern rock,\" Gustin confirmed, shivering. \"Very scientific. Can we get back to the ship now before we freeze?\"\n\nWe headed back to the ship as the evening bell rang. Once aboard, I ran through Wind-Cutting Form twice, shaking off Saltcrest's gray mood. The discipline helped. Ricardo had always said practice steadied the mind when results disappointed.\n\nThe deck was crowded with passengers taking evening air. I'd found a clear space near the stern, away from the merchant groups clustered amidships. The northern wind had softened as we turned south, but I needed movement more than warmth.\n\nThen something small and furry darted between my feet.\n\nI stumbled mid-strike, barely catching my balance. The claymore's sheathed tip hit the deck with a thunk. Very graceful. Ricardo would be so proud.\n\nThe creature stopped a few feet away. A fox sat there, looking entirely too pleased with itself. Russet-red fur with ember-orange highlights, bright amber eyes, tail swishing like it had just won a game I hadn't known we were playing.\n\n\"What—\" I started.\n\nThe fox pounced forward, grabbed the leather cord wrapped around my claymore's sheath in its teeth, and pulled.\n\n\"Hey!\" I tugged back gently, trying not to actually hurt the thing. \"That's not a toy.\"\n\nThe fox made a sound somewhere between a yip and a laugh—if foxes could laugh—and yanked harder. Its tail was wagging with the kind of shameless enthusiasm I'd stopped allowing myself years ago. Apparently foxes didn't need high Mi values to enjoy life.\n\n\"Ash!\" A woman's voice called from across the deck. \"Ash, get back here!\"\n\nThe auburn-haired Hunter from Kael's team appeared, jogging over with an expression caught between exasperation and amusement. She reached us, slightly out of breath, and scooped up the fox, who released my sword cord with obvious reluctance.\n\n\"I am so sorry,\" she said, tucking the squirming fox under one arm. \"She's been cooped up in our cabin for days and apparently decided you looked like entertainment.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\" My mouth twitched upward despite my best efforts to maintain grim determination. The fox was staring at me with those bright eyes, tongue lolling out like this was the best game ever. \"She's got good instincts. I was getting too serious about the form anyway.\"\n\n\"That's generous of you.\" The woman shifted the fox to a more secure hold. Ash immediately tried to climb onto her shoulder. \"I'm Senna. Beast specialist with Kael's team. This troublemaker is Ash.\"\n\n\"Marcus.\" I used the strap to shift the claymore to my back, out of fox reach. \"She's your partner?\"\n\n\"For three years now. Red fox, fire-affinity. She's better at tracking than most Hunters twice her size.\" Senna scratched behind Ash's ears. The fox leaned into it, making a soft cooing sound. \"Also better at causing mischief, apparently. She's usually more professional than this.\"\n\nAsh yipped and tried to jump toward me again. Senna held her back with practiced ease.\n\n\"Fire-affinity?\" I hadn't heard the term before.\n\n\"Some develop elemental attunements. Ash can generate small flames, track heat signatures, resist cold better than normal foxes.\" She smiled at my interest. \"Not all Beasts are dangerous. Some are just... different. Magical.\"\n\nGustin had emerged from below deck during the conversation, leaning against the rail a few paces away. His shoulders were rigid at first—the usual wariness around Beasts—but he leaned forward when Ash yipped.\n\n\"How does a Beast develop magic?\" The question came before I could stop myself. \"I thought only beings above Om Point could crystallize Mana.\"\n\n\"Different biology entirely. Beasts don't work like we do—they're born with cores, or develop them naturally as they grow. Different species, different rules.\" She tilted her head. \"You ask good questions. Most people just want to know if Ash bites.\"\n\n\"Does she?\"\n\n\"Only people who deserve it.\"\n\nI laughed. The sound felt foreign after days of grim practice and perfect failures. \"What kind of Beasts does your team hunt?\"\n\n\"We don't hunt—we retrieve. Specific specimens for research institutions, usually alive.\" Senna scratched behind Ash's ears. \"Though most of our contracts aren't as dramatic as Ash makes them sound.\"\n\nAsh yipped indignantly.\n\n\"Senna.\" Yara's voice came from behind me. I turned to see the researcher approaching, staff in hand. She nodded to me, then Gustin. \"Evening feeding time. The specimen's getting restless.\"\n\n\"Already?\" Senna shifted Ash to her shoulder. \"Alright, I'm coming.\"\n\n\"Wait—you have a specimen aboard?\" Gustin asked, glancing between them. \"What kind?\"\n\nSenna glanced at Yara, something amused in her expression. \"Frost Marten from the Snow Isles. Rare ice-affinity. We've been caring for it for three months.\"\n\nA rare ice-affinity Beast. I couldn't help myself. \"Could we see it?\"\n\nYara studied us for a moment, then looked at Senna. Senna shrugged. \"They asked good questions earlier. And Marcus isn't easily spooked.\"\n\n\"You're not squeamish?\" Yara asked.\n\n\"I've gutted fish,\" I said.\n\n\"Not quite the same.\" Yara's expression softened slightly. \"But close enough. Come on. Just don't touch anything, and if it gets stressed, you leave immediately.\"\n\nShe led the way to a hatchway amidships. Senna followed with Ash, and Gustin trailed after us, curiosity overcoming his usual caution around Beasts. We descended the narrow ladder into the cargo hold's dimness, the smell of tar and stored goods replacing the salt air.\n\nCrates secured with heavy netting filled most of the hold—standard warehouse practice, the kind my father's crews used for fragile goods. The hanging lamps swayed with the ship's movement, casting shifting shadows. Transporting live specimens apparently required the same logistics as expensive glassware. Very comforting.\n\nIn the far corner sat the cage—maybe four feet on each side, reinforced iron with intricate engravings. Cold-dampening runes—similar to the preservation arrays in Father's warehouse, but more sophisticated. My father's cargo security looked amateur by comparison. Very reassuring that keeping this creature calm required more magical engineering than my father's entire warehouse security. Inside, a silver-white creature lay curled on what looked like a bed of frost.\n\n\"That's Silver,\" Senna said quietly, her whole demeanor shifting to something gentler. \"Official designation: Frost Marten, specimen one.\"\n\nAsh immediately hopped down from Senna's shoulder and padded around the cage with exaggerated confidence—chest puffed, steps high and deliberate. Small sparks flickered along her tail as she circled, like she was putting on a show. She sat down primly at the front, her tail tip glowing faintly orange, and looked back at us as if to say See? I found this one.\n\nThe Frost Marten cracked one eye open, looked at Ash with profound disinterest, and closed it again.\n\nAsh huffed—an actual huffy sound—and strutted back toward Senna with wounded dignity.\n\nI laughed despite everything. Apparently it took an indignant fox to remind me how.\n\n\"She tracked him for three weeks through northern forests,\" Senna explained, scooping up her indignant partner. \"Fire-affinity foxes detect temperature—she followed where the heat wasn't. Every feeding, same routine. He ignores her every time.\"\n\nThe Beast was beautiful. Sleek mustelid body, maybe the size of a large cat, with fur that shimmered in the lamplight. Frost patterns traced along its spine—crystalline blue-white markings that caught the light.\n\nAn ice weasel in a reinforced cage. Very relevant to my inability to light candles. My education was progressing exactly as planned.\n\nYara moved to a bucket of seawater near the cage, setting her staff within arm's reach as she knelt. Her fingers began moving through precise gestures—tracing a runic array in the air above the water. I recognized Direction and Concentration from Gustin's teaching. The array formed in maybe three seconds, then Yara channeled Mana through it, maintaining the flow. Ice crystals spread outward from beneath her palm. \"Keeps him calm during transport. Weeks at sea would stress any Beast from frozen environments.\"\n\nWeeks of ice generation for the entire voyage. My eighteen gold for cabin passage suddenly seemed reasonable—at least I wasn't responsible for keeping an ice weasel comfortable in northern summer.\n\nShe lifted the ice block—maybe twenty pounds—and slid it through a gap in the cage bars. It landed near the Frost Marten with a soft thump. The Beast stirred slightly, shifted closer to the cold, then settled again.\n\n\"He's very calm,\" I said, watching the creature's slow, lethargic movements. \"Considering he's in a cage.\"\n\nYara stood, dusting off her hands. \"Alchemical sedative. Dosage adjusted for body weight—too much damages the specimen, too little and it's stressed.\" She nodded toward Senna. \"She monitors him closely. Morning and evening feeding with sedative mixed in the food.\"\n\nSenna pulled frozen fish from a pouch, slid it through the cage bars. The Frost Marten stirred, took it with careful movements, ate slowly.\n\nThe precision reminded me of my father's warehouse managers—same meticulous tracking, same schedule discipline. Different cargo, same logistics. Though I doubted my father's fish shipments required weeks of twice-daily ice generation.\n\nI crouched near the cage, examining the frost patterns along the Frost Marten's spine. They were beautiful—natural crystalline structures that seemed almost deliberately artistic. \"Those markings. Do they mean something?\"\n\n\"That's what we're trying to figure out.\" Yara pulled out her journal, flipped to a sketch of the patterns. \"They appeared naturally—not injury scars or artificial marks. I suspect they indicate core location. Some Beasts crystallize along their spines instead of internally. If this specimen is one of them...\" She trailed off, clearly excited. \"It would validate alternate core structure theories.\"\n\n\"Beasts can have cores in different locations?\" Gustin asked.\n\n\"Different species, different biology.\" Yara gestured at the Frost Marten. \"Sentient races crystallize in hearts because that's where our Urja circulation converges. But Beasts—their biology is completely different. Cores can form in hearts, heads, along spines, even in limbs for some species.\"\n\nDifferent biology, different rules. Very flexible. Apparently the universe reserved all its structural creativity for Beasts and left sentient races with 'heart or nothing.'\n\nI stared at the frost patterns. At the way they traced the spine in deliberate lines.\n\nCores didn't have to be in hearts. Different biology allowed different structures.\n\nI filed that thought away, not sure what to do with it yet.\n\n\"Thanks for showing us,\" I said to Senna.\n\n\"You're welcome. Just... don't mention it to other passengers. Most people get nervous about Beasts on ships.\" She smiled. \"Even sedated ones.\"\n\nWe climbed back up to the deck, leaving the Frost Marten to its cold, sedated rest.\n\nSomewhere in that hold, a Beast was crystallizing Mana along its spine instead of its heart. Different biology. Different location. Same function.\n\nI didn't have answers yet. But I had observations.\n\nAnd maybe that was enough to start with.",

            "title": "1.7 Warmer Waters",
            "content_text": "\"So, about Barrier,\" Gustin said on the eighth day. We were back in our cabin, papers spread on the lower bunk between us. The ship had found warmer waters, making the cramped space almost comfortable.\n\nI looked up from my journal. Two days of practicing Ignite variations I couldn't actually cast. My enthusiasm for theoretical knowledge was wearing thin.\n\n\"It should work for you,\" he continued. \"Unlike Ignite.\"\n\n\"Because I have so much success with spells.\"\n\n\"No, I mean—Barrier's different. Ignite is an overload spell. It needs to hit that threshold or it doesn't trigger at all. All-or-nothing.\" He pulled out his notes. \"But Barrier is a channeled spell. Like your Terra Form.\"\n\nI waited.\n\n\"With Terra Form, you're feeding Mana into the array continuously, right? Maintaining the effect as long as you channel. There's no threshold to hit, no overload to trigger.\" He gestured at the space between us. \"Barrier works the same way. You channel Mana through the array to maintain the shield. Even a little Mana should produce something.\"\n\n\"Something small.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Like your Terra Form—smaller effect, but functional.\" He shrugged. \"Two-inch earth rises. Maybe a smaller shield. Not impressive, but better than nothing.\"\n\nBetter than nothing. My new standard for success.\n\n\"Alright,\" I said. \"Teach me.\"\n\n\"It's going to be more complex,\" he warned. \"Fifteen to eighteen runes depending on which academy variant you learn.\"\n\nI stared at him. \"That's three times Terra Form's size.\"\n\n\"Yeah. It's why most academies don't teach it first year.\"\n\n\"Perfect. I can barely cast the simple spell. Let's learn the complicated one.\" I pulled paper toward me. \"What could go wrong?\"\n\nHe pulled out his spellbook, flipping to a page dense with runic diagrams. \"But everyone learns it eventually. And if you're going to understand how complex spell construction works, Barrier is, like, a perfect example. It has everything—force generation, shape definition, duration management, feedback loops.\"\n\n\"I thought you said you didn't understand the theory behind your spells.\"\n\n\"I don't understand why specific runes create specific effects. But I can teach you the structure, how the runes connect, what each section does functionally. I mean, that's what Corvin taught me.\" He tapped the diagram. \"Chief Aldric brought Academia Midur's methods back to Arvum. Taught Corvin the finer points, Corvin taught me. I'm teaching you. It's the same pattern they've been using for a thousand years.\"\n\nI pulled the paper closer, studying the array. It was beautiful in its complexity—four distinct sections arranged in a geometric pattern, each section containing multiple runes that fed into the next.\n\n\"How do you even memorize this?\"\n\n\"Section by section. Nobody learns the whole thing at once.\" He grabbed a blank sheet and started sketching. \"Section One is, uh, Force generation. This is where you create the actual barrier energy—the thing that stops physical objects.\"\n\nHe drew three runes: Force, Amplification, Anchor.\n\n\"Okay, so—Force creates the base energy,\" he explained. \"But Corvin said Force alone is weak. Barely stops a thrown stone. So you add Amplification, which, uh, multiplies the Force output. Then Anchor—that defines where the barrier exists. Usually attached to your left arm, so it moves with you naturally.\"\n\nI copied the three runes into my journal. At this rate I'd master the theory of every spell by age thirty. Actually casting them remained optional. \"So this section creates amplified Force energy at a specific location.\"\n\n\"Right. But Force without structure is just, like, energy floating in space. It'll dissipate in seconds. I mean, that's what Section Two fixes—Shape definition.\"\n\nHe drew the next section: Concentration, Duration, Stabilization, Boundary.\n\n\"Concentration focuses the Force into one area instead of spreading it everywhere—defines the barrier's size and edges. Duration determines how long the Force maintains cohesion. Stabilization you already know from Terra Form—locks everything in place. And Boundary...\" He tapped the fourth rune. \"That's a marker that tells the array where the barrier's edges are. Works with Concentration to define the exact dimensions.\"\n\n\"That's seven runes already. What's next?\"\n\n\"Section Three—Pressure Maintenance.\" He drew three more runes: Channeling, Feedback, Terminus. \"This is where it gets interesting. Channeling creates the pathway for continuous Mana flow—how you feed power into the barrier. Terminus is the failsafe, lets you release the spell cleanly when you're done. And Feedback...\" He paused, tapping the rune. \"Feedback is what makes it a barrier instead of just a floating Force plane. It tells the array to resist physical impact. The harder something pushes against the barrier, the more the Force pushes back. I mean, that's how Corvin explained it.\"\n\n\"That's...\" I stared at the runes. \"That's actually genius. It's self-regulating.\"\n\n\"To a point. The Feedback rune helps the barrier resist impact efficiently—pushes back proportional to what hits it. But your initial Mana determines the size, and how much you channel determines strength.\" He tapped the Anchor rune from Section One. \"And this matters more than people think. Anchor it to your arm, you get mobility—barrier moves with you. But the force still transfers. A charging bull might not break the barrier, but it'll shatter your arm behind it.\"\n\n\"So for heavy impacts...\"\n\n\"Anchor to ground. Or a wall. Something that can absorb the force instead of your bones.\" He shrugged. \"I learned to always check my footing before casting. Corvin made me practice both ways until it was instinct.\"\n\n\"What's Section Four?\"\n\n\"Resistance Properties.\" He drew three runes: Enhancement, Resonance, Isolation. \"Enhancement makes the barrier more efficient—more resistance per Mana spent. Resonance harmonizes the array with your personal Mana signature, so it feels natural to maintain. And Isolation prevents external Mana from interfering with the structure.\"\n\nHe added two final runes. \"And these connect everything—Storage holds reserve Mana for the array, Release controls how it all dissipates when you're done. Without them, the barrier either drains you dry or collapses messily. At least, that's what Corvin's notes said.\"\n\nI looked at all fifteen runes spread across my paper. Gorgeous. Complex. Completely theoretical for someone who couldn't push enough Mana through a three-rune array. \"This is insane. How do you keep track of all of them while casting?\"\n\n\"Practice. Lots and lots of practice.\" He pulled out another sheet. \"Okay, so here's the trick—you don't think about individual runes once you've learned them. They become one complete pattern. Like...\" He gestured vaguely. \"Like your sword forms, probably. You don't consciously move each piece—you just do the form and your body remembers the sequence.\"\n\nThat made sense. Ricardo had drilled forms into me until they were automatic. Until I could execute complex attack patterns while exhausted, injured, distracted.\n\n\"How long did it take you to learn Barrier?\"\n\n\"Three months. And I still cast it slowly—takes me about seven seconds on a good day.\" He smiled ruefully, but I caught something else in his expression—uncertainty. \"Old man Corvin said that's normal for someone at forty-eight Mi. The more Mana you have, the easier it is to maintain the whole array while channeling. I mean, that's the theory anyway.\"\n\nThe author's content has been appropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.\n\nHe hesitated, then: \"To be honest, I'm not even sure I should be teaching you this. What if I'm explaining it wrong? Corvin taught me, but he admitted he didn't fully understand the advanced theory either. And now I'm passing that incomplete knowledge to you, acting like I know what I'm doing when...\" He trailed off. \"When I'm barely competent myself.\"\n\nGustin was teaching me to build shields I'd never raise. And he worried about being qualified. We were a matched set of inadequacy.\n\n\"You can cast it. That's more than I can do.\"\n\n\"Barely. Seven seconds is slow. Academy students probably do it in four or five. I'm teaching you something I haven't even mastered.\" He looked down at the spellbook. \"Sometimes I wonder if I'm qualified to teach anyone anything.\"\n\n\"So at forty-five Mi...\"\n\n\"You'll probably find it harder, yeah. But the point isn't to cast it perfectly right now. The point is to understand the structure.\" He tapped the paper. \"Start memorizing Section One. Three runes. Get the shapes right, the proportions, how they connect. Tomorrow I'll teach you the finger choreography for actually drawing them.\"\n\nI spent that evening—after my Kata practice on deck—and the next morning drawing Force, Amplification, Anchor over and over. The runes became familiar. Not automatic like Terra Form, but recognizable. Shapes I could reproduce without reference.\n\nOver the next two days, Gustin quizzed me at meals, made me draw each rune from memory, checking my proportions against his spellbook.\n\n\"Good,\" he said finally on the morning of the tenth day. \"That's Section One down. Three more to go.\"\n\n\"This is going to take the entire voyage, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Probably. But hey—by the time we dock at Navale, you'll know two academy-standard spells. Even if you can't cast one of them and can barely cast the other, you'll understand the theory.\" He grinned. \"That's first-year curriculum condensed into a few weeks at sea. Not bad.\"\n\nNot bad. If I ignored the part where I'd probably never actually use any of it.\n\n~~~\n\nEarly morning on the ninth day, I finished my Kata practice on deck.\n\nThe navigator stood at the bow with her weathered hands on a crystal sphere mounted to the railing, eyes closed, muttering something too quiet to hear. Her Dwarf features showed maybe two centuries of experience—all of it etched into the lines around her eyes.\n\n\"Sensing currents,\" the First Mate explained when I asked. \"Water flows, wind patterns, upcoming weather. Good navigator can feel disturbances hours before they arrive. Keeps us on course and out of trouble.\"\n\n\"How does it work?\"\n\n\"Detect Magic spell, but specialized. Thora's sensing changes in ambient Urja—how the sea moves, how the wind carries it. Takes years to learn the subtleties.\" She shrugged. \"That's why navigators earn triple what normal crew does.\"\n\nShe worked for an hour. Subtle stance adjustments, course corrections called to the helmsman. The crystal sphere glowed faintly when she channeled Mana—something incredibly complex, made routine.\n\n\"Been sailing these waters two hundred years,\" Thora said without opening her eyes, somehow sensing my stare. \"Still learn something new every voyage. That's why I'm still alive.\"\n\nTwo hundred years perfecting one skill. I couldn't even perfect one spell in eight days. The efficiency gap was impressive.\n\nAnd I had one spell I could cast in less than a second, one spell I could form perfectly but not produce any effect, and one spell I could barely manifest as an eight-inch shimmer.\n\nThe gap between us was enormous. At least I was consistent in my limitations.\n\nBut maybe, if I was very lucky and very stubborn and didn't die trying, I could find some path forward.\n\nEven if I didn't know what that path was yet.\n\n~~~\n\nEarly evening on the tenth day, I was on deck finishing my evening Kata practice. The crew moved differently.\n\nNot rushing. Not panicking. But purposeful. Urgent. The kind of movement that suggested they knew something I didn't.\n\nThe navigator—Thora Deepcurrent—was in deep conversation with Captain Ross near the helm. Both looking west toward the horizon where Vallis coastline ran. Thora's weathered hands moved in patterns I couldn't read, her centuries of experience visible in every gesture.\n\n\"Storm comin',\" one of the sailors said as he hurried past with extra rope coiled over his shoulder. \"Big one.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" I asked, looking at the sky. It was clear. Calm. The kind of evening that suggested nothing but peaceful sailing ahead.\n\n\"Navigator felt it. She's good—can sense disturbances half a day before they hit.\" He jerked his thumb toward Captain Ross. \"Ross is movin' us away from the coast. Don't want to be near rocks when it arrives.\"\n\nI looked toward the western horizon. We'd been hugging the Vallis coastline for days, keeping land visible on our port side for navigation. It was still there—a dark line against the evening sky. To the east lay the open Deep Sea. Endless water. Nothing but distance in every direction.\n\n\"How long do we have?\"\n\n\"Six, maybe eight hours if we're lucky. Storm's movin' fast.\" He continued past. \"Secure yer gear. It's gonna get rough.\"\n\nGustin emerged from our cabin, looking vaguely green already. \"What's happening?\"\n\n\"Storm. Big one, apparently. Navigator detected it.\"\n\n\"Of course she did.\" He gripped the rail. \"Can we just... not? Can we vote against the storm?\"\n\n\"I don't think weather takes votes.\"\n\n\"Unfortunate.\"\n\nOver the next hour, Captain Ross altered our course.\n\nThe ship angled east, putting more distance between us and the coastline. The land was still visible to port—a dark line on the western horizon—but further away than it had been all voyage. I could see the logic. In calm weather, hugging the coast meant easy navigation and nearby ports if needed. But in a storm, being close to shore meant getting driven into rocks by waves you couldn't control. Deeper water to the east meant room to maneuver. Space to ride out swells without the coastline trying to kill us.\n\nThe crew worked with practiced efficiency. Sailors secured cargo with extra lines, checking every tie-down twice. Anything loose got lashed down or brought below. Canvas was furled tight against spars. Hatches were battened. Everything that could be made safe was made safe.\n\nPassengers disappeared below deck one by one, reading signs I was only beginning to recognize. I helped where I could—which meant staying out of everyone's way.\n\n\"How bad is it going to be?\" Gustin asked a passing sailor. His voice had that forced casual quality of someone trying not to sound terrified.\n\n\"Bad enough we're preparin',\" the sailor said, not unkindly. \"But we're in deep water now. Got room to ride it out. That's what matters. Ross knows what she's doin'. Twenty years sailin', never lost a ship.\"\n\n\"Encouraging,\" Gustin muttered.\n\n\"Best you'll get.\" The sailor moved on to check rigging.\n\nI stayed on deck. The sailors moved around me—no wasted movement, no panic. Just competent people doing difficult work they'd done before. At least if we drowned, it wouldn't be from poor planning.\n\nThe wind shifted. Subtle at first, coming now from the southwest with a salt-heavy smell that tasted of distance and deep water. The waves grew incrementally—first just higher swells, then breaking crests, then walls of water that made the Dawnbreaker feel smaller than it had.\n\nThe sky darkened by degrees. Not the natural dimming of evening, but something heavier. Clouds piling on clouds, gray stacking into black, until the horizon disappeared under the weight of it. The light took on a strange green-gray quality that made everything look sickly and wrong.\n\n\"We should go below,\" Gustin said, but he didn't move. Neither did I. The storm approached with slow inevitability—violence you couldn't stop or change, only endure.\n\nThe wind picked up harder. The first drops of rain started falling—cold and hard, like the sky was throwing ice at us. Then more rain. Then sheets of it, horizontal in the wind, stinging exposed skin.\n\nAround us, the last sailors finished their work and headed below. The deck cleared except for the watch crew and Captain Ross at the helm, her hands steady on the wheel.\n\n\"We should really go below,\" Gustin said.\n\nI didn't move. \"I know.\"\n\n\"Before we drown standing up.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nBut we stayed a moment longer, watching the storm approach. Watching clouds darken and waves build and wind tear at everything loose. Watching something bigger than us, more powerful than us, utterly indifferent to whether we lived or drowned.\n\nThe ship's bell rang—three sharp notes. All hands below except essential crew.\n\n\"Come on,\" I said finally.\n\nWe went.\n\nAs we descended, I heard Captain Ross's voice cutting through the wind, calling orders to the watch. Steady. Unshaken. The kind of voice that had weathered worse than this.\n\nI wanted to believe the record would hold.\n\n~~~\n\nGustin and I made it back to our cabin just as the ship's movement got worse. The gentle roll of normal sailing had become something harder. More violent. The kind of motion that made it difficult to walk without grabbing for support.\n\n\"This is fine,\" Gustin said, white-knuckling the edge of his bunk. \"This is completely fine.\"\n\n\"You're a terrible liar.\"\n\nI secured our packs, made sure nothing loose could become a projectile when the real storm hit. My claymore was already lashed to its position against the wall. The narrow shelf was part of the wall's frame. Our bunks were built into the structure itself.\n\nThe ship lurched. Gustin made a sound I'd charitably call distressed.\n\n\"Want to go to the mess?\" I asked. \"At least there'll be other people to panic with.\"\n\n\"No. If I'm going to be sick, I'd rather do it here where I won't embarrass myself in front of the entire ship.\"\n\n\"Fair enough.\"\n\nI sat on my bunk, bracing myself against the wall as the ship rolled. Outside our tiny porthole, the waves grew. Six feet. Eight. Ten. The sky fully dark now, roiling with clouds that seemed to churn with their own inner violence.\n\nThe storm was here.\n\nAnd we were about to find out if Captain Ross's record would hold.\n\nGustin looked at me from his bunk, face pale in the swinging lamplight. \"You think we'll be alright?\"\n\n\"Twenty years. Never lost a ship.\"\n\n\"That's not comforting.\"\n\n\"It's accurate.\"\n\nHe managed a weak smile. \"If we die, at least we won't have to worry about academy rejection.\"\n\n\"That's one way to look at it.\"\n\nThe ship rolled harder. The lamp swung wildly. Outside, the wind howled like something alive and angry.\n\n\"Marcus?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Thanks. For everything. The cabin, the teaching deal, not treating me like I'm useless when I get seasick.\" He gripped his bunk as the ship lurched again. \"If we survive this, we're friends. Real friends. Not just travel companions.\"\n\n\"We're already friends, you idiot.\"\n\n\"Good.\" He closed his eyes as another wave hit. \"Just wanted to make sure you knew.\"\n\nThe storm raged outside. The ship creaked and groaned. And somewhere above us, Captain Ross held the wheel steady, guiding us through violence we couldn't control.\n\nThe record would hold. It had to.\n\nI believed it because there was no alternative.",

            "title": "1.8 Stormy Sea",
            "content_text": "Chapter 8 - Stormy Sea\n\nThe storm hit on the eleventh day at sea, just before dawn.\n\nI woke to the cabin pitching hard enough that I rolled off my bunk and hit the floor. Gustin was already awake, gripping the edge of his bunk with white knuckles.\n\n\"What's happening?\"\n\n\"Storm,\" he managed. His face had gone pale. \"Ship's rolling too much. We should—\"\n\nA crash from somewhere above. Wood splintering. Shouts.\n\n\"Stay here,\" I said, already moving toward the door.\n\n\"Marcus, don't—\"\n\nBut I was already in the corridor, climbing the ladder to the deck. Ricardo's training: understand the threat before it understands you.\n\nI stumbled onto deck into chaos.\n\nRain lashed horizontally. Wind tore at anything loose. Sailors shouted orders—mouths moving, words lost in the roar of water and thunder. And the ship—the Dawnbreaker, which had seemed so solid in Portare's calm harbor—rolled like a toy in a bathtub.\n\nThe crew worked with grim efficiency despite the chaos. Near the bow, three men fought to secure a loose spar that swung wildly with each wave. Amidships, others pulled on lines, their movements coordinated by shouts I couldn't hear over the wind. Father's warehouse managers moved like that during cargo emergencies. No wasted motion. Every hand knowing its job.\n\nThe hold hatch banged open. Kael emerged first, the Hunter team's leader taking in the deck with a single sharp glance. Behind him came the Dwarf—stocky, bearded, built like a boulder with legs. Kael pointed toward the mainmast, shouted something to the Dwarf, and they split—Kael moving to coordinate with the crew, the Dwarf heading to anchor a cargo net that three sailors couldn't hold steady.\n\nNear the port side, three crewmen were fighting with heavy netting that covered crates the size of wardrobes. One of them spotted me standing there.\n\n\"You! Help us with this! Move!\"\n\nI ran—or tried to. The deck pitched. I grabbed a line to steady myself, made it to where they struggled.\n\n\"Pull!\" the lead sailor shouted. \"Together! Now!\"\n\nI grabbed the rope where indicated. Soaked hemp, heavier than it had any right to be, fibers rough enough to tear skin. I pulled.\n\nThe crate shifted maybe an inch.\n\n\"Harder! Put yer backs into it!\"\n\nI threw my weight into it. The rope dug into my palms. The crate moved another few inches, but not enough. Not nearly enough.\n\nOne of the sailors swore. \"Ain't workin'! We need—\"\n\nI dropped the rope and pivoted, grabbing at the crate's binding instead of the securing line. This time I dug deeper—the way Ricardo had trained me to, pushing past the point where my body said stop.\n\nAnd dragged.\n\nThe cargo moved. Six inches. Then a foot. I dragged it toward the securing point while the crew stared.\n\n\"How the—?\" one started.\n\n\"Help me secure it!\" I shouted over the storm.\n\nThey moved. The four of us locked down the crate with proper netting. Then the next one. And the next. The men had stopped questioning and started pointing me wherever heavy freight needed moving.\n\nThat first stretch lasted maybe an hour. Pulling lines, wrestling cargo, securing netting with the crew who'd been doing this for years. My shoulders burned. My hands were raw. But I didn't tire—not like the sailors were tiring. Whatever Ricardo's training had built in me kept my muscles fresh, my movements fast, my balance steady even on the rolling deck.\n\nAcross the deck, the Dwarf had abandoned cargo work to help the crew secure the mainmast rigging—his strength and low center of gravity perfect for the job. A sailor slipped; the Dwarf caught him one-handed without breaking stride. No sign of the others from the Hunter team.\n\nAnd then it was back to work.\n\n~~~\n\nThe storm didn't stop. Not that day.\n\nWhen the crew I'd been working with rotated out for rest, I went with them. Nobody told me to—I just followed their pattern. Two hours below, warming up in the corridor outside our cabin, eating hardtack and drinking water that tasted of salt. Then back up when they went back up.\n\nBy evening, the worst had passed—or so we thought. The rain eased. The wind dropped enough that conversation became possible without screaming. The First Mate rotated crews, sent exhausted sailors below to sleep in shifts.\n\nDuring one of the lulls, Gustin was on deck, clinging to a mast, soaked and miserable. He'd come up on his own sometime during the day, tried to help with lighter tasks. The seasickness combined with the storm had defeated him.\n\n\"Come on,\" I said, grabbing his arm. \"Below deck. You're going to fall overboard.\"\n\n\"I'm—\" He lurched as the ship rolled. \"I'm fine.\"\n\n\"You're very green. Even for a Green. Let me help you down.\"\n\nHalf-carrying him below took effort. Got him into his bunk. Found a bucket in case he needed it.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he muttered. \"Not much use in a storm.\"\n\n\"You tried. That's what matters.\" I grabbed a relatively dry shirt from my pack. \"At least you're consistent. Your family name isn't lying.\"\n\nHe managed a weak laugh despite looking like he might die. \"I hate you.\"\n\n\"I know.\" I tossed him the shirt. \"Stay here. I'm going back up.\"\n\n\"You don't have to—\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nBut I went anyway. Because the sailors needed help and I could provide it. Simple as that.\n\n~~~\n\nThe storm came back harder the second day.\n\nDawn brought fresh waves, fresh wind, fresh chaos. Whatever had passed for calm the night before was a lie the sea had told us. I worked with the crew—four hours dragging cargo, two hours collapsed with them in the corridor, four more hours at the lines. Grim-faced and efficient, too exhausted for complaints.\n\nBy evening of the second day, the storm finally broke. The wind died. The rain became drizzle, then mist, then nothing. The deck stopped trying to throw everyone overboard.\n\nWhen I came back down, exhausted and soaked, Gustin was asleep in his bunk. I collapsed into mine without bothering to change clothes.\n\nMy muscles ached. My hands burned from rope friction. And beneath it all, a deeper exhaustion—not muscle fatigue, something else. The same hollowed-out feeling I got after Ricardo's worst training sessions, when he'd pushed me past what should have been possible. I'd recover. I always did. But for now, emptied.\n\nWe'd survived.\n\nThe crew had been counting injuries during rest periods: two sailors down—one with a broken arm from a snapped line, another with cracked ribs from being thrown against the mast. I'd been lucky. Or Ricardo's training had kept me balanced when others fell.\n\nStolen content alert: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.\n\nMy hands were torn up, blistered from hemp rope. But my arms didn't shake like the sailor beside me had. Five years of Ricardo's drills. I'd hated every one of them at the time.\n\nI should have thanked him properly. Should have told him I understood what he was trying to teach me instead of resenting every grueling session.\n\nIf I made it back to Conducere, I would.\n\n~~~\n\nI woke to pounding on our cabin door.\n\n\"Kid! You alive in there?\"\n\nThe First Mate's voice. I dragged myself upright. My shoulders protested. My hands were covered in line burns and blisters. \"Yeah. What is it?\"\n\n\"Crew's breaking out the ale in the mess. You're invited.\" A pause. \"Saw ya out there during the worst of it. When the swells were highest and half my crew was just tryin' not to get swept over. Ya kept haulin'. Earned a drink.\"\n\nGustin was awake now, looking significantly less green than he had during the storm. \"You feeling better?\"\n\n\"Better than yesterday. What's this about ale?\"\n\n\"Apparently I'm invited to crew drinks. Want to come?\"\n\n\"Do I count as crew?\"\n\n\"Only one way to find out.\"\n\n~~~\n\nThe mess was crowded when we arrived. Sailors packed around tables, passing bottles of something that smelled strong enough to strip paint. The Hunter team sat at one table—the Dwarf with his beard still dripping, Senna looking exhausted in a different way than the rest of us, Ash curled protectively in her lap. I hadn't seen her on deck during the storm. Kael quietly cleaned salt spray off his blade. Yara sat nearby, journal open even now, though her hands shook slightly from Mana exhaustion.\n\nAt the head of the room, Captain Ross stood with a bottle raised—she'd held the helm during the storm, guiding us through the worst of it.\n\n\"Listen up!\" Her voice cut through the noise. The room quieted. \"We took a beatin' these past two days. Storm like that, most crews lose cargo, lose crew, lose the damn ship. But we had warnin', we moved to deeper water, and Dawnbreaker held. You all held.\" She looked around the room, her gaze settling briefly on me, then the Dwarf, then the First Mate. \"Even had passengers pullin' cargo when it mattered. Hunters who knew their business. A mage holdin' Barrier over a hull breach while we patched it—saved the hold from floodin'. A beast handler who kept our specimen calm for two days solid. And some kid who hauled crates like he was born to it. Twenty years I've been sailin'—never lost a ship, never lost crew. That's because we listen to our navigator, we prepare, and when it counts, we do the work.\"\n\nShe raised the bottle higher. \"To surviving!\"\n\n\"To surviving!\" the crew echoed, and the room erupted.\n\nCaptain Ross took a long drink, then disappeared back toward the upper deck—captain's work never ended. The First Mate spotted us and waved us over.\n\n\"There he is! The kid who moved cargo like he was half-ogre!\" She shoved a bottle at me. \"Drink. Ya earned it.\"\n\nI took the bottle cautiously. The liquid burned going down, tasted like someone had dissolved leather in alcohol. The sailors laughed at my expression.\n\n\"First time with sailor's ale?\" One of them grinned. \"Ya get used to it.\"\n\nGustin tried it and coughed so hard I thought he'd eject a lung. More laughter.\n\n\"Yer the mage boy, right?\" a sailor asked Gustin. \"Saw ya tryin' to help during the storm. Appreciate the effort even if ya spent half of it lookin' like ya wanted to die.\"\n\n\"I did want to die,\" Gustin admitted. \"I'm not built for sailing.\"\n\n\"Not built for haulin' cargo either,\" another sailor said, nodding at me. \"But yer friend here? Saw him drag that crate across the deck like it owed him money.\"\n\n\"Owed him money and insulted his mother,\" another added. The table laughed.\n\n\"I was there when he grabbed the bindin' instead of the line,\" a third sailor said. \"Thought he'd tear his arms off. Instead the crate moved. Just... moved.\" He shook his head. \"Kid's got somethin' wrong with him.\"\n\n\"Nothing wrong,\" I said. \"Just five years of sword training.\"\n\n\"That explains the arms.\" The older sailor, scarred and weathered, leaned forward with a grin. \"What kind of blade makes arms like that?\"\n\n\"Claymore. Eighteen pounds.\"\n\nWhistles around the table. \"And ya swing that thing? Daily?\"\n\n\"Every morning. Ricardo made sure I could.\"\n\n\"Ricardo sounds like a bastard,\" someone muttered.\n\n\"He is. But an effective one.\"\n\nMore laughter. The sailor who'd seen me grab the bindings raised his cup. \"To bastard instructors who make kids strong enough to haul our cargo!\"\n\n\"To bastards!\" the table echoed.\n\n\"That's not normal training,\" the Dwarf called from the Hunter table. He stood, walked over with the slight sway of someone three drinks in. \"Torvin. Weapons specialist.\" He sat down heavily. \"Aye, eighteen pounds is a war blade—forged for killin', not for show. Most soldiers' arms give out before their form does. You practice daily?\"\n\n\"Kata every morning. Maintenance every night.\"\n\n\"Every night?\" Torvin raised an eyebrow. \"On a ship? Salt air's murder on metal.\"\n\n\"I know. I've been oiling it twice a day since we left Portare.\"\n\nTorvin nodded slowly, something like approval in his expression. \"Good lad. Most warriors neglect their steel until it's too late.\" He leaned back. \"When we dock in Navale, bring it by. I'll check the edge proper—sometimes salt gets into places oil can't reach. No charge.\"\n\n\"You don't have to—\"\n\n\"Professional courtesy.\" He grinned, beard braids swaying. \"Anyone who maintains their blade twice a day at sea has earned it.\"\n\nI hadn't thought about it. Five years of Ricardo's impossible standards had normalized what, apparently, wasn't normal at all. Compared to people who didn't spend their adolescence being thrown across training yards by a sadistic weapons master, I was unusually strong. Who knew.\n\n\"Professional training,\" the First Mate said, nodding at me. \"Fast hands, good balance. Saw it during the storm.\"\n\nKael raised his cup from the Hunter table. \"Your instructor taught you well. Held your own alongside hunters and crew.\"\n\n\"Half-ogre.\" That's what the First Mate had called me. Like it was a compliment.\n\nAnd it was. I'd proven I could haul cargo, fight weather, work like my body was built for it.\n\nBecause it was.\n\nMy palms were raw. My shoulders still ached. But I'd moved cargo the sailors couldn't shift alone. Forty-five Mi—barely enough to manifest a barrier the size of a dinner plate. But enough Qi to drag crates across a storm-tossed deck. The academies had tested one and ignored the other.\n\nThe conversation shifted to sea stories. Captain Ross navigating through Bouris Bay in winter. Pirates. Storm Leviathans near the Deep Sea's edge.\n\n\"We tracked a Frost Drake once,\" Senna offered, Ash curled in her lap. \"Northern Vallis, three winters ago. Thirty feet long, breathing ice instead of fire.\"\n\n\"Did you kill it?\" someone asked.\n\n\"Client just wanted proof it existed.\" She scratched Ash's ears. \"Sometimes the best hunt is the one where nothing dies.\"\n\n\"What about this storm?\" a sailor asked. \"Didn't see ya on deck.\"\n\n\"Two days in the hold,\" Senna said, shaking her head. \"Trying to keep Silver—the Marten—calm. Sedatives only do so much when the whole world is pitching—he was pacing like a caged wolf, wouldn't settle. Had to adjust the dosage three times, talk to him constantly, keep Ash close so he had something familiar to focus on.\" She looked at the fox. \"She hated every minute of it. Fire-affinity creature in a damp hold—not her idea of a good time.\"\n\nSo that's where she'd been. While I was wrestling cargo above, she'd been doing her own exhausting work below.\n\nYara, quieter than the rest, added, \"Hull breach on the second day. Seawater flooding into the hold. I held Barrier over the crack for twenty-two minutes while they patched it.\" She flexed her fingers. \"Longest I've ever sustained one. My arms are still shaking.\"\n\n\"Twenty-two minutes?\" Gustin looked impressed. \"That's... that's really good.\"\n\n\"It's exhausting,\" she corrected, but smiled. \"But the cargo stayed dry. The Frost Marten stayed calm. That's what mattered.\"\n\nGustin and I mostly listened after that, passing the bottle, laughing at jokes we didn't entirely understand. Hunters and sailors and mages, all celebrating survival. I wasn't watching from outside. Wasn't counting coins or calculating angles. Just... here.\n\nSailors drifted toward a corner table where someone produced dice. Sailors' Crown—I'd never played it, but silver changed hands fast enough that I learned the stakes before I learned the rules. Four silver gone. Gustin won two back, grinning like he'd beaten the house. The First Mate cleaned everyone out and tapped another cask of ale.\n\n\"To surviving storms!\" she declared.\n\n\"To surviving!\" everyone echoed.\n\nWe drank. The mess spun slightly. Gustin was grinning, looser than I'd ever seen him. The sailors joked about shore leave and warm beds.\n\nI leaned back against the wall, the pleasant blur of too much sailor's ale softening everything. For tonight, the sailors had accepted me. My shoulders ached from the work, my hands burned from the hemp, and none of it mattered.\n\nEventually the drinking wound down. Gustin and I stumbled back to our cabin, both pleasantly drunk, steadying each other when the ship rolled.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Gustin said as we reached the door.\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"You know. Storm. Carrying me. Ale.\" He fumbled with the latch. \"All of it.\"\n\n\"Same,\" I said, and meant it.\n\nHe pushed the door open. We collapsed into our bunks, the cabin spinning gently.\n\nI was asleep before I could think about what came next.\n\n~~~\n\nThe morning after the storm, I woke to hammering.\n\nMy head throbbed—part hangover, part exhaustion from the storm work. Outside our cabin, the sounds of repair work echoed through the ship's corridors. The storm had taken its toll. Apparently the Deep Sea didn't care that we'd paid for passage—it collected its own fees in torn canvas and splintered wood.\n\nThe First Mate saw me emerge on deck. \"Two, maybe three days added to the voyage. Storm damage. If ya got energy left, we could use hands. Otherwise, stay out of the way.\"\n\nI appreciated the directness. Ricardo would've just thrown things at me until I figured it out myself.\n\nI helped where I could—holding boards while sailors hammered, carrying replacement cordage from storage. My muscles protested every movement, but the work kept me from counting coins and worrying about Mali. At least manual labor didn't require high Mi values. Very economical of the universe.\n\nBy the fourteenth evening, Gustin had recovered enough to resume teaching. We practiced Barrier theory in our cabin—fifteen runes across four sections, the same spell Yara had held for twenty-two minutes during the storm.\n\n\"Try forming Section One,\" he said. \"Just the first three runes. See what happens.\"\n\nHe demonstrated first—fingers tracing Force, Amplification, Anchor while murmuring the optimization chant. \"TE-TA-PA. Now you.\"\n\nI copied the pattern, matching gesture to syllable. The array shimmered faintly—visible, stable, a recognizable structure. Then I pushed Mana through it.\n\nNothing dramatic. No barrier manifested. But something happened—a faint resistance in the air in front of my hand, like pushing against fog. Eight inches across, maybe. Less impressive than my Terra Form. More impressive than my Ignite.\n\n\"That's... huh. Actually something,\" Gustin said. \"I mean, it's not a real Barrier, but it's not nothing either.\"\n\nI stared at my hand. Eight inches of fog-like resistance. Wouldn't stop a thrown rock, wouldn't deflect a blade, wouldn't do anything Yara's had done during the storm. But I'd channeled Mana into something that held shape. My second spell that actually produced an effect—even if the effect was barely more than a stubborn pocket of air.\n\nTwo spells now. Terra Form and whatever this was—Barrier's sickly younger sibling. Not much of an arsenal, but more than I'd had two weeks ago.",

            "title": "1.9 Clear Sailing",
            "content_text": "Chapter 9 - Clear Sailing\n\nWith the storm behind us, I drilled the complete Barrier array until my fingers ached.\n\nGustin had walked me through all fifteen runes before the storm, and we'd reviewed them again during repairs. I'd spent hours drawing the array on paper—four interlocking sections, fifteen runes, each connection precise before I moved on to the next. By the time the repairs were finished, I could sketch the complete structure from memory.\n\nBut knowing the sequence and executing it were different things. Terra Form was six runes; Barrier was fifteen, spread across four interlocking sections feeding into the next. At this rate, I'd master the complete spell approximately never.\n\nSection One I could manage—three runes, three syllables: TE-TA-PA. The partial success on Day 14 had proved that, even if my first attempt had looked more like fog than force. But Sections Two through Four required both hands working in coordinated sequence. KA-TI-KI for Shape definition. RE-RA-KI for Maintenance. TE-RE-DA for Resistance. Fifteen runes, twelve syllables—some gestures drew multiple runes, Gustin had explained. The choreography cramped my hands within minutes.\n\n\"Again,\" Gustin said for the hundredth time, watching me trace invisible patterns in the cabin air. \"Your left hand is lagging on the Feedback transition.\"\n\nI reset. Started over. \"TE-TA-PA\"—right hand through Force, Amplification, Anchor. \"KA-TI-KI\"—right hand continuing with Concentration, Duration, Stabilization—\n\n\"There. You hesitated.\"\n\n\"Because Feedback requires three finger transitions in two seconds.\" My ring finger cramped in sympathy just thinking about it.\n\n\"Which is why you practice until it isn't.\" He grinned. \"Come on, from the top.\"\n\nBy the third evening, I had it memorized. Not automatic like Terra Form, but solid. Could draw the complete array from memory, knew which fingers formed which runes, understood how the sections connected.\n\n\"You're ready to try casting it,\" Gustin said.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" I said. \"After morning Kata practice. Let me sleep on it first.\"\n\n~~~\n\nThe next morning I was on deck early, running through Kata forms while the crew worked around me.\n\nThe sea was calm—calmer than it had been since before the storm. The deck barely moved under my feet. I'd adapted my stances to the ship's roll early in the voyage, but today I could almost pretend I was back in Ricardo's training yard.\n\nHalfway through the Wind-Cutting sequence, one of the older sailors stopped to watch. Weathered face, arms like knotted rope from decades of hauling lines. He'd been part of the crew I'd worked with during the storm—I recognized him, and from the way he planted himself with arms crossed, he recognized me too. Sleeves rolled up to show off forearms thicker than my calves.\n\nA couple of his mates noticed him watching, exchanged glances, and drifted over.\n\nWhen I finished the form and lowered my blade, he swaggered over.\n\n\"That real steel yer swingin'?\" He was eyeing the blade like he was sizing up competition.\n\n\"Sheathed, but yes.\" I kept the blade covered during practice—added a bit of weight, but safer on a crowded deck. \"Eighteen pounds without the scabbard.\"\n\nHe snorted. \"Eighteen pounds? That's nothin'. Hauled crates four times that weight up cargo nets.\" He flexed one arm, casual-like. \"Mind if I give 'er a swing? Show ya how a real man handles steel?\"\n\nHis mates shuffled closer, sensing a show.\n\n\"Go on then, Darrol,\" one of them called. \"Show 'im how it's done.\"\n\nI handed it over, hilt first. This should be educational.\n\nHe took it with both hands, tested the weight—then shifted to a one-handed grip, blade extended like he'd seen officers do in parade formations. Rolled his neck. Cracked his knuckles. Made a whole production of it while his mates whistled and stamped.\n\n\"Right then.\" He wound up for a sweeping strike. \"Take that, ya scurvy—\" The blade came around with decent force. He reset, grinning at his audience. \"And that, ya bilge rat—\" Second stroke, still strong. Third. Fourth. His form was holding, raw strength compensating for technique.\n\n\"Give 'im the two-handed grip, Darrol!\" someone called. \"Yer wrist's gonna snap off!\"\n\n\"Don't need it!\" Fifth stroke. Sixth. But his wrist was starting to wobble, the blade's weight pulling at the joint. Seventh. Eighth. Ninth—\n\nBy the tenth, his forearm was trembling visibly, the blade dipping between swings. He switched to a two-handed grip, managed two more solid cuts, then lowered the sword and shook out his arm, grimacing.\n\n\"Gods.\" He flexed his fingers, working out the cramp. \"How'd I do?\"\n\n\"The bilge rat is definitely dead,\" I said. \"The scurvy might need another swing or two.\"\n\nThat got a roar from the watching sailors. Darrol laughed and handed the blade back, still shaking out his sword hand. \"Gods. How d'ya swing this thing for an hour straight? Twice a day? One-handed, no less?\"\n\n\"Two-handed,\" I said. \"Like you're supposed to.\"\n\nThat got another laugh from his mates. Darrol took it well enough—shrugged and grinned. \"Right, well. Still.\"\n\nHe shook his head, massaging his wrist. \"Forty years haulin' rope. Loaded cargo that'd break a young man's back. A dozen swings one-handed and I'm shakin' like a leaf.\" He studied me now, no mockery left. \"Yer what, sixteen? Seventeen? What's the trick?\"\n\nI didn't have an answer. Forty years of honest labor versus five years of being thrown across training yards. Apparently suffering compounded better than savings.\n\nHe clapped me on the shoulder—harder than necessary, probably salvaging some pride—and wandered back to his duties. His mates drifted off too, show over, back to work. Left me standing there with my sheathed claymore and a question that wouldn't let go.\n\nThis tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\n\nMy strength came from Ricardo's training—five years of daily practice with heavy steel. Or so I'd thought. But this sailor had forty years of physical labor. Decades of building muscle, building endurance. His arms were thicker than mine, his grip stronger from a lifetime of rope work.\n\nAnd his arm had given out after a dozen one-handed swings.\n\nThe storm. Moving cargo three sailors couldn't shift. Working for hours without exhausting the way they had. The hollowed-out feeling afterward—not muscle tired, something deeper.\n\nKael had said something, back when he first saw me practicing. About Qi reserves. Body growing into it.\n\nI found him near the bow, checking equipment with Torvin. He looked up as I approached.\n\n\"Question?\"\n\n\"That sailor who just tried my sword—forty years of hauling rope, and his arm gave out after a dozen one-handed swings.\" I sat on a crate nearby. \"I can swing it for an hour, twice a day. Took me years to build up to that.\"\n\nFive years ago, I'd managed a dozen strokes before my arms gave out. Now I ran the full kata twice daily. All those years drilling Terra Form—failing at it, obsessing over every failed cast—and I'd missed what was happening with the blade itself.\n\nKael glanced at Torvin, who had stopped working to listen.\n\n\"You said something before,\" I continued. \"About Qi reserves—the body growing into it. What did you mean?\"\n\n\"Everyone stores Urja in their cells. Passive. Automatic.\" Kael tested a strap, adjusted it. \"Physical labor builds baseline. Those sailors—forty years hauling rope. High storage.\"\n\n\"But I outwork them—during the storm, just now.\"\n\n\"Different.\" He moved to the next piece of equipment. \"Martial training builds pathways. Not just storage. Body learns to channel durin' movement. Sword forms. Combat stances.\"\n\n\"Channel?\"\n\n\"Active use. Not passive storage.\" He glanced at me. \"Your instructor. Heavy blade from the start?\"\n\n\"Eighteen pounds, since I was ten.\"\n\nKael nodded slowly. \"Body grew into it. Pathways formed while you were still developing. Becomes automatic. Don't think about it. Body just does.\"\n\nTorvin grunted. \"Aye, proper way to train. Start 'em young, start 'em heavy. Forges the pathways deep.\"\n\nRicardo's endless drills. Forms repeated until reflex. Never explaining why—just pushing harder, demanding more.\n\n\"Ricardo taught me to channel,\" I said slowly, testing the word. \"Without ever calling it that.\"\n\n\"Proper instructor.\" Kael finished with the equipment, straightened. \"Most warriors channel durin' trained movements. Automatic. No thought required.\"\n\n\"And during the storm? When I pushed harder than I ever had?\"\n\n\"Went beyond automatic. Conscious effort.\" He met my eyes briefly. \"Exhausting. Burns fast. But in crisis—three, four times stronger than baseline.\"\n\nThe hollowed-out feeling after the storm. The same exhaustion after Ricardo's worst sessions. He'd been building this in me for five years. Training my body to channel without ever telling me what I was learning.\n\n\"Ricardo knew exactly what he was doing,\" I said.\n\n\"Sahash-Dorh Kata.\" Kael nodded. \"Style's designed for it. Sword work and channelin'. Built together.\"\n\nFive years of hating every drill. Every bruise. Every morning thinking he was just a sadistic old man with impossible standards.\n\nHe'd been making me into something the academies couldn't measure. Very sneaky of him. I'd have to be angry about that later, after I finished being grateful.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\nKael nodded once. \"Keep practicin'. Reserves still growin'.\" He paused. \"Give it years.\"\n\nHe and Torvin moved off toward the stern. I rose from the crate, gripping my sheathed claymore. The weight was different now. I owed Ricardo more than I'd ever admitted.\n\n~~~\n\n\"Ready to try casting it?\" Gustin found me on deck an hour later, still processing.\n\nThe sea was calm, the morning bright. I had all fifteen runes memorized. Could draw each section from memory. Had practiced the chant and finger choreography until my hands cramped and my voice went hoarse.\n\n\"I can try. Don't expect much.\"\n\n\"I'm expecting something, even if it's weak. You've got the technique down. Trust it.\"\n\nFeet shoulder-width, weight centered, hands ready—positioning like Gustin had taught me. Then I began.\n\nAll ten fingers this time, not just my right hand like Terra Form. The array was complex enough it needed both hands working in sequence.\n\nRight hand—Section One. \"TE-TA-PA.\" Index finger traces Force, middle finger Amplification, thumb pressing down for Anchor. Each rune formed in the air, invisible but present. The circuit began to take shape.\n\nSection Two. \"KA-TI-KI.\" Index finger circles for Concentration, ring finger vertical for Duration, ring finger circles again for Stabilization. Three days of drilling and my fingers still wanted to trip over each other.\n\nSection Three. \"RE-RA-KI.\" Feedback, Channeling, Terminus. The Maintenance runes that kept Mana flowing properly. My concentration wavered at the diagonal strokes—Gustin's voice in my head: smoother, don't jerk.\n\nSection Four. \"TE-RE-DA.\" Enhancement, Resonance, Isolation. The final touches that would make the barrier actually resist something.\n\nEight seconds. Maybe nine. Concentrating so hard I could barely breathe.\n\nMana flowed into the completed array.\n\nNothing. The Mana thinned and scattered like water into sand—there, then gone, leaving no trace.\n\nThe runes shimmered in the air, the circuit straining to form. But no barrier appeared. Just emptiness where the Force plane should have been.\n\n\"Again,\" Gustin said. \"You formed the pattern correctly—I saw it. Try pushing more Mana into Section One. That's where the Force generates—that should strengthen the plane.\"\n\nSecond attempt. Seven seconds this time, the chant and finger choreography becoming more automatic.\n\nI pushed Mana hard into the Force rune. Something responded—a resistance, like the circuit was actually drawing power.\n\nAnd then—\n\nA shimmer. Translucent, barely visible. Maybe six inches across.\n\nThe tiny barrier floated in the air in front of me, a whisper of Force that looked like heat distortion. I held my concentration.\n\nTwo seconds. Three. Four.\n\nIt faded.\n\nBut it had been there. I'd formed a Barrier.\n\n\"Marcus!\" Gustin grabbed my shoulder. \"You did it! That was a Barrier! Weak, but real!\"\n\n\"That wouldn't block a stick,\" I said, staring at where the shimmer had been. \"Six inches across, four seconds duration. I could defend myself from an aggressive houseplant. Academy-ready, clearly.\"\n\n\"That's incredible for someone at forty-five Mi!\" He was grinning. \"I mean—even people at fifty Mi struggle with Barrier, at least that's what Corvin taught me. Fifteen to eighteen runes all interlocking—it's not just about having the Mana, you need the channeling capacity to hold the whole structure together. But you did it!\"\n\n\"A six-inch shield that lasts four seconds isn't useful.\"\n\n\"It's proof you can learn complex arrays. That you're not just someone who got lucky with one spell.\" He was practically bouncing. \"Try again. See if you can make it bigger or last longer.\"\n\nI tried. Third attempt—six seconds to cast. The shimmer appeared, maybe eight inches this time, lasted five seconds.\n\nFourth attempt—five seconds to cast. Eight inches, held for five seconds before dispersing.\n\nBy the tenth attempt, I had it down to a pattern: Five-second casting time. Eight-inch circular barrier. Five-second duration before my concentration broke.\n\nGustin's three-foot solid barrier could last thirty seconds. Mine was the magical equivalent of a sneeze—brief, ineffective, and mildly embarrassing.\n\nMy arms were fine—no hollowed-out exhaustion like during the storm. I flexed my fingers. Started to form the array again, but my vision blurred at the third rune.\n\n\"You look wrung out,\" Gustin said. \"Mentally, I mean. Not physically.\"\n\nHe was right. Muscles fine. Head pounding. Terra Form had become automatic after years of drilling—my body knew those runes the way it knew how to breathe. But Barrier was still new, still requiring conscious attention for every one of its fifteen components. Five seconds of that kind of focus, and my mind simply gave out.\n\nBut it was something.\n\n\"That's good progress,\" Gustin said when I finally stopped, exhausted from repeated casting. \"You learned a fifteen-rune array in four days and can manifest it. That's first-year academy level work.\"\n\n\"With tenth-year academy level output.\"\n\n\"With forty-five Mi level output,\" he corrected. \"You're working with minimum capacity. Of course your barrier is small and weak. But you're producing it at all.\" He gripped my shoulder. \"When you get to Academia Midur and they test you—show them this. Show them you can learn complex arrays even if your Mi value is at Om Point. That...\" He trailed off, then rallied. \"That proves you're worth teaching. It has to.\"\n\nI looked at my hands. Fifteen runes. Four days. It should matter.\n\nBut I'd already been rejected twice. Belief wasn't something I could afford right now.\n\n\"Come on,\" Gustin said, breaking the moment. \"Let's get food. You've been channeling Mana for an hour straight. You need to eat.\"\n\nMy stomach agreed with him. Apparently magic required fuel. The academies probably had equations for that too.\n\nWe headed down to the mess. My hands were trembling slightly—not from Qi exhaustion like during the storm, but from the sustained mental focus of repeated Barrier attempts. Different kind of tired.\n\nI'd learned a fifteen-rune array in less than a week. Could manifest it, however weakly.\n\nThe academies would probably still reject me.\n\nBut at least I'd tried.",

            "title": "1.10 The Light Beneath",
            "content_text": "Chapter 10 - The Light Beneath\n\nAfter nearly three weeks of grey-blue nothing, the sea woke up. Fish everywhere—schools of silver darting beneath the surface, so thick in places the water shimmered like someone had spilled coins across it. And the dolphins.\n\nThey came from nowhere. One moment the water was empty, the next a pod of them was racing alongside the Dawnbreaker, leaping through the bow wake, their sleek bodies catching sunlight as they arced through the spray.\n\n\"Look at that one!\" A woman at the rail pointed as a dolphin launched itself completely clear of the water, twisting mid-air before splashing back down. \"Did you see?\"\n\nEveryone saw. The whole ship had stopped to watch.\n\nSailors paused their work, gathering at the rails with the passengers. Even the gruff Dwarf woman who usually kept to herself was watching, her weathered face creased into something that might have been a smile. Children—I hadn't realized there were children aboard, they'd stayed below during the storm—shrieked with delight every time a dolphin jumped.\n\nGustin leaned against the rail beside me, some color finally back in his face. For the first time in days, he wasn't gripping the wood like it might betray him.\n\n\"This almost makes three weeks at sea worth it.\" He grinned wider than I'd seen him since we left Portare. \"I was starting to think the whole sea was just... water. Endless, boring, stomach-churning water.\"\n\n\"It is mostly that.\"\n\n\"Don't ruin this for me.\"\n\nOne of the dolphins kept pace with the ship right below where I stood, its dark eye visible through the water. When it surfaced to breathe, it chirped—half whistle, half something sharper—like it was trying to say something. It held my gaze for a long moment before diving again.\n\nMy jaw ached. I'd been smiling—actually smiling—without realizing it.\n\nThe sunlight caught the spray from a nearby leap and scattered into tiny rainbows. The dolphins called to each other in clicks and whistles. Someone behind me laughed—genuine, surprised laughter, the kind you can't fake.\n\nMother would have cast something. Explained the magic behind the dolphins' coordination, the way they moved as one. She'd always been like that—seeing the world through spell theory.\n\nThe thought came unbidden, and for once I didn't push it away.\n\nThe dolphins leaped. The spray caught light. Gustin laughed beside me—genuine, unguarded.\n\nFor a few minutes, nothing else existed. Just dolphins racing a ship through water that glittered like scattered treasure.\n\nThen they vanished.\n\nAll of them. Instantly.\n\nOne moment the dolphins were leaping and calling, the next the water was empty. The fish disappeared too—the silver schools diving deep, the shimmer gone like it had never been there.\n\nThe sea went still. Silent.\n\nGustin straightened beside me. \"Where did they—\"\n\n\"That ain't right.\" An old sailor near us straightened, his weathered face suddenly alert. \"Fish don't scatter like that 'less—\"\n\n\"WHIRLPOOL FORMING!\" The lookout's voice cracked across the deck. \"PORT SIDE! TWO HUNDRED FEET!\"\n\nCaptain Ross was already moving. I'd never seen the woman move that fast.\n\n\"Hard starboard! Full sail, NOW!\" Her voice carried like a war horn. \"All hands! Sea Beast hunt in progress!\"\n\nThe ship heeled as the helmsman spun the wheel. Sailors scrambled for rigging. Passengers grabbed rails, each other, anything solid.\n\nI looked to port.\n\nThe water was moving wrong. Circling. A depression forming in the surface, water spiraling inward toward a center that kept deepening. The whirlpool grew as I watched—twenty feet across, then forty, then wider still.\n\n\"Below decks!\" The First Mate was shoving passengers toward the hatches. \"Everyone below NOW!\"\n\nGustin grabbed my arm, pulling. \"Marcus, we should—\"\n\nMy feet stayed planted on the deck. Something else was rising. Beneath the whirlpool, coming up fast, a light approached from the depths—blue-white, massive, like a cold sun ascending.\n\nThe whirlpool wasn't random. Something was creating it.\n\nSomething was collecting prey.\n\n~~~\n\nThe Leviathan erupted from the center of the whirlpool like a nightmare breaking the surface of a dream.\n\nThe head came first—massive, scaled, jaws opening wide enough to swallow a rowboat. It surged up through the spiraling water and snapped shut on the concentrated mass of fish the whirlpool had gathered. The sound was like wet thunder.\n\nThen the body.\n\nIt just kept coming. Serpentine, dark scales that gleamed like wet iron in the afternoon light, rising and rising as the creature's momentum carried it upward. The visible portion stretched longer than the Dawnbreaker—and beneath the surface, dark coils wound deeper, the body continuing into depths that swallowed light.\n\nBut the crystal formations—those froze me mid-breath.\n\nAlong its spine, running the full length of its back, crystal formations jutted from the scales. Not a glow. Structures. Jagged ridges of something crystalline, blue-white, catching the light like a crown of frozen lightning. And they were lit from within—pulsing, bright, still active from whatever it had just cast.\n\nThe Leviathan's head and neck arced into a dive. The tail whipped up—powerful as a siege engine—and came down with a crack that sent waves radiating outward. Even at this distance, the Dawnbreaker rolled hard enough to throw people off their feet.\n\nThen it was gone. The water surged, churned, and swallowed the creature whole.\n\nThe whirlpool collapsed. The light faded beneath the surface, descending, retreating into the depths.\n\nSilence.\n\nSomeone was crying. Someone else was praying—fragments of old blessings to sea gods I'd never paid attention to. Gustin had his hands clamped on the rail so tight his knuckles had gone white.\n\n\"Gods preserve us,\" someone whispered. \"Gods preserve us.\"\n\nThe First Mate's voice cut through the shock. \"Everyone all right? Anyone injured?\" She was moving through the passengers, checking, counting. Professional. Steady. \"That's it, folks. Show's over. It got what it came for—we ain't on the menu.\"\n\nPeople started talking. The SIZE of it. The TEETH. Did you see the waves? Could it have capsized us?\n\n\"Did you see the teeth?\" Gustin's voice was unsteady. His grip on the rail hadn't loosened. \"That thing could have swallowed the whole ship. Just—just opened its mouth and...\" He ran a hand through his hair, the gesture shaky. \"Marcus, that was a Leviathan. A Leviathan. They're supposed to stay in deep water. What was it doing this close to—\"\n\n\"The spikes.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"On its spine.\" My eyes wouldn't leave the water where those crystal formations had been. \"Did you see them? The crystal spikes. They were glowing.\"\n\nGustin stared at me. \"We almost got eaten by something longer than the Dawnbreaker and you're thinking about... spikes?\"\n\nI didn't answer. The dolphins had the right idea, I thought distantly. My merchant's brain tried to calculate what those crystalline formations might be worth—before the magnitude of what I'd seen overwhelmed the calculation entirely.\n\nThose weren't decorations. They were glowing because it was casting.\n\n~~~\n\nAn hour later, we were back in our cabin. The excitement on deck had finally died down—passengers and sailors alike still shaken but returning to routine. Gustin sat on his bunk, fidgeting with the edge of his spellbook. I hadn't stopped pacing.\n\n\"You're going to wear a groove in the floor,\" he said.\n\n\"The spikes were lit up.\" I'd paced our cabin twelve times already, counting without meaning to. \"While it was creating the whirlpool. What were those?\"\n\nGustin's fidgeting stopped. He looked up at me, glanced at his spellbook, back to me. A familiar pattern—the one where he wanted to explain something but wasn't sure he knew it well enough.\n\n\"You mean the crystals on its spine?\" He ran a hand through his hair. \"I mean... that was its core. Had to be.\"\n\nIf you spot this story on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\n\n\"Its core.\"\n\n\"Crystallized Mana.\" He shifted, sitting up straighter—teacher mode, the way he got when explaining spells. \"When you have enough Mi—above the Om Point threshold—your Mana can crystallize. That's what lets mages cast. The core concentrates and stores Mana, channels it through spell arrays...\"\n\n\"I know the basic concept.\" I didn't, not really—not in any detail. \"Where does the core form?\"\n\n\"The heart. Internal.\" Gustin tapped his chest. \"That's where Mana naturally concentrates in most creatures. The crystallization happens inside, around the heart. You can't see it without...\" He made a cutting gesture. \"You know.\"\n\n\"But that thing's core wasn't in its chest.\"\n\n\"No.\" Gustin frowned, the realization settling in. \"No, it wasn't. The whole spine was glowing. I saw it too—I just didn't...\" He trailed off, then shook his head. \"I don't know. Corvin never mentioned anything like that. Beasts have internal cores. That's what he taught me.\"\n\n\"So why was the Leviathan's core external? On the outside of its body?\"\n\n\"I...\" Gustin spread his hands, helpless. \"I don't know, Marcus. Maybe it's a Leviathan thing? Maybe they're just different?\"\n\n\"Different how?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" He exhaled, frustrated—not at me, at his own limitations. \"Look, Corvin taught me about crystallization, about cores, about spell theory. He didn't teach me Beast biology.\"\n\nI stopped pacing. The pieces connected.\n\n\"The Frost Marten.\"\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\n\"Yara told me some Beasts crystallize along their spines instead of their hearts. She thinks the Frost Marten might be one of them—said the markings on its back could indicate core location.\" I was talking faster now, thoughts connecting. \"Different species, different biology, different core structures. I already knew that. But I just saw it work. The Leviathan's spine was glowing while it cast that whirlpool. External core, actively channeling.\"\n\nGustin frowned. \"Okay... so Beasts can have external cores. We knew that.\"\n\n\"But I watched it function. Same as an internal core. Different location, same result.\" I met his eyes. \"If external cores work just as well for Beasts—\"\n\n\"Marcus.\" His voice sharpened. \"Where are you going with this?\"\n\nI didn't answer directly. \"Yara's the Beast researcher. She'd know more about how external crystallization actually works. The mechanics of it.\"\n\nHe stared at me for a long moment, something wary in his expression. Then he stood up, grabbing his spellbook out of habit. \"Come on. Let's go find her.\"\n\n~~~\n\nWe found Yara in the cargo hold.\n\nShe was checking the Frost Marten's enclosure when we climbed down the ladder. A temperature gauge rested in her hands as she adjusted the preservation array, her attention fixed on the readings.\n\n\"I'm working,\" she said without looking up.\n\n\"The Leviathan's spikes,\" I said. \"The crystal formations on its spine.\"\n\n\"I said I'm working.\"\n\n\"They were glowing while it cast and stopped after.\" I hadn't moved from the base of the ladder. Gustin hovered behind me, quiet. \"Gustin says cores are supposed to form internally. In the heart. But that thing's core was external—growing through its scales.\"\n\nYara paused. The temperature gauge hovered over the enclosure.\n\nSlowly, she turned to look at me. Really look. Like I was a specimen under examination.\n\n\"You're at Om Point, aren't you.\" Not a question. \"Forty-five Mi. Exactly at the threshold.\"\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n\"Most people ask if it could have eaten the ship.\" She set down the gauge, crossed her arms. \"You watched it cast a spell and want to know how.\"\n\n\"I watched it hunt using magic. I want to know what I saw.\"\n\nShe was quiet for a moment. Then she sighed, turned back to the Frost Marten's enclosure, and resumed her work—but she kept talking.\n\n\"Most Beasts have internal cores. Heart-based, usually. Picture maybe half a pound of crystallized Mana concentrated in the heart.\" She adjusted something, checked a reading. \"The crystallization happens internally. You can't see it without cutting the Beast open.\"\n\n\"But Leviathans are different.\"\n\n\"Leviathans are different.\" She moved to another section of the enclosure. \"Their Mana crystallizes externally. Along the spine. Those spikes you saw? That's the core structure. Not inside the body—outside. Visible. Growing through the scales.\"\n\nI stepped closer. \"The glow—\"\n\n\"It was channeling.\" She glanced at me. \"Using the crystallized Mana to power that whirlpool spell. When a Beast casts, you can sometimes see the core light up—internal cores glow through the chest, external ones...\" She gestured vaguely. \"Well. You saw.\"\n\n\"So Mana can crystallize externally.\" I was thinking out loud. \"Outside the body. And it still works.\"\n\n\"For Leviathans, yes. Think of it like...\" She paused, searching for words. \"A regular Beast has a gemstone locked inside a box. You know it's there, but you can't see it. A Leviathan has the gemstone growing on the outside of the box, in plain view. Different location, same function.\"\n\nBehind me, Gustin made a small sound of understanding. A merchant's analogy. Father would have approved—right before telling me to stop wasting time on things that couldn't be sold.\n\n\"Has anyone tested alternate crystallization for sentient races?\"\n\nYara stopped working.\n\nWhen she turned this time, her eyes narrowed. Her hand paused over the tools, fingers going still.\n\n\"That's a very specific question.\"\n\n\"I'm curious.\"\n\n\"You're desperate.\" She set down her tools. \"I've seen that look before. Usually on students who've been told they can't do something and refuse to accept it.\"\n\n\"Has anyone tested it?\"\n\n\"Crystallization experiments for sentient races are dangerous.\" Her voice had hardened. \"Forcing Mana into incorrect pathways causes damage. Internal scarring. Circulatory disruption. Death.\" She stepped toward me. \"Whatever you're thinking—\"\n\n\"Marcus.\" Gustin's voice was quiet behind me. A warning.\n\n\"I'm just asking questions.\"\n\nThe lie hung between us. We both knew it was a lie.\n\nYara studied me for a long moment. Then she shook her head, turned back to her work.\n\n\"Asking questions is fine. Questions are how we learn.\" She picked up her temperature gauge again. \"But there's a difference between asking questions and doing something stupid because you don't like the answers you've been given. The Om Point exists for a reason. Thousands of people have been tested at forty-five Mi over seventeen hundred years. None of them developed functional cores.\"\n\n\"In their hearts.\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"In their hearts,\" I repeated. \"That's what Wizard Om tested. Heart-based crystallization. But if Leviathans can crystallize externally—\"\n\n\"Leviathans aren't human.\" Her voice was flat. \"Their biology is fundamentally different. Distributed nervous systems, different Mana circulation patterns, different everything. What works for them doesn't translate to sentient races.\"\n\n\"How do we know if no one's tested it?\"\n\n\"We know because people have died trying things exactly like what you're suggesting.\" She turned to face me fully. \"Marcus—I don't know your story, and I'm not asking. But whatever brought you here, whatever you're hoping to prove, don't let it kill you. There are worse things than being at Om Point. One of them is being dead because you couldn't accept your limitations.\"\n\n\"I understand. Thank you for explaining.\" The words came automatically—the same tone I'd used when Father's business partners told me I'd make a fine merchant someday.\n\nYara's jaw tightened. She watched us climb the ladder, one hand still half-raised as though she'd meant to say something more.\n\nBack on deck, Gustin grabbed my arm before I could head for our cabin.\n\n\"Marcus.\" His face was troubled. \"What she said about crystallization experiments. The deaths. You're not actually thinking about—\"\n\n\"I'm thinking about a lot of things.\"\n\n\"That's not an answer.\"\n\nI pulled my arm free, gently. \"It's the only one I have right now.\"\n\nHe stared at me for a long moment. His jaw worked like he wanted to say something else. His eyes flicked to his spellbook—the worn leather one he studied every night, the one that would get him through Academia Midur's doors—then back to me.\n\n\"Just...\" He exhaled. \"Don't do anything stupid. Please.\"\n\n\"I'll try.\"\n\nHis hand tightened on the rail. He didn't ask me to promise.\n\n~~~\n\nThat night, Gustin fell asleep within minutes—exhausted from the day, finally getting the first peaceful rest he'd managed since the storm. His breathing was steady from the upper bunk. The Leviathan sighting had drained whatever energy the dolphins had given him.\n\nI wrote until the lamp oil ran low.\n\nMerchant's habit. Father had drilled it into me for years: Note things down. A merchant can't remember everything. Write it while it's fresh.\n\nHe'd meant cargo manifests. Pricing fluctuations. Trade routes and competitor weaknesses.\n\nI used his training for something he'd have called a waste of ink.\n\n~~~\n\nOBSERVATIONS - Sea Beast (Leviathan hunting)\n\nWhirlpool spell to collect fish. MAGIC. Active casting.Ship distance: ~150-200 feet (safe, barely)Size: 100+ feet visible, more below surfaceCrystal SPIKES along spine. Not internal. EXTERNAL.Spikes glowed while casting. Stopped glowing after dive.\nThe core wasn't inside it. The core was OUTSIDE. Visible. Working.\n\nGUSTIN SAID:\n\nCores = crystallized Mana. Form when Mi is above threshold.Normally internal. In the heart.Can't see without cutting open.He didn't know about external cores. Corvin never taught him.\n\nYARA SAID:\n\nMost beasts: internal cores. Half pound crystallized Mana, in the heart.Leviathans: EXTERNAL crystallization. Spine spikes = the core structure.\"Gemstone outside the box, not inside.\"Glowed because channeling Mana through the structure.Different biology. Distributed nervous systems.\n\n~~~\n\nI tried to sketch the spikes. The result looked like a child's drawing of angry grass. I crossed it out. Father would have called it a waste of good paper.\n\n~~~\n\nExternal.\n\nThe Mana crystallized EXTERNALLY.\n\nIt worked.\n\nIt CAST A SPELL.\n\nHas anyone tried external crystallization for humans?\n\nHas anyone even ASKED?\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\nOm Point says 45 Mi minimum for heart crystallizationWhat if that's only true for INTERNAL cores?What if there's a different threshold for external?Yara says Leviathan biology is differentBut the PRINCIPLE is the sameCrystallization can happen outside the bodyIt can still functionIt can still channel\nWhat if\n\n~~~\n\nThe writing got messier here. My hand wasn't steady.\n\n~~~\n\n45 Mi isn't enough for heart crystallization.\n\nEveryone agrees. Two academies. 1,700 years of research. The threshold exists.\n\nBut what if the threshold is LOCATION-SPECIFIC?\n\nWhat if 45 Mi is only the minimum for hearts because hearts are where humans naturally concentrate Mana?\n\nWhat if external crystallization requires LESS because it doesn't have to form inside the body?\n\nWhat if\n\nWhat if\n\n~~~\n\nMother taught me one spell. One. She died before she could teach me anything else—before she could explain why some things were possible and others weren't.\n\nWhat would she have said about this?\n\n~~~\n\nFather would say I'm wasting ink.\n\nFather isn't here.\n\n~~~\n\nThe ink had dried unevenly where my hand had smeared it. The handwriting deteriorated paragraph by paragraph—neat merchant's script at the top, barely legible scrawl by the bottom.\n\nSomeone desperate had written this. Someone grasping at observations because accepting the alternative meant his father was right.\n\nThe academies had rejected me. My father had assumed I'd finally accept it. Everyone said forty-five Mi wasn't enough.\n\nAnd here I was, in a ship cabin in the middle of the sea, writing theories about external crystallization because I'd watched a monster eat fish and couldn't stop thinking about the light in its spine.\n\nMaybe I was delusional. Maybe this was what giving up looked like when you weren't brave enough to actually give up—pretending you had ideas when really you just had desperation.\n\nBut I'd already run away from home to chase one impossible thing.\n\nI closed the journal. The lamp flickered, nearly out.\n\n~~~\n\nSleep didn't come easy.\n\nI lay in my bunk, listening to the ship creak around me, thinking about what I'd seen.\n\nSomewhere beneath us, the Leviathan was swimming. A spine full of crystallized power it had never trained for. No academy. No meditation. No one telling it forty-five Mi wasn't enough.\n\nJust existing. Just being what biology made it.\n\nMeanwhile I had one spell, eight years of practice, and a threshold everyone agreed I couldn't cross.\n\nIn the darkness, my hands rested on my chest. The same hands that had traced rune patterns all day without conscious thought. The same hands that moved through the Kata—through Terra Form—in half a heartbeat, even if the earth barely rippled in response.\n\nThe Leviathan's Mana had crystallized outside its body.\n\nWhat else might crystallize, given the right circumstances?\n\nI didn't have an answer. I didn't even have a theory—just fragments and desperation and the memory of light in the water.\n\nBut I had questions now.\n\nThat had to count for something.",

            "content_text": "Chapter 11 - The Final Leg\n\nWe docked at Deepwatch the next morning.\n\nI hadn't slept well—theories chasing themselves in circles, the same desperate questions filling page after page until the lamp oil ran out. But the port was right there, and practical matters wouldn't wait. Merchant's habit: deal with what's in front of you first.\n\nThe port was Esparre territory—a transit berth on the outer harbor, much like Saltcrest had been. But where our first stop had been grey stone and cold efficiency, Deepwatch felt alive. Colorful awnings stretched over market stalls. The air carried warmth and spice instead of salt and survival. Ships from half a dozen nations crowded the berths, flags snapping in a breeze that actually felt pleasant.\n\n\"Six hours, ya got,\" the First Mate announced. \"Evenin' bell, we sail without ya.\"\n\nGustin and I went ashore.\n\nThe transit district bustled with more variety than I'd seen anywhere. Humans haggled at food stalls. A pair of Elves examined cargo manifests near a warehouse, their movements precise and unhurried. And on the docks themselves—\n\n\"Is that an Ogre?\" Gustin's voice went up half an octave.\n\nIt was. Nearly eight feet tall, grey-skinned, hauling crates that would have taken three men to lift. He stacked them on a cart like they weighed nothing while a human merchant checked items off a list.\n\n\"Two of them,\" I said, spotting another further down the dock. \"And Orcs.\"\n\nGreen-skinned, broad-shouldered, working the ropes with practiced efficiency. They called to each other in a language I didn't recognize, laughing at something as they secured a ship's mooring lines.\n\nMore races in one transit dock than I'd seen in my entire life in Conducere. Deepwatch was a crossroads, and it showed.\n\nWe found food—skewered meat that actually tasted like meat, not salt-preserved survival rations. Two silver for both meals.\n\n\"Want to practice?\" Gustin asked, eyeing a quiet stretch of pier. \"There's time.\"\n\nWe found a spot away from the bustle. Gustin cast his Barrier first—seven seconds, three feet of translucent shimmer. Solid. Controlled.\n\nI cast mine. Five seconds. Eight inches. Same as two days ago.\n\n\"Still faster than me,\" he offered.\n\n\"Still useless.\" I let the pathetic shimmer fade. \"Very economical progress toward inadequacy.\"\n\nGustin's expression tightened. He looked away, toward the Ogre loading another impossible stack of crates.\n\n\"Have you thought more about it?\" he asked quietly. \"The Leviathan, I mean. The external core.\"\n\nI'd thought about little else. My journal was filling with messy questions—external crystallization, spine formations, what it might mean for someone who couldn't crystallize internally. What if the Om Point threshold was location-specific? What if forty-five Mi wasn't enough for hearts but might be enough for... something else? The same desperate logic circling, no closer to answers.\n\n\"I've thought about it.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"And I don't know anything more than I did yesterday.\" The Ogre heaved another crate. Raw strength, no magic required. \"Yara said Leviathan biology is fundamentally different. Maybe she's right. Maybe external cores only work for Leviathans—different biology, different rules.\" I shrugged. \"Very convenient for them.\"\n\nGustin was watching me with that expression he got when I pushed too hard during training. \"Marcus... you know this might not lead anywhere, right? The Leviathan was—it's a Beast. What works for them doesn't necessarily—\"\n\n\"I know.\" I cut him off before he could finish. Believing something didn't make it true. Neither did desperately wanting it to be true. \"I know.\"\n\n\"We should head back,\" I said. \"Don't want to miss the bell.\"\n\n~~~\n\nThe wind was at our backs.\n\nThree days of it—steady, pushing us south and east faster than Captain Ross had expected. The Dawnbreaker kept the coastline in sight, sailing in deeper water but never losing the dark line of land on our port side.\n\n\"Makin' good time,\" the First Mate announced on the second morning. \"Wind holds, we'll reach Navale half a day early.\"\n\nThe coastline changed as we traveled. Rocky Esparre shores gave way to something different. Greener. Scattered growth along clifftops thickened into proper forest. By the third day, the land was a solid wall of green.\n\nAncient forest—trees so tall their canopies formed a continuous ceiling above the shore. Growth that had been there since before humans built cities.\n\n\"Regalis,\" Gustin said, standing beside me at the rail. He'd been talking more than usual these past few days—questions and half-finished thoughts filling the silences. \"Aldric told me about it once. The ambient Urja is supposed to be... different here. Richer. Because of the trees.\"\n\n\"Different how?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly. He said you could feel it. Like the air wanted to fill you up.\" He drummed his fingers on the rail. \"Maybe it helps with crystallization. More Urja available means easier conversion, I think. Or that's what he said, anyway.\"\n\nThe air wanted to fill you up. Poetic. I wondered if it would bother trying with someone at the Om Point.\n\nThough if external crystallization worked differently... if the threshold for forming cores outside the body was lower than inside... richer ambient Urja might actually matter. My journal questions circled back, the same desperate logic I'd been chasing since the Leviathan. No answers. Just more variables.\n\nAldric. Gustin's surrogate father, the village chief who'd studied at Academia Midur decades ago. The man who'd helped Gustin crystallize his Mana before this journey began.\n\n\"What else did he tell you about Regalis?\"\n\nGustin's fingers kept drumming. \"That the Elves run everything. I mean, obviously—it's their kingdom. But he said they're... particular. About humans. About anyone with lower Mi values.\" He glanced at me, then away. \"They don't say it outright. They're too polite for that. But they have opinions.\"\n\n\"Opinions.\"\n\n\"Strong ones.\" His fingers stopped drumming. \"Aldric said to be respectful. Keep our heads down. Don't give them reasons to notice us.\"\n\nSound advice. The kind father would have given. Don't make waves, don't draw attention, let the deal close before anyone looks too closely.\n\nThe forest-covered coast slid past. Somewhere in there, Mali waited. Academia Midur. Answers.\n\nOr rejection. Again.\n\n~~~\n\nWe reached Navale at sunset on the fourth day.\n\nThe harbor was massive. Not just large—I'd seen large harbors. Portare was large. This was something else entirely. The docks stretched in every direction, divided into sections I couldn't count. Commercial berths. Passenger piers. A separate area that had to be naval vessels. And beyond all of it, the mouth of the Regis River—wide enough to swallow three ships abreast, the waterway that would carry us to Mali.\n\n\"That's...\" Gustin's voice trailed off.\n\n\"Big,\" I finished. \"That's big.\"\n\nShips from every nation I'd heard of and several I hadn't. Human traders. Dwarven cargo haulers with their distinctive broad hulls. Sleek Elven vessels that looked more like art than transportation. And everywhere—everywhere—people working.\n\nOn the passenger piers, officials directed traffic—some with hand signals, others with actual magic. Levitating luggage. Illuminating pathways with conjured light. Using spells the way I used my hands.\n\nAnd on the cargo docks—\n\n\"More Ogres,\" Gustin said. \"And Orcs. Lots of them.\"\n\nThey were everywhere. Grey-skinned Ogres towering over everyone else, some pushing nine feet tall, hauling cargo that would have required cranes anywhere else. Father would have calculated the labor savings in his head—one Ogre replacing four dockworkers, the economics obvious. Green-skinned Orcs working the ropes and rigging with coordinated precision, shouting to each other in a language that wasn't Common. Half-breeds I couldn't quite categorize, their features blending human and something else.\n\nA woman walked past our disembarking passengers, three packages floating serenely behind her. She wasn't even looking at them. Just walking, packages following, like that was boring.\n\n\"Aldric said the magic would be casual here,\" Gustin murmured. \"I didn't think he meant... that casual.\"\n\n\"I could do that,\" I said. \"If the packages weighed less than a copper coin and I had two minutes to prepare.\"\n\nHe laughed—nervous, sharp. I wasn't sure if I was joking either.\n\nThe Dawnbreaker bumped against the dock. Sailors threw lines. Somewhere above, Captain Ross shouted final orders.\n\n\"We're actually here.\" Gustin pulled out his acceptance letter, stared at it like it might vanish. \"I didn't think—I mean, I knew we'd make it, but seeing it...\"\n\n\"Different.\"\n\n\"Very different.\"\n\nAn Orc dockworker—seven feet tall, arms like tree trunks—grabbed our mooring line and secured it to a cleat in one smooth motion. His eyes swept over us, past us, already focused on the next ship.\n\nRoyal Road is the home of this novel. Visit there to read the original and support the author.\n\nKael's team was busy near the cargo hold—they'd need hours to offload the Frost Marten and arrange transport to Mali. Senna caught my eye across the deck and raised a hand. Ash chittered something from her shoulder that might have been farewell. Torvin was already shouting at dockworkers about handling procedures. Kael just looked at me for a moment, then gave a short nod. Good luck, it seemed to say. Or maybe don't die.\n\nThree weeks of shared meals, a storm survived together, and that was goodbye. Hunters had work to do. So did we.\n\nI shouldered my pack, felt the familiar weight of the claymore against my back, the fine leather of Father's satchel at my hip. Forty gold, five silver, six copper. An eight-inch Barrier. Knowledge I couldn't properly use.\n\nAnd Mali was three days away.\n\n~~~\n\nWe stepped onto the dock and into overwhelming sensory chaos.\n\nNot the architecture. Not the magic. The sound.\n\nElvish. Everywhere. A flowing, musical language I didn't understand—dock officials calling instructions, merchants haggling, passengers greeting family. They spoke to each other in their own tongue by default, switching to Common only when a human or Dwarf addressed them directly. Even the signage was Elvish first, Common second, if at all.\n\n\"Namaskāra,\" Gustin murmured beside me. An Elf nearby glanced at him with mild approval.\n\n\"You speak Sylvanic?\"\n\n\"About five words. Aldric taught me the basics before I left. Hello, thank you, goodbye, please, sorry.\" He grimaced. \"Namaskāra, dhanyavāda, punarmilāma, kripayā, kṣamā. That's my entire vocabulary.\"\n\nFive words more than me.\n\nThe architecture matched the language—buildings grown rather than built, with walls of shaped living wood and roofs that curved like tree canopy. Street lights glowed without fire, powered by ambient Urja that I could almost feel pressing against my skin. The air smelled like forest and something else. Ozone, maybe. Charged potential.\n\n\"Paper currency,\" Gustin said suddenly, stopping at a notice board near the dock. \"I forgot—Aldric mentioned this. They use paper money here. Dir, I think it's called.\"\n\n\"Paper money?\"\n\n\"Backed by their treasury. He said the exchange rate was... something silver to ten of them? I don't remember exactly.\" He squinted at the notice, which was written in three languages. \"There. One silver equals ten Dir.\"\n\nI filed that away. Currency complications. Because surviving in a foreign city while attempting the impossible wasn't challenging enough.\n\nWe pushed deeper into the port district. The crowds were thick, the streets curved organically instead of following rigid grids, and I kept getting distracted by the constant magic.\n\nA food vendor heated skewers with precision thermal spells. No fire, no fuel—just focused heat exactly where he wanted it. Probably more efficient than charcoal, if you didn't count the years of training required. Children nearby tossed light constructs back and forth while their parents ignored them—street games that would have gotten me laughed out of any academy testing room.\n\nEight inches. I could produce eight inches of shimmer that might stop a moth.\n\n\"Aldric said Academia Midur has been run by the same Archmage council for centuries,\" Gustin offered as we navigated through a market square. \"Elves live so long, they just... stay. The same professors teaching the same curriculum for generations. I don't know if that's still true—he studied there decades ago—but...\"\n\n\"Consistent.\"\n\n\"Or stagnant.\" He caught my look. \"That's what Aldric said, not me. He said the Academy was brilliant but set in its ways. Traditional methods, traditional standards, traditional rejections for anyone who doesn't fit the pattern.\" He shrugged, uncertain. \"At least, that was his experience.\"\n\nTraditional rejections. Something to look forward to.\n\nAn Ogre passed us carrying a crate that had to weigh four hundred pounds. He navigated the crowd like it was empty space, people parting around him automatically. His expression was focused, professional. Just another worker doing a job—one that happened to require the strength of five normal men.\n\n\"We should find Lorenzo,\" Gustin said. \"Get the lodging sorted before it gets too late.\"\n\nI'd been eyeing a side street that looked interesting—market stalls, exotic goods, the kind of place where you could learn things about a city. \"The trading house can wait an hour. We're finally somewhere interesting.\"\n\n\"Marcus.\" Gustin's voice had that edge to it—the one that meant he'd already calculated three steps ahead and didn't like the odds. \"We should find Lorenzo first. Get the passage sorted. Then we know where we stand.\"\n\nI wanted to argue. Explore first, logistics later. But he was right. We needed to know what we were working with before we could afford distractions.\n\n\"Fine.\" I pulled Maria's letter from my satchel. \"River District. Let's go.\"\n\nWe asked for directions twice. The first Elf we approached responded in flowing Sylvanic until Gustin managed \"Kripayā—please, Common?\" Then she switched languages with the faintly condescending patience of someone accommodating a child.\n\n\"River District. Follow the main road to the second bridge, then left along the waterfront.\"\n\nThe second time, Gustin just opened with Common and saved us the awkwardness. But I was starting to understand something: if we were going to survive here—really survive, not just pass through—we'd need to learn their language. Another item on the list of things I wasn't prepared for.\n\nA commotion ahead stopped us. Not a fight—fights had a different sound. This was sudden silence spreading outward like ripples in a pond, followed by sharp Sylvanic commands.\n\nThe crowd parted. Four Elves in uniform—living-wood badges that glowed faintly against dark tabards—strode through the gap with the unhurried confidence of those who knew no one would challenge them. City guards. Had to be.\n\nOne of them raised a hand toward a man backing away—human, by the look of him, dressed like a dockworker. No dramatic gesture, no drawn weapon. Just a casual flick of the wrist.\n\nThe man stopped—not by choice. His body jerked against invisible bonds, arms straining, legs fighting to move. Panic twisted his face as he struggled against something he couldn't see or break. Caught like a fly in amber.\n\nIn Lorisfort, this would have involved six guards, a chase through three alleys, and at least one overturned vegetable cart. Here it took three seconds and a gesture.\n\nI didn't see an array. No glowing lines traced in the air, no geometric patterns forming. No staff, either—the guards carried nothing but those small sticks holstered at their belts. How had they cast?\n\nAnother guard approached the restrained man, spoke something in Sylvanic, then switched to accented Common. \"Unlicensed implements. Possession of restricted magical tools without Tower certification.\" She made a pulling motion, and a concealed bag floated out from under the man's coat. Inside, I caught a glimpse of polished wood—staffs, maybe, or scroll cases. The kind of thing the Mage Towers apparently cared about.\n\nThen one of the guards swept the crowd with something—not sight exactly, but something denser. The ambient magic, already thick enough to taste, suddenly pressed in like a physical weight. My lungs forgot how to work. The air itself felt too full, too heavy, drowning me in something I couldn't see or name.\n\nThe guard's eyes found mine. Held there. Flicked down to the claymore on my back—then dismissed it. Steel wasn't what they were looking for.\n\nWhatever they were looking for, I apparently didn't have enough of it to be interesting. Story of my life.\n\nThe pressure released. I gasped, and Gustin steadied me with a hand on my shoulder.\n\nWhile I'd been recovering, one of the guards had clamped manacles on the suspect's wrists. The invisible bonds released—I saw his body sag with sudden freedom—but by then it was too late. Two guards flanked him, hands on his arms, and marched him away. He went without further struggle. The crowd resumed its flow as if nothing had happened. Just another day in Navale.\n\n\"How did they cast without an array?\" I asked once we'd started walking again. \"I didn't see any staffs, either.\"\n\nGustin shook his head. \"I... don't know. Aldric never mentioned...\"\n\nNow that I was looking—really looking—I started noticing things I'd missed before. Some Elves carried staffs, yes, the traditional kind. But others wore bandoliers across their chests, or belt holders at their hips, each holding half a dozen thin sticks no longer than my forearm. The guards had those too. I just hadn't registered what they were.\n\n\"Those little sticks,\" I said slowly. \"The guards were holding them when they cast.\"\n\nGustin looked where I was pointing. An Elf woman passed us, seven or eight of them arranged neatly at her waist like a carpenter's tools. \"You think that's how...?\"\n\n\"Has to be.\" I didn't know what they were called, or how they worked, or why everyone here seemed to have them. But I'd seen the guard flick one of those sticks just before the spell hit. No array. No incantation. Just point and effect.\n\nAnother thing I didn't understand about magic. The list was getting long.\n\n~~~\n\nCastelli & Sons Trading House was larger than I'd expected—two stories of living wood architecture with warehouses attached, positioned directly on the river docks. The sign showed a merchant ship beneath three stars.\n\nInside was controlled chaos. Crates being inventoried. Ledgers updated. Three clerks—two humans and a half-Elf woman—working at different desks with the efficient speed of those who knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nFather's warehouses looked like this during peak season. Same organized disorder. Same merchants who could sort a stranger's worth in three seconds flat.\n\nA man maybe forty-five years old looked up from a shipping manifest. His eyes moved over us—quick assessment, sorting categories. Two young men, travel-worn, clearly not customers with real money. Merchant's evaluation, merchant's dismissal already forming.\n\n\"Help you?\"\n\nI stepped forward with our letters from Maria. \"Lorenzo Castelli? Maria sent us.\"\n\nThe dismissal paused. He took both letters, broke the seals, scanned them quickly. His expression shifted twice—once at Maria's name, again at whatever she'd written about me. When he looked up, the wariness had softened but not vanished.\n\n\"Maria's cousin.\" He studied me more carefully now. \"She mentions you've come a long way. Marcus, yes? And...\"\n\n\"Gustin.\" Gustin straightened slightly. \"I'm expected at Academia Midur.\"\n\n\"Expected. Good.\" Lorenzo led us to an office off the main floor. His desk was organized with Elven precision—everything in stacks, nothing out of place. He gestured us into chairs that had seen better decades. \"Maria says you need lodging and river passage. Academy testing.\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Both of you?\" His eyes found mine. Held there. \"Without an acceptance letter?\"\n\n\"Walk-in testing.\"\n\nA long pause. The kind where someone decides whether to waste their time on you.\n\n\"I tell everyone who comes through here the same thing,\" Lorenzo said finally. \"Walk-in testing at Academia Midur is... possible. Technically. But their standards for walk-ins are higher than for accepted students. They're looking for reasons to reject you quickly. Makes their paperwork easier.\" He leaned back. \"Why should I help you waste your time and my contacts?\"\n\nBecause my father said I couldn't. Because two academies already told me I wasn't good enough. Because I've spent eight years proving I can do what everyone says is impossible.\n\nNone of that would mean anything to a merchant I'd just met.\n\n\"Because Maria thought I was worth helping,\" I said. \"And you trust her judgment.\"\n\nAnother pause. Then something shifted in his expression—not quite approval, but the grudging respect of one merchant recognizing another's gambit.\n\n\"Fair enough.\" He pulled out a small strongbox, counted paper notes I'd never seen before. Thin, with intricate patterns that caught the light. \"First things first—you'll need Dir. Local currency. How much silver have you got?\"\n\n\"Plenty. But—\"\n\n\"Convert some now. Two silver will give you twenty Dir—enough for meals and small expenses. The rest...\" He paused. \"Get a bank account in Mali if you're staying more than a few days. Better exchange rates. Pay in foreign coin here and merchants will rob you blind.\"\n\nHe handed me the paper notes. Light in my hand, almost insubstantial. Twenty Dir for two silver. I added them to my purse and subtracted from my mental count.\n\n\"River passage.\" Lorenzo produced a slip of paper, wrote quickly. \"Captain Eryndor, the Whisperwind, River Slip Seven. Dawn departure—and I mean dawn, not five minutes after. Elven city, Elven schedules.\" He handed me the paper. \"Give him this. Family rate—six gold each instead of eight or ten. He's reliable.\"\n\nSix gold. Twelve total for both of us. Manageable. And a rate we never would have found on our own.\n\n\"Lodging tonight.\" He marked a map, slid it across. \"Greenwood Rest, three streets from here. Human-owned, fair prices. One gold each for rooms, or share one if you're watching coin. Tell Mina I sent you.\"\n\nOne gold for a shared room. One gold saved was one gold closer to surviving whatever came next.\n\n\"We appreciate this,\" I said. The words felt thin for what he was giving us—not just logistics, but the kind of connections that gold alone couldn't buy.\n\n\"Maria wouldn't send you if you weren't worth the trouble.\" Lorenzo walked us to the door. \"I've seen stranger ambitions succeed. When you make it—tell Maria. She likes knowing the people she helps actually get somewhere.\"\n\nWhen, not if. Merchant optimism or genuine belief, I couldn't tell. But he'd earned the benefit of the doubt.\n\n~~~\n\nThe Greenwood Rest was exactly what Lorenzo had promised—small, clean, human-run. We split the room—five silver each. Mina took our coin and handed us a key without questions.\n\nThe room was modest. Two beds. A window looking onto a quiet street. Elven light-globes providing soft illumination without fire or fuel.\n\nGustin collapsed onto his bed immediately. \"It doesn't move.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The bed. It doesn't move.\" He was grinning at the ceiling. \"Do you know how long it's been since I slept on something that didn't move?\"\n\nI sat on my own bed. He was right. Solid. Stable. No pitch, no roll, no constant adjustment to the ship's rhythm.\n\nWeeks at sea. Storms and dice games and spells I couldn't cast. Questions I couldn't answer—about external cores, about thresholds, about whether what worked for a Leviathan could ever work for me. Progress that felt like standing still.\n\nAnd now—solid ground. A bed that didn't move. Mali three days away.\n\nI counted my remaining coin. Forty gold, five silver, six copper this morning. Minus two silver for food at Deepwatch. Minus two silver converted to Dir. Minus five silver for my half of the room.\n\nThirty-nine gold, six silver, six copper. Plus twenty Dir in unfamiliar paper that felt like it might blow away if I breathed wrong. Father would have hated paper money. Too easy to destroy, too hard to verify.\n\nTomorrow I'd pay six gold for river passage. That would leave thirty-three gold and change when I reached Mali.\n\nThirty-three gold to survive in an Elven city while attempting the impossible.\n\nGustin was already asleep, exhaustion winning over anxiety. His acceptance letter lay on the bedside table, carefully smoothed.\n\nI stared at the ceiling—solid, unmoving, blessedly stable.\n\nThree days to Mali. Dawn departure. Questions without answers.\n\nBut tonight, I'd sleep on ground that didn't move.\n\nThat was enough.",
