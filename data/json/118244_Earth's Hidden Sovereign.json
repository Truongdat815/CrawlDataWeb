    "description": "When Gu Jun was twelve, he inscribed an ancient epitaph on a forgotten gravestone atop Temple Hill — in a language no one on Earth should know.\n\nNow eighteen, Gu Jun is preparing to begin his university life in Tianhai. To everyone around him, he’s just a quiet, unremarkable student. But beneath that façade lies a cosmic legacy — the inheritance of Emperor Qin, the last sovereign of our Universe, the Wild Universe.\n\nEarth, long sealed from the higher realms, is no longer safe. Ancient enemies stir beyond the veil of stars. Forbidden truths bleed into the world of mortals. The coming war won't just be fought with armies — it will be waged in silence, in shadows, and in secret.\n\nTo protect Earth and the Universe, Gu Jun must build what the world must never know: a hidden empire. Trained in cultivation. Forged in secrecy. Bound by destiny.\n\nAnd as the final battle looms, warriors must rise from the dark — or all of creation may fall.\n\nAuthor's Note:\nI’ve been a long-time fan of legendary writers like Er Gen, I Eat Tomatoes, and Mao Ni; their stories have inspired me for over a decade. In my own writing, I aim to follow in their footsteps.\n\nDon’t expect the protagonist to slaughter rivers of enemies in the first chapter. This isn’t a story built on cheap thrills. Instead, I focus on building a solid foundation, establishing the world, characters, and deeper plots. Once that’s in place, expect action, intrigue, betrayal, and tragedy to unfold.\n\n# If you enjoy:\n\n*Medium-Paced Stories with Long-Term Scheming,\n\n*A Bigger Picture,\n\n*Cultivation,\n\n*Way of the Emperor (Emperor is always right),\n\n*Some litRPG Elements,\n\n*Family, Sect, Secret, Darkness, Tragedy, Betrayal\n\n*Dao, Dao Heart, and Heavenly Dao\n\n*Light Romance (Harem? may be)\n\nI invite you to follow this journey.\n\n*I will release three chapters per week.\n\nHappy reading, and thank you for your support!",

            "content": "Very good.\nREVIEWED AT: 15. The Sister-In-Law Incident\nBY Fine young man\n7/21/2025, 5:07 AM\n\nThis is, unironically, very readable. You got flow, the scene pacing is rarely boring, and the power/political stuff is introduced in a way that doesn’t feel like a dry wiki dump. You’re playing heavily in the “Webnovel Cultivation/Modern Reincarnation” genre (e.g. Urban Cultivation, Emperor’s Domination, etc.), but you do it with more self-awareness and some actual character focus.\n\nVisuals: Strong, cinematic intro. “Edge of the solar system” is classic Xianxia-but-with-space, and the “Emperor Qin” setup is hard genre bait, but you sell it well.\n\nLanguage: “His tattered imperial robes fluttered silently, despite the absence of wind.” = clean line.\n\nDownside: Not original—this is classic cultivation trope (ancient emperor, last hope, universe in peril). But you do it better than most, and the existential fatigue is there.\n\nNitpick: “He was Emperor Qin—the last sovereign of the human race from this universe, known as the Wild Universe.”\n\nIt’s a little dry, but whatever, it does its job.\n\nYou skip the purple prose most CNs drown in.\n\nThe “savior emerges from the Solar System” is a nice cosmic touch.\n\nStakes are instantly clear.\n\nSeen this trope before. Not gonna lie. Feels like a blend of “I Shall Seal the Heavens” with “History’s Strongest Senior Brother.”\n\nOpening with the Bike Scene: Bro, this is actually great. Simple, slice-of-life, sets up MC as a real human, not a “chosen one” from page one.\n\nAtmosphere: The ruined temple, silent hill, strange energy—gives off low-key melancholy and isolation.\n\nParental Stuff: You handle broken families better than 90% of webnovels. Not melodramatic, but not cold.\n\nLine to Highlight: “I don’t know if I should love you… or hate you. You placed a mountain on my back before I even had the strength to stand straight. Do you know what that’s like?”\n\nThis is fire. Shows resentment without being a whiner.\n\nEvery flashback feels like it belongs, not just a forced info-dump.\n\n“Supreme Immortal Script”—nice lore drip, not over-explained.\n\nDialogue is believable, not cringy.\n\nSometimes the world-building names (“Wild Universe”, “Death Race”, “Solar Seal”) sound like placeholders.\n\nWatch out for repetition: “His thoughts drifted to the past, toward the strange journey that had been his eighteen years of life.” You use this a lot.\n\nEmpire Power Structure: Low-key, your description of shadow empires and cultivation networks is actually engaging. Reads like a strategy board, not a list.\n\nHeaven-Encompassing Array—not just a generic “barrier,” but some thought put into geopolitics, ley lines, etc.\n\nThe Xiao Family beef: This is how you do slow-burn antagonists, not just mustache-twirling idiots.\n\nTwin Shadows and “Elders” = classic, but you add some flavor.\n\n“It didn't conquer—it curated.” Good shit. Empire by influence, not force, is rare in these stories.\n\nImperial Cigarette—Bro, this is original and memeable. A power-up ritual that’s a literal smoke break? Peak.\n\nThe “Emperor’s presence” switch is getting a little old. He’s lowkey always “radiating pressure” every other chapter. Dial it back or make the shifts more subtle, or it feels like pressing a video game buff key.\n\nDialogue for subordinates (Longwei, elders) is a little copy-paste. You could give them more personality.\n\nLin Mo’s flashback: Brutal, visceral, and dark—nice. But you jump into another tragic backstory pretty fast. Maybe pace the trauma dumps a bit more?\n\n“Noise brings death.” Excellent line.\n\nLin Mo’s training and trauma reads as real, not just “edgy for edge’s sake.”\n\n“Every covert operation, every silent mission, every whisper in the dark answers to him.”\n\nThat’s how you establish a true shadow master.\n\nThe “three personal guards” concept is actually explained well—not just “because I’m the MC.”\n\nStarting to feel like every single important person has some secret trauma or shadow organization. Give someone a normal family just for spice, even if they get murdered later lmao.\n\nTrain Scene: Chef’s kiss. Plays with tropes (arrogant young master, beauty duo, “pay to switch seats”), then subverts with Rong Xi telling him to stay instead of rolling over. The Wang Wei drama is classic but fun.\n\nCampus hierarchy & flower rankings: You get the social dynamic right, even if it’s a trope (flower rankings, family clans, underworld, etc.)\n\nMC’s “average looks”: It’s a little played out (“I look mid but I got swag”), but at least you don’t oversell it.\n\nDialogue is snappy and way less cringey than 99% of similar novels.\n\nYou’re very self-aware: “Bro, you really don’t value your life, do you?” re: Bai Yue’s family.\n\nMC keeps going “I don’t care, not yet.” Feels like you’re stalling on letting him engage with the world for real. Let him make a move.\n\nThe side characters (Xiao Wei, Zhou Hao, etc.)—great setup, but they risk feeling like carbon copies unless you let them act against the MC once in a while.\n\nHumor is solid: The “brother-in-law” running gag is good, and Gu Jun’s trolling of Bai Xue is actually funny.\n\nRomance: You’re teasing harem territory without jumping in headfirst, which is good. No simping, MC doesn’t get flustered.\n\nToo Many Introductions: The first 10 chapters throw a lot of new characters, family names, and power levels at the reader. Pace these out more, or some will become forgettable.\n\nFamily Names: Bai, Rong, Xiao, Wang, Hong, Yang, Su—classic, but start associating them with actual values or personalities fast, or it’ll blur into “who’s who” soup.\n\nPower System: Vitality Sensation, Bright Energy, Dark Strength, HuaJin, Innate, Divine—It’s standard, but you explain it well. Don’t bog down in numbers or stats, just use show-don’t-tell where possible.\n\nMC Power Progression: If you slow-roll his cultivation too long, you risk “blue-balling” your readers. You teased “overpowered but hiding,” so let him pop off at least once in the first 20 chapters or they’ll get bored.\n\nImperial Cigarette. No seriously, that’s iconic.\n\nMC is a manipulator, not a brick wall. He’s got actual EQ and social engineering skills.\n\nVillains feel real: Wang Wei isn’t just a random clown, he’s a believable spoiled kid.\n\nPolitical intrigue > endless fighting. Love that you build threats through social structures, not just punching bags.\n\nBanter: Dialogue is the highlight.\n\nYou’re well above average for webnovel/cultivation stuff.\nYou’re also not afraid to let MC be a little unlikable, which is rare and good. Your humor lands, your power structure is clear (if a bit familiar), and the social intrigue is spicy.\n\nGive your major side characters a memorable quirk or two to separate them. (E.g., Xiao Wei is not just “the peacock,” maybe he’s a germaphobe, or he’s obsessed with classical music, etc.)\n\nDon’t let Gu Jun “monologue in his head” every single chapter. Use his actions and dialogue to show his growth/conflict.\n\nHit us with a fight or real confrontation soon—can be social, can be violent, but we need payoff.\n\nThis is readable, memeable, and actually has some emotional punch. You’ve got the sauce. Just watch the infodumps and introductions, and don’t drag out the “hidden emperor” bit too long.\n\n Report",

But that’s the point. Every chapter lays another brick in the foundation of something bigger. The author takes time to flesh out the setting, hint at the wider universe, and give weight to every interaction. When things finally start to move, the payoff hits hard.\n\nThe prose leans poetic at times—sometimes a bit flowery—but it suits the tone. Gu Jun's internal narration reads like someone who's seen more than he lets on, which keeps you guessing about his real motives and capabilities.\n\nMinor gripes? Dialogue can occasionally feel stiff, and the exposition might trip up readers expecting a more action-heavy opening. But if you’re here for smart world-building, cold charisma, and a protagonist who never shows his full hand—this is absolutely worth the read.\n\n Report",

Beneath the Quiet Sky, a Storm Gathers\nBY dixzeture\n6/22/2025, 5:21 PM\n\nThis has been a brilliant slow-burn so far—elegant, weighty, and rich with intent. Gu Jun isn’t just a protagonist; he’s a strategist wrapped in poetry. That line—'To build an empire not of flags or thrones, but of silence, strategy, and invisible power'—hit hard. It really sets the tone for the kind of power he wields: unseen, inevitable.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes was when Gu Jun reflects on how the Xiao family rose thanks to his own design—'They had forgotten who lit the fire beneath them.' That quiet wrath, that long game? Chilling and brilliant. I also loved the way the Heaven-Encompassing Array is described: 'The skies would whisper his name. The rivers would sing of him.' Poetic and terrifying all at once.\n\nThe blend of modern geopolitics with cultivation lore is really unique. It reminds me of Ze Tian Ji, like you mentioned—but it also has its own cold clarity. Gu Jun's mindset is what makes this shine. He doesn’t posture or monologue for the sake of it. Every thought feels deliberate, every move part of something larger.\n\nThis isn't a story about power being seized—it's about power already owned, waiting patiently to be recognized.\n\nFollowing this one closely. Please keep going\n\n Report",

It starts out quiet, but not in a boring way, just kind of steady, like it’s setting something up without rushing. The whole intro with Emperor Qin was strange and cool. Didn’t fully get what was happening at first, but it made me curious, not confused.\n\nThen it shifts to Gu Jun, and honestly, that’s where it hooked me. He’s not overpowered or cocky, just dealing with a lot. You can feel the weight on him without the story spelling it out.\n\nThere’s this mix of old-school cultivation stuff and almost political planning, but it doesn’t feel forced. Nothing’s too over-explained. You pick up things as you go. And it’s not all fights or action, there’s tension, but it’s more in the background like something big is coming, and the story’s just taking its time getting there.\n\n Report",

The Decision and Thirty Three\nBY HunterCayl\n7/10/2025, 11:34 PM\n\nThe author has constructed a world that has clear thought and planning behind it. What we’ve seen in the first twenty two chapters is only the tip of the iceberg when compared with what’s coming. There is a clear scale for the power that, while inherent in the xianxia genre, hints at a depth of planning on the authors part that goes beyond the early plot. \n\n\nThis is definitely a slow burn story, and the characters are only just beginning to show their colors. There is a complicated political web that is slowly being unveiled for the reader, with the MC, even though he does not yet demonstrate prodigious strength, at the center. He is building a supporting cast of powerful characters, who each have a unique attitude that is fitting within the tropes of the genre. The only negative note with the characters is that some of the more complicated scenes with many characters got a little confusing, and at times I wasn’t sure the right character was referenced. \n\nThere author’s style is consistent throughout the story, and helps serve as a driving force to keep the reader moving. While the chapters are on the shorter side, their endings come across as planned to maximize continued reading. \n\n\nThe grammar is the weakest point of this story. It pulled me out at times because it does change tenses frequently. I have a feeling that the grammatical issues I encountered likely stem from English not being the author’s first language, and translations not perfectly capturing their native tongue. With that in mind, I found the issues far less distracting and had no trouble getting through the work, because the story itself is worth it!\n\n Report",

A Brother-in-Law, Uninvited\nBY Gettsenova\n7/2/2025, 2:25 AM\n\nEarth’s Hidden sovereign is a wonderful example of the Xianxia genre. The author does a fantastic job providing extensive storytelling and an interesting perspective through wonderful writing.\n\nThe narrative wastes no time immersing the reader into its core conflict and high stakes. You know right off the bat what kind of journey you’re in for, with the overarching goal appearing from the get-go. The beginning is focused on world-building and paints a clear picture of the main characters surrounding and goals.\n\nUnlike many stories, where the main character starts out as the clear underdog, the MC in this story has a unique experience and mindset. They aren’t new to a seat of power, already experienced and used to carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders. They’ve developed skills and connections that come with that experience, not relying on physical strength himself (at least so far).\n\nThe author has a very clear and unique writing style that lends itself well to this story and genre. Their prose is often flowery and dramatic, giving it an almost poetic feel that helps heighten the scale and sense of importance. But to prevent being overbearing, the author does a good job of dialing it back when necessary to not overwhelm the reader, using it to elevate the important aspects of his story. This is exceptionally helpful as the epic scale of the story is clear from the beginning, with talk of fate and protecting the universe weaved in. Appropriately, much of the cast is also larger than life, with pieces of sacred beasts and emperors involved, making this story truly feel extraordinary.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this story is minor. The prologue needs a little work at the time of writing this.  It moves in and out of present and past tense, and there’s a strange formatting issue that isn’t present in the other chapters. This is much more obvious on mobile devices, simply appearing to be a different font size on computer.  \n\nOverall, Earth’s Hidden Sovereign does an incredible job at immersing the reader in a well-crafted cultivation story. The writing is beautiful and with a unique setting for the main character, it provides a refreshing change in the standard perspective that I strongly recommend.\n\n Report",

And yet, through sheer will, he had reached the outer boundary of this forgotten cradle of humanity, the Solar System.\n\nBefore him, like a blue jewel resting in the dark, floated Earth.\n\nHis eyes, dim yet unyielding, stared at the planet with a mix of reverence and urgency.\n\n“So… this is the Mother. This is the ancestral land,” he whispered hoarsely. “The origin of life in the Wild Universe…”\n\nThis book is hosted on another platform. Read the official version and support the author's work.\n\nThe words of the ancient sages echoed in his mind:\n\n“As long as the Solar System endures, the human race shall never perish.”\n\nFor billions of years, it had been forbidden for outsiders to enter the Solar System. This law was meant to preserve peace and purity. But alas, Emperor Qin had no other choice now. He had to take this chance.\n\nIt was said that when the Wild Universe faced a true life-and-death crisis, the savior would always emerge from the Solar System. He could see it now: originally, there had been only two planets here, but the ancestors had divided them into eight to complete the Sacred Array, the formation that protected the system.\n\nIt wasn’t a problem for him. He was the Emperor, and he held the key to entering the Solar System.\n\nEmperor Qin could feel his life slipping through his fingers like grains of sand lost to the cosmic wind. His time was short. His energy was fading. But his mission was not yet complete.\n\nThere was still one thing left to do.\n\nWith the last remnants of his strength, he turned toward Earth, his aura flickering weakly.\n\n“I must find the heir… someone worthy of the throne. Someone who can inherit the legacy… and protect our universe.”\n\nAnd with that thought, he vanished into a streak of radiant light, descending silently toward the distant blue planet—\n\n—where the final chapter of an ancient legacy was about to begin.\n\nGreatness begins with a single step into the unknown.\n\nWill you take that step by my side?\n\n-Dark Crow",

            "content": "Gu Jun pedaled steadily through the quiet countryside, the early morning sun casting long, golden streaks across the narrow road. The cool wind brushed against his face, carrying the scent of dew-drenched grass and distant blooming jasmine. The wheels of his old bicycle hummed along the pavement, rhythmic and peaceful, until a sudden shadow darted into his path.\n\nAn old lady stepped out from the roadside brush.\n\nStartled, Gu Jun gripped the brakes.\nThe tires screeched, skidding just inches from her.\n\nShe didn’t flinch.\n\nInstead, the old woman looked at him with oddly familiar eyes and let out a dry chuckle. “Hey, brat. Where are you off to in such a rush?”\n\nGu Jun blinked, tension easing as he recognized her. She was one of the village elders; quiet, strange, and always watching. He gave a faint smile. “Temple Hill.”\n\nThe woman nodded slowly, a distant gleam in her eye. “Then go. Don’t keep the dead waiting.”\n\nGu Jun offered a polite bow. “Goodbye, old granny.”\n\nShe watched silently as he rode off, her figure shrinking in the distance.\n\nAfter a short ride, Gu Jun reached the base of Temple Hill. He dismounted and leaned his bicycle against the roots of an ancient tree. Slinging his backpack over one shoulder, he began the steep climb. Birds chirped in the distance, but the hill itself was eerily silent.\n\nAt the summit stood the ruined temple, worn by time, half-swallowed by nature. Vines coiled around crumbling stone columns, and moss carpeted the fractured floor. Despite its decay, the temple radiated a strange gravity, as if the very air around it remembered glory long since lost.\n\nBehind the temple, hidden among overgrowth and thorny shrubs, lay a solitary grave.\n\nGu Jun pushed aside the brambles and stepped into the forgotten clearing. At the grave’s head stood a simple stone tablet, cracked and faded by rain and years. Etched into its face were symbols that no human scholar could read, yet to Gu Jun, they were as clear as his own name.\n\nThe characters shimmered faintly with residual energy: the Supreme Immortal Script; a language so ancient and sacred that even emperors of the Immortal World treated it with reverence.\n\nThe author's content has been appropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.\n\nHe stared at the words, and as he had so many times before, they echoed through his mind like a voice carried by time:\n\n“Here lies a warrior. A hero of the world.\nProtector of the human race.\nSupreme Emperor of the Wild Universe.”\n\nSix years ago, Gu Jun had carved those words himself, with his own finger, pressed into the stone like a chisel forged from spirit and grief.\n\nBack then, he had been just twelve.\n\nNow he was eighteen, on the cusp of adulthood, the weight of worlds resting on his shoulders.\n\nHis expression darkened as he looked at the grave. Silence hung in the air.\n\n“Old man…” he murmured, his voice cracking. “I’m leaving for Tianhai today. University starts soon.”\n\nHe knelt and began clearing away the fallen leaves and dirt, brushing the grave clean with practiced care.\n\n“It’s been six years since you vanished… two since Father passed. And Mom… Well, you already know. I’m alone now. You left me with nothing but questions. Nothing but duty.”\n\nHe stood again, eyes fixed on the stone.\n\n“I don’t know if I should love you… or hate you. You placed a mountain on my back before I even had the strength to stand straight. Do you know what that’s like?”\n\nHe exhaled shakily, the wind catching the edges of his jacket.\n\n“But I haven’t forgotten your mission. Not a day passes without it burning in my mind. They all think you ran from the war. That you abandoned the battlefield… abandoned them. Even your daughter probably believes you’re a coward.”\n\nGu Jun clenched his fists, trembling with the effort to hold something inside.\n\n“But I know. You didn’t flee. You sacrificed everything to seal the Wild Universe, to keep the Death Race elites out. You bought time… and I won’t waste it.”\n\nA faint glow flickered in his pupils. Deep inside him, something ancient stirred—power, dormant but alive.\n\n“One day, I will enter that battlefield. I’ll unlock the Solar Seal. I’ll reignite the Great Cultivation Era. I’ll unite and lead the army of warriors, and crush the enemy that haunts our universe.”\n\nHe took a step closer, placing his palm gently against the cold stone.\n\n“And I’ll make sure the world knows who you really were. Not a deserter… but a protector. Not a traitor… but the blade that held the darkness at bay.”\n\nHe bowed low, forehead touching the earth.\n\n“This… is my oath.”\n\nAnd as the wind whispered through the trees, it almost sounded like the temple whispered back.",

            "content": "Gu Jun pedaled quietly down the slope from Temple Hill, the morning breeze brushing his face as the countryside rolled past. The rhythmic click of his bicycle chain echoed softly in the silence. His thoughts drifted to the past, toward the strange journey that had been his eighteen years of life.\n\nHis father, Gu Long, was born in this very village. A brilliant student, he had earned top scores and a scholarship to Capital University, the most prestigious institution in the country. It was there, amid the towering buildings and endless ambition, that he met Zi Feng.\n\nZi Feng, Gu Jun’s mother, came from the elite Zi family, one of the ten major families in the country. Back then, they ranked in the top five. Now, they were among the top three. Her name carried weight, her presence turned heads, and her ambitions soared far beyond the clouds.\n\nGu Jun’s birth wasn’t the result of love. It was the aftermath of a drunken mistake, two young people swept up in a moment, never intending for it to last.\n\nWhen Zi Feng discovered she was pregnant, the news stirred some waves within her family, even in the whole capital. But the storm never reached its peak; her grandfather, the family patriarch, adored her. She was the brightest talent among her generation, and he refused to let scandal dim her light.\n\nSo, she and Gu Long agreed to marry. Out of responsibility, not affection.\n\nBut their worlds were never meant to align. Gu Long longed for a peaceful life in the countryside. Zi Feng, on the other hand, was born for power, for politics, for legacy. When Gu Jun was just two years old, she left, without ceremony or tears, and returned to the capital to pursue her destiny.\n\nShe never returned, not once during his father’s lifetime.\n\nYet, Gu Jun never let bitterness take root. His father made sure of that.\n\n“She didn’t leave because she stopped loving you,” he would often say. “She left to protect her future… and maybe yours.”\n\nThe last time Gu Jun saw his mother was two years ago, at his father’s funeral.\n\nGu Long had passed quietly, a natural death. He hadn’t been old, not really. Just one morning, he didn’t wake up. There were no signs, no illness, no warning. It was as if something in him had simply… let go.\n\nDespite all that had happened, Gu Long never remarried. He raised Gu Jun on his own, year after year, with quiet devotion and unshakable patience. Sometimes, Gu Jun would catch his father staring out the window, lost in thought.\n\nAnd now he often wondered:\n\nWas he happy?\n\nBut Gu Long never complained. He smiled often. Worked hard. And filled their little house with warmth. That, perhaps, was answer enough.\n\nStolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\n\nGu Jun’s thoughts shifted to another figure in his life: Master Qin Di.\n\nThe villagers said he had arrived on Temple Hill more than thirty years ago, twelve years before Gu Jun was born. At first, people were curious about the strange man who muttered to himself and stared for hours at the sky. But over time, they decided he had lost his mind. He was dismissed as a harmless lunatic. Forgotten.\n\nBut the truth was far more profound.\n\nWhen his calculations revealed that the next successor to the throne would be born in this village, he sealed away his memories and power to conserve his strength and waited.\n\nAnd twelve years later, Gu Jun was born.\n\nAccording to the tradition of the village, Gu Jun was born in the house, not in the hospital. There were several military doctors present during his birth, but something went wrong. The infant didn’t cry. He didn’t breathe. Panic broke out in the house. His family prepared to rush him to the military hospital.\n\nAnd then Qin Di appeared.\n\nSilent and focused, he stepped forward, placed his hand over the newborn’s chest, and Gu Jun took his first breath.\n\nIt was the moment fate awakened.\n\nAs the years passed, Qin Di became a constant in Gu Jun’s life. A mentor, a playmate, and eventually a teacher, though Gu Jun didn’t realize it at first. Many of his childhood days were spent at Temple Hill, listening to his master’s strange riddles, climbing the old temple ruins, or simply gazing at the stars beside him.\n\nAnd then came that day.\n\nGu Jun was twelve years old.\n\nStrangers came to the village, men cloaked in black, silent and ruthless. They weren’t robbers. They had come for him.\n\nBy then, Zi Feng had risen to power. After her grandfather’s death, she had taken the helm of the Zi family. With status came enemies. And they saw Gu Jun as a weakness they could exploit.\n\nHe hadn’t seen his mother in ten years.\n\nBut he didn’t resent her.\n\nHis father always said she had left to protect him. That she had hidden him away in this quiet village for his own safety. And when the attack came, he learned it was true.\n\nA secret guard, stationed in the shadows by his mother, emerged to protect him. But there were too many attackers. Too skilled. The guard was overwhelmed.\n\nThen Qin Di appeared.\n\nWith a single wave of his hand, the invaders were turned to dust.\n\nBut the cost was great.\n\nTo awaken his sealed power, Qin Di had shattered the bindings on his soul. His body began to collapse. His time was running out.\n\nFor one day and one night, Qin Di sat with Gu Jun beneath the ancient trees of Temple Hill. He spoke of histories. He told him of the Death Race, the Wild Universe, and the Solar Seal. It sounded like a fairy tale, but Gu Jun knew it was real.\n\nBefore his final breath, Qin Di transferred his last reserves of qi into Gu Jun’s body, cleansing it, refining it, preparing it to inherit the path ahead.\n\nThen he was gone.\n\nGu Jun buried him on Temple Hill, under the crumbling shadow of the temple. And with his bare hand, he carved an epitaph into the gravestone in a language the earth had long since forgotten.\n\nA silent vow etched in stone.\nA legacy passed in silence.\nAnd the beginning of something far greater.",

            "content": "Gu Jun pedaled steadily down the narrow road that wound through the countryside, leaving Temple Hill behind. He wasn't in a rush, but he couldn't afford to waste time. He had to reach home, grab his things, and head for Tianhai.\n\nThe bike creaked beneath him as it rolled downhill, tires humming softly over sunlit patches of gravel and grass. On either side, fields stretched in silence, tall stalks swaying in the still air like quiet observers. A few birds called out from the trees, and leaves whispered above, but none of it touched him. His mind was elsewhere.\n\nSix years. That's how long the mantle had rested on him. The Wild Universe. A legacy older than memory, heavy, silent, star-wide. It wasn't something you wore; it was something that settled on you, buried you, forced you to stand tall anyway.\n\nHe wasn't building an empire of flags and crowns. Not a throne of gold or steel. No, his was an empire of influence. Of silence. Of control that moved beneath the surface like a current no one saw until it swept them away.\n\nTruth be told, he also wanted to control everything openly, but that wasn’t possible right now. Too much was at stake, and too many threats lay beyond his control.\n\nHis thoughts flicked to scale. To the size of the world he intended to shape.\nEarth now held more than ten billion people. And from that sea, three great forces had risen:\n\nCountry X: his homeland, the furnace where his vision took shape. It was his foundation.\n\nCountry M: a machine disguised as a state, layers of logic, networks of code, humming with invisible power.\n\nCountry B: forged in blood and sharpened by war, it clenched half the globe in its grip.\n\nHe knew better than to take them all on at once. The board was too large.\nSo he started at home, Country X. That was where the first real test would be.\n\nHalf of his total strength and resources were now concentrated in Country X. He must control it and be able to manipulate it according to his will.\n\nAmong this half, twenty percent was concentrated in Nator, the nation’s capital, as it was the power center. If you wanted to control a country, you had to control its capital. Ten percent was concentrated in Tianhai, as it was the current operations center. The remaining twenty percent was spread across ten other provinces.\n\nAlready, his hidden empire flowed through the nation's veins; wealth, intelligence, energy, cultivation, channeled with quiet precision.\n\nThe other half spread through the rest of the world.\n\nTianhai was the hinge. A coastal province flanked by trade routes, shielded by mountains, laced with ley lines, the old texts still whispered about. This was where the next act would begin.\n\nAnd Gu Jun knew the burden of it would fall entirely on him. No one else could bear it. No one else would even understand it.\n\nHe was preparing something ancient. Something vast. The Heaven-Encompassing Array.\n\nUnauthorized content usage: if you discover this narrative on Amazon, report the violation.\n\nIt was not a simple formation; this would wrap the entire province in a net of qi, geometry, spirit, and sacrifice. And once it was activated...\n\nThe skies would murmur his name. The rivers would echo it. Even the breath of the living would bend, ever so slightly, toward his will.\n\nNo secrets. No escape.\n\nOnly one problem remained. One piece refused to fit:\n\nThe Xiao family.\n\nThey ran Tianhai like it belonged to them. Money, muscle, backroom power, they had fingers in everything. From law enforcement to merchant guilds, from old temples to the latest telecom networks. And the irony? The Gu Empire had put them there.\n\nEighteen years ago, when Gu Jun was born, this plan was started. Back then, the Xiao were a middling clan, ambitious but limited in power. The Empire gave them scrolls. Gave them tools. Watched them climb.\n\nFirst came loyalty. Then pride. Then arrogance.\n\nNow they stood tall.\n\nToo tall. They'd forgotten who fed them.\n\nThey thought they could push back against the very hand that carved their path.\n\nA mistake.\n\nThe Gu Empire had always worked in the shadows. It didn't conquer, it curated. Quiet influence across countless domains. It tested, watched, and waited. And when people failed those tests, the consequences were already in place.\n\nAnd The Xiao? They thought their independence was a sign of strength. That rising on their own meant they'd outgrown their lord.\n\nFools.\n\nSure, they had strength. Their old patriarch was no slouch, mid-Innate, and had a solid foundation. They had control over the underworld and the government. They'd clawed their way into commerce and the military, too. They had a huge influence not only on Tianhai but also on the whole country.\n\nBut Gu Jun had moved beyond all that. His metrics were different now. It was a lot deeper.\n\nOnce the Heaven-Encompassing Array was online, even high-stage cultivators would feel it. Their souls would quiver under its net. And even now, without it, he could break the Xiao family if he wanted to. Tianhai was his ground.\n\nThey would yield. Or they would fall.\n\nAnd they weren't the only ones drifting from the path. There were governors. Generals. Corporate giants. People who'd once received his hand and were now slowly pulling away from it.\n\nThat, too, had been expected.\n\nLet them fall away. Let them show their colors before the final move. For every one that strayed, dozens were waiting in the wings, hungrier, more loyal, more capable.\n\nThe Wild Universe had no use for pride dressed up as freedom.\n\nAnd once Tianhai was secured, once the Xiao were reduced or removed, the path would stretch forward.\n\nToward Nator.\n\nThe capital.\n\nThe place where empires had risen and collapsed for centuries. The throat of the country. The center of everything. Soon, it would no longer be the crown of the old world. It would be the stepping stone for the next one.\n\nAnd when it fell, it wouldn't be the end of his plan.\n\nIt would be the second checkpoint.\n\nThe Imperial sword had just begun to rise.",

            "content": "Gu Jun returned home in silence.\n\nHe placed his coat on the stand, moved through the quiet chambers, and completed a few idle tasks, absent-minded, habitual. Then, with a sigh that carried the weight of the Empire, he sat.\n\nHe lifted a porcelain cup, steam curling like spirit wisps from the surface. The tea was bitter and strong, his father's favorite.\n\nAfter the final sip, he reached for a small black case.\n\nA click.\n\nA flicker of flame, and the smoke was generated.\n\nThe imperial cigarette was lit.\n\nIt was a relic of sovereignty, one of the many legacies passed down from Qin Di, his silent, sealed predecessor. In the legends of the Wild Universe, only those of the Emperor’s Blood dared to inhale its power. Though others had smoked through pipes carved from celestial jade or incense bowls shaped from moonstone, Gu Jun rejected such tradition.\n\nHe preferred modernity. A steel cylinder, simple and clean.\n\nAfter all, it was not the vessel, but the essence that mattered.\n\nThis cigarette, unlike anything found in the mundane world, was crafted from rare sky-herbs and powdered flood dragon horn. Its scent was sweet yet wild, floral notes wrapped in something ancient and untamed. It wasn’t just a vice. It was a ritual. It was an identity.\n\nIt was said to enhance one’s masculinity and grace, a symbol of command passed down for millions of years.\n\nWhen the imperial cigarette is lit, something within Gu Jun shifts.\n\nBy outward appearance, he is unremarkable. Standing at 5'9\", with a face that blends easily into a crowd, he’s the kind of man one might pass on the street and forget within moments. Nothing is striking about his looks, nothing that demands attention. He doesn’t radiate charisma or project dominance, at least, not at first glance.\n\nBut the moment he inhales that first curl of smoke, the air around him thickens with something intangible. His gaze sharpens, posture straightens, and presence expands. It’s as if an invisible crown settles on his head, and the weight of destiny aligns behind his eyes.\n\nIn that moment, Gu Jun is no longer ordinary. He becomes unreachable, a sovereign cloaked in silence, radiating the quiet pressure of command. A man not shaped by the world, but preparing to shape it in return.\n\nGu Jun leaned back, smoke coiling through the dim light, and stared into the deepening dusk.\n\nFive kilometers away, someone walked with purpose.\n\nHe moved slowly, but each stride carried him ten meters forward. His presence went unnoticed, not because he hid, but because the world simply refused to acknowledge him.\n\nHe looked to be around thirty. His face was carved with quiet purpose, an indifferent expression, and a thin scar cutting across his cheekbone. It told of violence endured, not declared.\n\nHe reached Gu Jun’s estate and stepped inside.\n\nWithout a word, he entered the inner hall, his indifferent expression changed, became respectful and devoted, and then he offered a measured bow. “Greetings, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun didn’t turn. The cigarette glowed between his fingers.\n\nSince the coronation ceremony had yet to be held, Your Highness remained in the proper form.\n\nOnly after a pause did Gu Jun speak, his voice calm and commanding.\n\nThis text was taken from Royal Road. Help the author by reading the original version there.\n\n“What’s the update?”\n\n“Everything is prepared,” the man replied respectfully. “The Planning Council has finalized the annexation strategy for Tianhai. These are the documents.”\n\nHe carefully placed the papers on the low marble table with precise hands.\n\nThis was Longwei, Sixth Elder of the Gu Empire. Chief Messenger. One of the Twelve Pillars. One of the ten people alive who knew the true identity of Gu Jun.\n\n“Strike group?” Gu Jun asked without looking.\n\n“Ready. Strike One has broken through to the peak of the initial-stage Innate. The other two remain at early Innate, no progress, but stable.”\n\nGu Jun nodded faintly. “The Xiao family?”\n\n“We’ve identified three internal factions: one hostile, one loyal to us, and one undecided. Their power is evenly distributed. Our strategy is to support the loyalist faction and let them consume the rest from within.”\n\n“How long?”\n\n“Approximately four months.”\n\nGu Jun frowned slightly.\n\nWhen he saw Gu Jun's frown, Longwei felt his heart suddenly stop, and tiny beads of sweat began to form on his forehead.\n\n“Hmm, longer than expected. But we must do it cleanly. No mistakes.\"\n\nLongwei let out a sigh of relief; he felt his heart start working again.\n\n\"And the formation?”\n\nThis time Longwei's eyes changed and became a lot more serious, and he replied, “Progressing well. We’ve located all but the final piece. Once it’s set, activation will take three months. After that, we will have full control over Tianhai.”\n\n“Where’s the last piece?”\n\n“Antarctica.”\n\nThe Heaven-Encompassing Array required multiple ancient components, each connected to ley lines buried deep in the Earth. The Gu Empire had secured them all, except one. Once integrated, the array would root itself into the planet’s core.\n\nGu Jun’s cigarette burned low, but the scent became sharper and sharper.\n\n“And your cultivation?” he asked.\n\n“I’m approaching the peak of mid-Innate. I expect to break through within weeks.”\n\n“Good.” Gu Jun stood. “I leave for Tianhai tonight.”\n\nLongwei replied respectfully, “We’ve prepared everything, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun gave a small wave. “You may go.”\n\nLongwei bowed again. “Farewell, Your Highness.”\n\nHe left as quietly as he had come.\n\nGu Jun watched the door close behind him.\n\nLongwei had once been one of twenty chosen not for wealth or lineage, but for something deeper. A rare convergence of potential and obedience. Each had been given resources and a unique cultivation method. Unlike the Xiao family and other pawns, these twenty were not tested.\n\nThey were forged.\n\nNow, they stood as the Empire’s true core, powerhouses without peer, invisible giants holding up a kingdom born in shadow.\n\nThe room grew still.\n\nThen, Gu Jun’s shadow twisted unnaturally across the floor, lengthening… expanding. It was really a weird site.\n\nAs the shadow became bigger, from its depths, two figures emerged.\n\nA man and a woman, both appearing no older than twenty.\n\nThe male was quiet, his eyes cold and calculating. The female was his mirror opposite; vibrant, mischievous, eyes alight with curiosity and fire. Despite their stark contrast, they were twins, united by origin, divided by temperament.\n\nYingchen and Yinglan. The Twin Shadows of Gu Jun. Both were strikingly attractive and had followed Gu Jun for nearly six years. Once abandoned children, they were unlike others, given the best resources to rapidly cultivate strength. But that rapid rise came with a price. Their progress eventually slowed, and now both remained at the mid-Innate stage, strong, but stalled.\n\nAlthough they were both Mid-Innate, their combined attack could kill a late-stage Innate. And if they used their surprise attack, combined their special skill, and their Super Innate weapon, they could heavily injure a peak Innate.\n\n“Master,” Yinglan said, stretching her arms dramatically. “I’m so bored. When are we going to Tianhai? I am telling you that after we go to Tianhai, you have to let me play more frequently.”\n\nGu Jun smiled; a rare flicker of warmth could be seen in his eyes, and he reached out to tousle her hair.\n\nShe was the only soul in the world who received such treatment from him. Not even the elders dared such closeness.\n\nNot yet.",

            "content": "Gu Jun then stepped into the inner chamber of the house.\n\nIt was quiet here, a place untouched by time. He moved to the window, letting his gaze settle on the far horizon where the sky kissed the earth. The late light slanted across the floor, casting long shadows, echoes of the weight in his heart.\n\nHe spoke aloud, though no one else seemed present.\n\n\"I'm confused,\" he murmured. “I can’t help but feel... I’m the reason my master died. If he hadn’t broken the seal for me, he might still be alive. It feels... unfair.”\n\nTo a passerby, it would have seemed he was talking to himself. But in the stillness, something shifted.\n\nFrom the air itself, like a ripple through unseen dimensions, a silhouette emerged.\n\nIt had no face, no body. Only the faint, shifting outline of a humanoid form, flickering like smoke at the edge of reality. A being not bound by the physical world. To behold it was to feel awe or dread.\n\nThen it spoke. Its voice was not heard with the ears, but felt in the bones.\n\n“Even without the attack, your master would not have lived long. Remember, you were nearly twelve when the seal broke. Enlightenment was near. And at that moment, his death was inevitable.”\n\nA pause.\n\n“Had we wished it, those pitiful assassins would never have reached you. But your master believed it unnecessary. He chose the sacrifice.”\n\n“Hmm…” Gu Jun gave a soft, hollow sound, his eyes still distant.\n\nThe silhouette continued, its tone ancient and firm.\n\n“You must not linger in guilt. Focus now on your path, your mission. I have existed far longer than you can comprehend. So long, I sometimes forget who I once was. But I have witnessed such sacrifices before. Rare, yes, but not unknown. He gave his life to fulfill his vow. One day, you may have to do the same. That is the burden of power.”\n\nThe air grew heavier as it spoke.\n\n“Never forget your responsibility to this universe, to humanity, and to the legacy that shaped you. You carry not only your master’s hopes but the grace of generations.”\n\nThis shadowed figure was Xuanzhi, one of Gu Jun’s greatest inheritances from Qin Di.\n\nMore than a relic, Xuanzhi was an ancient construct, a soul fragment carved from the Black Tortoise, a sacred beast whose consciousness had endured for over a hundred million years. Neither ghost nor machine, Xuanzhi was a sentient echo of immense age, gifted with memory, wisdom, and unshakable loyalty.\n\nFor thirty generations of Qin Emperors, he had served silently as an advisor, archivist, and unseen guardian.\n\nDespite his otherworldly presence, Xuanzhi held no combat strength of his own. He could shift through space, vanish into shadow, move between dimensions, but these gifts came with limits. Excessive use would drive him into a deep slumber. And more importantly, he was bound to Gu Jun’s proximity, unable to travel far from his sovereign.\n\nThese limitations, however, were temporary. As Gu Jun’s power grew, so too would Xuanzhi’s freedom.\n\nThe narrative has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\n\nIt was during one of Qin Di’s final lucid moments, after Gu Jun’s birth, that he released Xuanzhi, setting the last threads of his vast design into motion.\n\nAnd now, that design was unfolding.\n\nXuanzhi’s voice softened.\n\n“Live a human life where you can—even if only in fragments. Your father wished that for you. He knew your burden, even if not in full. He did not want it to crush you too early.”\n\n“You are well-trained, but still young. This is the age of confusion, of passion, of impulse. Tread carefully, Gu Jun. Your path demands it.”\n\nGu Jun nodded silently.\n\nFifteen years ago.\n\nA village forgotten by the capital, nestled at the edge of the country.\n\nIt was a time when law and order had begun to stretch their arms, promising justice and stability. In the heartlands, laws were enforced, criminals were punished, and people started to believe in peace.\n\nBut the borders, those frayed edges of civilization, were a different world entirely.\n\nThere, the law thinned like mist in the morning sun. Power belonged to whoever held a blade and the will to use it. Raiders, mercenaries, and exiles crossed from neighboring lands, their hearts untouched by treaties or fear of reprisal. To them, the border wasn’t a wall; it was an open wound waiting to be exploited.\n\nOn that day, in one such village, a boy named Lin Mo played in the dust.\n\nHe was two and a half years old.\n\nThe sky was overcast, the sun hidden behind layers of dull gray clouds. He sat near the doorway of his home, shaping little mounds of dirt into towers with his tiny fingers. His mother worked nearby, humming softly. Her presence made the world feel whole.\n\nThen the silence was shattered.\n\nThere were shouts and screams.\n\nStrangers burst into the village, men with hardened faces and cold eyes, bearing weapons soaked in rust and blood. They came not for conquest, but for carnage. What followed wasn’t war, it was slaughter.\n\nThey moved through the village like wildfire. Men were cut down mid-task. Women begged. Children cried. None were spared. Even livestock were butchered, not from need, but from cruel delight.\n\nLin Mo had no words for what he saw, only images burned into his mind forever. His father’s voice shouted from the fields. The neighbor who gave him sweets, an axe buried in the old man’s chest.\n\nHis mother didn’t run. She grabbed him, pulled him to her chest, shielding his tiny body with her own. Her heartbeat thundered against his ear.\n\nThen came the spear.\n\nHe remembered the grunt she made, sharp, short, as it pierced her back. Her arms tightened for one final second, as if her last act of will was to protect him.\n\nThen… silence.\n\nThe raiders assumed she was dead, and Lin Mo with her.\n\nThey moved on.\n\nAfter the slaughter, they looted everything, grain, tools, jewelry, even a few surviving girls and children, dragged away screaming. Then they set fire to the homes, watching with amusement as flames devoured roofs and memories.\n\nBefore leaving, they gathered the dead. Corpses were thrown into a wide pit at the center of the village.\n\nLin Mo, still wrapped in his mother’s lifeless embrace, was thrown in with them.\n\nHe didn’t cry. He didn’t scream. Maybe the shock had locked his voice away. Or maybe, even then, something deep inside understood:\n\nNoise brings death.\n\nFor six long hours, he lay in that grave.\n\nThe heat from the fires. The stench of burnt hair and flesh. The weight of bodies pressing down, sickening, yet oddly warm. Even as a toddler, the memory etched itself deep into his soul.\n\nThe blood was soaking into his skin.\nThe cold stillness of his mother’s arms.\nThe face of the man who killed her; calm, almost bored.\n\nHe would never forget.\n\nSomething inside Lin Mo died that day.",

            "content": "Six Hours Later\n\nLin Mo was barely conscious.\n\nSix hours had passed since the massacre, and every moment had been a slow descent into darkness. His tiny body, still nestled in the arms of his dead mother, was numb, his skin soaked in blood, his senses dulled by smoke and silence. He was cold. Hungry. His vision blurred and dimmed.\n\nThen he heard footsteps.\n\nA shadow appeared at the edge of the pit. It was a figure of a boy, maybe fifteen, standing and looking down with sharp eyes and a strange calm. He wore black robes, neat and unstained. His silver hair gleamed even in the ash-covered air.\n\nLin Mo was saved that day, though he wouldn’t understand the cost until many years later.\n\nPresent Day – Unknown Location\n\nLin Mo awoke with a start; his body was covered in sweat, breath sharp, heart pounding.\n\nIt was that nightmare again. The one that returned like clockwork, screams, blood, the dead stares of his mother and father. He rubbed his eyes and sat up. The bed was stiff, the room cold, and dimly lit by the lantern's glow.\n\nOutside, the morning drills had begun. He stepped onto the balcony of the fortress-like structure. Below, disciples meditated in rows, their breaths synchronized like a tide.\n\nFifteen years had passed since that day.\n\nLin Mo was now nearly eighteen, no longer the boy who cried in a grave of corpses. He had been forged in shadow and trained in silence. His body bore scars that no healer could erase, and his mind was sharp, hardened like tempered steel.\n\nThe man who saved him all those years ago was no ordinary rescuer. He was LongChen, the Left Protector of the Gu Empire, one of the three most powerful cultivators in the empire.\n\nHe is the unseen shield of the empire, the one who guards from the shadows.\n\nEvery covert operation, every silent mission, every whisper in the dark answers to him.\n\nBe it the Dark Guards, the Hunters, or the spies and assassins, he commands every force that moves unseen, safeguarding the empire from within and without.\n\nLongChen was also Lin Mo’s master.\n\nA soft, near-silent sound of footsteps approached. Lin Mo turned. He recognized the pattern immediately; it was like the footfall of a hunter stalking prey.\n\nLongChen entered, dressed as always in black. His features were perfect, symmetrical, unnervingly handsome, yet somehow false, as though sculpted rather than born. His silver hair shimmered with unnatural sheen.\n\nNo matter how long Lin Mo had known him, he had never been able to read the man. There was always a layer he couldn’t reach, a depth he couldn’t fathom.\n\nSupport creative writers by reading their stories on Royal Road, not stolen versions.\n\n“You’re awake,” LongChen said, voice low and calm.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“How is your realm consolidation?”\n\n“Complete,” Lin Mo replied. “Stable and solid.”\n\nHe had broken through to the Innate Realm days ago. Since then, he had spent every hour stabilizing his new power. The process had been agonizing, but necessary. Now, he was ready.\n\nLongChen nodded. “Good. That means you’re ready. No mistakes. No shame to my name.”\n\nThere was an unusual gravity in his tone. LongChen was always serious, but today, something else lingered behind his words. A weight.\n\nLin Mo noticed. “Is something wrong?”\n\n“No,” LongChen said. “But you’re about to receive your most important mission to date.”\n\nHe paused. Then he added with unusual gravity in his tone, “His Highness is coming to Tianhai. You will be one of his three personal guards.”\n\nLin Mo froze. The moment had come.\n\nHe had trained for this day, endured brutal drills, impossible trials, and years of shadow warfare. Now, he would finally serve beside the Emperor’s chosen, not as a servant, but as one of his silent blades.\n\nHe understood the structure. There would be three guards:\n\nThe leader of the Light Guards, a peer around his age, was known for his bright demeanor and transparent tactics. He served openly and was the face of protection, always visible, always smiling. His master is the Right Protector of the Empire, another titan in cultivation and authority.\n\nThe Dark Guard, shadow-bound and ever-present, would never leave the Emperor’s side. No matter what happened, even under direct attack, they were never to retreat. To do so would mean exposing the Emperor to danger.\n\nThen there was the Hunter, Lin Mo’s role.\n\nHe would strike when others fell. He would pursue fleeing enemies, execute the Emperor’s will, and serve as the executioner in darkness. If a threat appeared, Lin Mo would be the blade that silenced it.\n\nSwift. Silent. Deadly.\n\nA role for which he had been sculpted since childhood.\n\n“Your cultivation is still low compared to the others,” LongChen said bluntly, “but it will suffice for now.”\n\nLin Mo exhaled. He knew that. The head of the Light Guard was nearing mid-Innate. The head of the Dark Guard, An Jing, was already there. Lin Mo was only at the initial stage of Innate. He was the weakest among them.\n\n“Be ready. Your mission begins tomorrow.”\n\n“Yes, Master.” Lin Mo hesitated, then asked, “What about An Jing?”\n\n“He’s already in Tianhai,” LongChen replied.\n\n“...I see.”\n\nJust the name sent a chill down Lin Mo’s spine.\n\nHe had seen LongChen fight only once, during the destruction of his village. It was a long time ago.\n\nBut he had seen An Jing in action more than once in recent times.\nAnd each time, it was terrifying.\n\nBoth Dark Guards and Hunters trained similarly, but An Jing’s strikes had a ruthless precision that Lin Mo feared he might never match.\n\n“Resolve any personal matters tonight,” LongChen said, turning to leave.\n\n“I will.”\n\nLin Mo watched his mentor vanish into the corridor.\n\nHe did have one personal matter to handle.\n\nAnd it couldn’t wait.",

            "content": "Soon, Lin Mo was ready to settle a long-overdue personal matter.\n\nIt wasn’t something particularly grand, not a war or political mission. It was just vengeance. Simple, personal vengeance. He was going to kill the man who had murdered his mother.\n\nFifteen years ago, when LongChen had descended upon the raiders that destroyed Lin Mo's village, he had intentionally spared one man, the killer of his mother. He left that man alive, beaten and broken, not out of mercy, but so Lin Mo could take justice into his own hands when the time was right.\n\nOver the years, Lin Mo had confronted him six times. Each time, he inflicted unimaginable damage, leaving the man teetering between life and death. If Lin Mo had truly wanted to end it, he could have done it very easily. But he didn’t. It was a cruel game of cat and mouse, a slow, calculated torment.\n\nBut now the game has lost its thrill.\n\nNow, it will end. Lin Mo had no patience left for mercy or hesitation.\n\nAt the central train station of the city, Gu Jun arrived. Here he will board a train for Tianhai.\n\nTo the average onlooker, he was alone, just another well-dressed youth preparing for a journey. But appearances were deceptive. Four people accompanied him, though almost no one would be able to spot them if they did not want to.\n\nThe first was An Jing, who had arrived separately to rendezvous. The other two were Yingchen and Yinglan, his shadows. And then there was the last, a masked woman, around twenty-four years old.\n\nShe was Di Yan, the personal bodyguard sent by Gu Jun’s mother.\n\nZi Feng believed her son was living a normal life, preparing for university. She had no idea about his current complicated situation. Six years ago, during the assassination attempt, all of the Zi family’s elite guards were slaughtered. Unaware of the true events, Zi Feng assumed the guards had protected her son successfully. So she also concentrates on taking revenge. And she was successful in taking control of the family.\n\nFollowing that incident, Di Yan had been assigned to watch over Gu Jun. Once a junior apprentice within the Zi family’s inner guard, she was now his designated protector.\n\nThough she lived in close proximity to him, she knew very little about his true situation. Gu Jun didn’t worry about her discovering anything. LongChen had arranged things carefully, ensuring her loyalty, even from his own mother.\n\nDespite her limited understanding of the situation, Di Yan was no ordinary guard. Her cultivation had reached the peak of the Dark Energy stage. Though Gu Jun considered it weak compared to his other companions, her strength was formidable by ordinary standards.\n\nIn an open field, she was nearly untouchable. Her agility and stealth made her almost impossible to catch. In a confined space, it would take a platoon of at least twenty well-armed soldiers with automatic rifles to bring her down. Even then, it wouldn't be easy. In the open, one would need machine guns just to slow her.\n\nThe story has been taken without consent; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\n\nEarth’s cultivation stages were structured, but unforgiving.\n\nThe first stage was Vitality Sensation, the gateway to cultivation. It enhanced physical ability five to ten times; strength, speed, and reflexes, just enough to outperform normal humans.\n\nNext came Bright Energy, where one could channel vitality outward. Practitioners could leap from five-story buildings, bend metal with their bare hands, and dodge bullets.\n\nDark Strength followed. Di Yan was currently at its peak. Here, practitioners could move with blinding speed, coat weapons in energy, and unleash ranged attacks of pure vitality. Telekinesis, enhanced senses, and energy projection became possible. Lifespan extended to roughly 150 years.\n\nThen came HuaJin, a stage few reached. To kill a HuaJin-level warrior required a company of at least two hundred elite soldiers with advanced weaponry. A single one could level a city block if provoked. The most powerful families might possess only a handful. For instance, the Xiao family had just seven HuaJin warriors. Their patriarch stood at the peak of this realm, with a lifespan nearing 225 years.\n\nAbove that loomed Innate, a realm where cultivators transcended the limits of the body and became forces of nature. Even the prestigious Zi family had only three Innate-level warriors, including their ancient patriarch, who was said to have reached the late stage.\n\nIn Country X, reaching the peak of Innate carried a heavy consequence: banishment from the mundane realm. Anyone breaking through was sent to the Sacred Garden, a hidden place where the nation's most powerful beings, the Supreme Protectors, resided in silence. They were barred from interfering in mortal affairs. They are too dangerous, too powerful. So they are also called the Humanoid calamities.\n\nThe country is very careful about them. Those people are humanoid disasters; only a nuclear weapon is effective against them, but it is not a complete sure kill, as they can hide themselves in the deeper dimension.\n\nThere were four known Peak Innates in Country X.\n\nIn the Gu Empire, there were three: the Right Protector, the Left Protector, and the Grand Elder.\n\nIt has a lifespan of 400 years, and most of Country X’s peak innates are old monsters.\n\nTheir only duty is to provide stability to the country and attempt to break through to the Divine Stage, a cultivation realm that has not appeared for thousands of years. It is said that Divine Stage warriors can leave Earth and travel to other planets in the solar system, but this remains uncertain, as no one has ever seen one. They are a mystery to others, but clearly not to Gu Jun.\n\nGu Jun boarded the train.\n\nHe stepped into a first-class compartment, noting that there were only ten passengers inside. Quiet. Perfect.\n\nAs he sat by the window, his thoughts turned inward, toward his own cultivation. Currently, he lingered at the bottom: Vitality Sensation. It was pitifully weak compared to what he needed to become.\n\nHe longed to improve. However, his path was unlike that of others. His breakthrough was harsh, nearly impossible without meeting certain conditions.\n\nAnd those conditions, unfortunately, were beyond his control, at least for now.",

            "content": "Gu Jun sat quietly in the first-class train compartment.\n\nThe train hadn’t departed yet, and just a few minutes remained before the journey began.\n\nThere were not many people on the first-class side of the train.\n\nSuddenly, the screech of tires broke the calm environment. A sleek black SUV pulled up just outside the station entrance. From it stepped two high-heeled young women, both strikingly beautiful. Trailing them were two well-built men in black suits, and by the look of them, they were bodyguards.\n\nGu Jun glanced at the bodyguards casually. In an instant, their cultivation levels appeared in his mind: peak of Bright Strength.\n\nThey followed the women into the first-class compartment and took their seats behind them. The two girls, meanwhile, sat directly across from Gu Jun.\n\nEven Gu Jun had to admit, they were stunning. The kind of beauty that turned heads without effort. The girls gave him a brief look before turning away, uninterested.\n\nThat, too, was expected. Gu Jun’s appearance was average at best, despite his remarkably good-looking parents. There was nothing remarkable in his face to draw their attention.\n\nHe didn’t care. However, his indifference made the girls glance at him again, just briefly, with faint curiosity. They were accustomed to admiration, not quiet disregard.\n\nUnbothered, Gu Jun pulled a worn paperback from his bag and began reading. The carriage fell into a comfortable hush.\n\nThe warmer, more outgoing of the two girls broke the silence first.\n\nShe said excitedly, “Cousin, wasn’t that vacation great? I told you that this place has the perfect balance of natural scenery and urban life.”\n\nHer cousin, colder and more reserved, nodded slightly. “It was nice.”\n\n“Come on, cousin, don’t be so stingy with your words,” she teased. “But you have to admit, it was the perfect break before the new semester.”\n\nThey kept chatting softly. Gu Jun didn’t listen. His focus was on the words on the page.\n\nJust then, three more people entered the compartment.\n\nOne was a tall, handsome young man with a practiced smile. The other two were clearly his bodyguards.\n\nThe man’s gaze swept the room before freezing in surprise as he spotted the two girls.\n\nEven a child could see he was faking it.\n\nHe strode over, all confident swagger.\n\n“Bai Yue! What a coincidence,” he said with forced enthusiasm. “Didn’t expect to see you on this train.”\n\nThe cold girl, Bai Yue, barely reacted. But her cousin narrowed her eyes.\n\n“Wang Wei, cut the act. We all know you’re stalking us. It’s creepy.”\n\nWang Wei grinned, undeterred. “You can think that if you like. But I’m not stalking you. I’m here for your cousin. It’s rare for someone like me to take time for someone, shouldn’t that show you how serious I am?”\n\nFind this and other great novels on the author's preferred platform. Support original creators!\n\n“Or how much of a pervert you are,” Rong Xi snapped.\n\n“Hey now, don’t slander me,” he shot back, still smiling. Then, turning to Bai Yue with a softer tone, “Since fate brought us together, why not talk a bit to pass the time?”\n\n“I have no time to pass,” Bai Yue said flatly. “Go and find your seat.”\n\nWang Wei’s smile vanished. He turned his attention to Gu Jun.\n\n“You. Get up. Go and sit somewhere else.”\n\nGu Jun didn’t even glance at him.\n\nWang Wei frowned. “I said, get up.”\n\nFinally, Gu Jun looked up, calm and expressionless. “I’m not moving. You should find another seat.”\n\nWang Wei pulled out a stack of bills and tossed them toward Gu Jun.\n\n“Take this. Go and sit somewhere else. I want to talk with these ladies, we are familiar.”\n\nRong Xi scoffed. “We’re not that familiar.”\n\nGu Jun blinked, baffled. Was this actually happening? It felt like a cliché from a bad soap opera, yet here it was, unfolding in real time, and he was also involved.\n\nThen, to his surprise, Rong Xi turned to him and ordered, “Don’t move. Stay right there.”\n\nGu Jun let out a faint laugh. He could tell these three all came from prominent families.\n\n“Alright,” he said with a small smile. “I’m not going anywhere.”\n\nWang Wei’s face darkened. “You’re making a mistake.”\n\nHis bodyguards stepped forward.\n\nSuddenly, Gu Jun felt the air shift. Heavy. Dangerous.\n\nDi Yan was reacting.\n\nThough she sat quietly nearby, masked and restrained, her presence surged. If she attacked, no one in the room, not even the bodyguards, would leave unscathed. They wouldn’t die, but they’d regret their decision to take action.\n\nBai Yue gave Wang Wei a sharp glare. She turned and signaled her own bodyguard.\n\nThe man stepped forward, tension in his stance.\n\n“Wang Wei,” she said coldly, “don’t make a scene. It won’t end well for you.”\n\nWang Wei hesitated. Then, as if remembering something, he backed off.\n\nHe looked at Gu Jun and said with forced calm, “We’ll meet again.”\n\nThen he turned and walked into the next compartment, his bodyguards trailing behind.\n\nGu Jun exhaled softly. Inwardly, he thought, You were one second away from getting destroyed.\n\nRong Xi grinned and turned to him. “Hey, you were brave. I’m Rong Xi from Tianhai. I am studying at Tianhai Royal University. What’s your name? Where are you from?”\n\n“Gu Jun,” he replied. “Freshman. Also Tianhai Royal University.”\n\n“Ohhh! So you’re my junior! Hurry up and call me ‘Senior Sister’!”\n\nGu Jun looked at her with a dry expression. “Senior Sister.”\n\n“Haha, good!” she laughed. “Stick with me, little brother. I’ll protect you!”\n\n“Okay, Senior Sister.”\n\nBai Yue looked at them with faint surprise, then turned to Gu Jun. “Be careful of Wang Wei. He’s not harmless. He’s also from Tianhai Royal University.”\n\nGu Jun nodded, his expression unreadable. The lack of emotion in his response made Bai Yue glance at him twice.\n\nRong Xi snorted. “He won’t dare mess with my junior. I’ll break his leg.”\n\nBai Yue gave her cousin a side glance and said, “Don’t act so aggressively all the time. You’re a girl, remember?”\n\nRong Xi shrugged with a grin. “Being a 'good girl' is boring.”\n\nGu Jun observed them quietly. It was becoming more and more clear that once she let her guard down, Rong Xi was anything but calm.\n\nJust then, the sharp sound of the train’s horn comes from the front.\n\nA moment later, the train began to move.",

            "content": "The train roared along the tracks, cutting through the countryside like a silver dragon. Inside, Gu Jun sat by the window, watching the blurry greens and browns of the landscape fly past. His reflection shimmered faintly on the glass; calm, collected, almost detached.\n\nAcross from him, Rong Xi was still talking; cheerful, animated, and unstoppable. She had no problem filling the silence with conversation, even when no one asked for it.\n\n\"I'm in my third year now,\" she was saying. \"Business Administration. Honestly, it's boring, but I’ll probably inherit part of the family business, so it can’t be helped.\"\n\nGu Jun listened politely, occasionally nodding, though his attention shifted to Bai Yue, who sat quietly beside her cousin. She was the opposite in every way; composed, elegant, and radiating an air of quiet pride. He hadn't expected her next words.\n\n“I’ve just joined the university,” she said calmly. “As a lecturer. English Department.”\n\nThat stunned him more than it should have. A lecturer? At such a young age?\n\nRong Xi rolled her eyes. “Don’t let her fool you. She just finished her master’s and got pulled in immediately. She’s always been the overachiever in the family.”\n\nAs the train continued its journey, Gu Jun caught snippets of their conversation, two names standing out like thunder in a clear sky: Rong Family. Bai Family.\n\nHe closed his eyes briefly, recalling what he knew about Tianhai's power structure.\n\nThe Xiao family sat at the top, unquestioned and unrivaled, with wealth and influence stretching into politics, business, and even the criminal underworld.\n\nBeneath them were five recognized first-class families. The Rong family, famous for their grip on real estate, ranked first among these. The Bai family, wealthy from their international trade empire, held the third spot. Combined, their estimated worth exceeded 600 billion yuan.\n\nThen he thought of Wang Wei as well. That arrogant young master from earlier had to be from the Wang family, a name that surfaced often in both business and darker dealings. On the surface, they owned chains of casinos, entertainment hubs, and resorts. Beneath that glittering exterior, they ran the Green Gang, the second-most powerful underworld gang in Tianhai.\n\nThe number one gang? That belonged to the Xiao family, controlling a full 60% of the city’s underworld.\n\nThe remaining 40% was split between the Green Gang and the Imperial Bull Gang, controlled by the Hong family, a relatively new power. Though fresh to the game, the Hong family had risen meteorically. Gu Jun knew why; the Gu Empire backed them completely. Word in the planning council was clear: if the Xiao family went rogue, the Hong family would become Tianhai’s new ruling clan.\n\nThis plan, of course, was gradual and had some calculation and complication, but the direction was firm.\n\nGu Jun also recalled that elements of the Rong family had been quietly aligning themselves with Gu Empire-friendly factions, hinting at deeper cooperation.\n\nAs the train neared Tianhai Central Station, the compartment buzzed with movement. Passengers gathered their belongings, standing up and adjusting coats and bags. Bai Yue gently closed her tablet. Rong Xi yawned and stretched, her energy finally dimming.\n\nWhen the train came to a halt, the trio stepped out into the warm summer air.\n\nThis story originates from a different website. Ensure the author gets the support they deserve by reading it there.\n\nThey said their goodbyes with polite formality; after all, they would inevitably meet again at Tianhai Royal University.\n\nOnce alone, Gu Jun pulled out his phone and dialed Uncle Tang.\n\nHe was a close friend of his father, and Gu Jun suspected that Tang’s smooth rise through the government bureaucracy was due to his mother, Zi Feng. He had always treated Gu Jun with genuine warmth.\n\n“Uncle Tang,” Gu Jun said when the call connected. “I’ve arrived.”\n\n“I’ll be there soon,” Tang replied. “Don’t go far.”\n\nGu Jun nodded to no one and began crossing the plaza in front of the station. Then he heard shouting behind him.\n\n“Hey! Boy! Stop!”\n\nHe turned and saw Wang Wei, flanked by his two bodyguards, storming out of the station and rushing across the road toward him. Their expressions were hostile, full of righteous indignation, and bruised ego.\n\nThen it happened.\n\nFrom a nearby underground parking garage, a heavily modified SUV, painted matte black, with tinted windows that reflected nothing, burst out with a deep growl.\n\nIt moved like a predator straight toward Wang Wei.\n\nThe bodyguards froze.\n\n“Young Master! Look out!” one yelled.\n\nOne guard rushed to block the vehicle with his body, a desperate move, but the only one he had. The other tried to shield Wang Wei.\n\nIt was useless.\n\nThe SUV hit the first guard and launched him ten meters into the air. Bones cracked audibly. The second guard and Wang Wei were swept aside like bowling pins. They landed in a heap by the roadside, screaming in pain. Blood dripped from cuts and open fractures.\n\nPeople nearby screamed.\n\nBut Gu Jun wasn’t looking at them.\n\nHe was looking at the taillights of the disappearing vehicle. Or more precisely, hearing something.\n\nA soft, wicked laugh.\n\nRong Xi.\n\nShe had been waiting. Waiting to see if Wang Wei would try something stupid, and she had acted first.\n\nReckless, dangerous, and audacious.\n\nGu Jun smirked. She had truly taken her self-declared role as senior sister seriously. Though her family held power, attacking the Wang heir so openly would certainly provoke a response. But Gu Jun wasn’t worried. If needed, someone in the Gu Empire would handle the backlash. If the Wang family tried to escalate things... they'd be reminded where the true line of power lay.\n\nFrom the pavement, Wang Wei and his guards looked at the disappearing SUV, then at Gu Jun with unmistakable hatred.\n\nThey knew who had triggered this humiliation.\n\nA horn.\n\nA sleek government car pulled up beside Gu Jun. The rear door opened, and a man in his fifties stepped out, dressed in a crisp summer suit.\n\n“Well, look at you,” he said with a grin. “I haven’t seen you in two years, and now you’re already in university. Time flies.”\n\n“Hello, Uncle,” Gu Jun greeted with a slight nod. “I’m doing well.”\n\n“Good. Don’t stand around in the sun. Let’s get in.”\n\nInside the car sat a young girl, no older than fifteen, wearing a school uniform and earbuds. She eyed Gu Jun with mild curiosity.\n\n“Gu Jun, meet my youngest daughter, Tang Xin,” Uncle Tang said. “Tang Xin, say hello to your brother.”\n\nTang Xin looked at him, scrutinized him head to toe, then said bluntly, “I haven’t seen you in two years. I thought you’d grow up handsome. But you’re still just... ordinary.”\n\nGu Jun blinked.\n\n“Another spicy girl,” he thought, amused.\n\nAnd with that, the car pulled into the bustling streets of Tianhai, a city of dynasties, ambition, and dangerous games.\n\nAuthor Note: Hey everyone!

            "content": "Tianhai City shimmered outside the car window like a jewel carved into steel and glass.\n\nGu Jun leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on the vibrant blur of lights, people, and skyscrapers that stretched endlessly into the horizon. Towering buildings gleamed in the afternoon sun, their reflections mirrored on the polished roads. The city pulsed with energy, wealth, ambition, and hidden tension. A far cry from the quiet countryside where he spent most of his childhood.\n\nFrom the driver’s seat, Uncle Tang’s voice broke the silence.\n\n“When do your university classes start?”\n\nGu Jun blinked, shifting his gaze. “The day after tomorrow.”\n\nUncle Tang nodded thoughtfully. “And your accommodation? You know, you’re always welcome to stay with us. But if you'd prefer the university hostel for more independence, that’s fine too.”\n\nGu Jun smiled faintly. “Thank you, Uncle. I’ll probably stay at the hostel most of the time, but I’ll visit often. I might even rent a small place near campus later on.”\n\nUncle Tang grunted in approval. “Good. Still, don’t worry too much about it, I’ve already made arrangements.”\n\nGu Jun wasn’t surprised. It had his mother’s touch written all over it. She must have discussed every possible scenario with Uncle Tang.\n\nHe turned to the girl beside him. “So, how’s your day going, Tang Xin?”\n\nFrom beside him, Tang Xin stretched with a theatrical sigh. “Ugh. My day’s been so boring. I’m not allowed to go out alone. All my friends are running wild while I’m stuck at home like some tragic heroine.”\n\nShe turned to him suddenly, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “But now that you’re here, Gu Jun, things are going to change. Your main job from today is to keep me entertained. I’ll show you what real fun means.”\n\nUncle Tang glanced at her through the rearview mirror with an annoyed expression.\n\n“Hey, old man,” she teased, “don’t give me that look. I finally have a trusted male companion. You can’t stop me from enjoying life anymore.”\n\nGu Jun chuckled. “I’m fine with that, as long as Uncle and Aunt Tang approve.”\n\n“Hah! See? You’re not as useless as you look!” she grinned.\n\n“Be polite,” Uncle Tang said dryly.\n\nThe car pulled into the driveway of a large, elegant house in the quieter residential district of Tianhai. Inside, the air was cool and scented faintly with jasmine. Two maids stood at attention near the door. Aunt Tang greeted them with a polite smile, but her gaze toward Gu Jun was formal.\n\n“It’s been a long time,” she said. “How are you? I heard you got into Tianhai Royal University. That’s quite an accomplishment. If your parents were alive… they would have been very proud.”\n\nDid you know this text is from a different site? Read the official version to support the creator.\n\n“Thank you, Aunt,” Gu Jun said quietly.\n\nShe gave a stiff nod. “After going to the university, concentrate on your education, don't waste this opportunity. Tianhai Royal University is one of the two best universities in the country. It is very rare to get this chance.”\n\nLooking at her, Gu Jun knew that she wanted to add something, but at the last minute, she stopped. She wanted to say that it was a great chance from heaven for a fatherless and motherless child like him.\n\nAfter all, she didn't know the identity of his mother. Uncle Tang had taken an oath not to reveal it. To Aunt Tang, his mother had a very ordinary background, and, moreover, she was believed to be dead.\n\nStill, the subtle shift in Aunt Tang’s attitude was new. She had always been distant, but now there was quiet disapproval in her voice.\n\nGu Jun did not care. After nodding slightly, he followed the maid to his room.\n\nThe room was spacious, its decor elegant but understated. After a quick shower, he stepped out, drying his hair with a towel, then paused.\n\nHe felt it. A presence. Quiet, controlled, but unnatural.\n\nAlthough his cultivation level was low, Gu Jun had excellent instincts and some super treasures. He stood still as a figure slowly emerged from the corner of the room, stepping from the shadows like smoke dispersing into form.\n\nThe man gave a medium bow. He wore plain black robes, yet his presence was sharp and commanding.\n\n“Greetings, Your Highness,” he said solemnly. “I am Lin Mo, Head of the Hunters. I respectfully report for duty.”\n\nGu Jun studied him silently. There was a calm professionalism in Lin Mo’s face, but in his eyes, something burned. It was reverence, devotion, perhaps even fanaticism.\n\nInteresting.\n\n“You look tired,” Gu Jun remarked.\n\nLin Mo gave a small bow of apology. “There were minor complications before the transition to the city. They’ve been handled.”\n\nGu Jun waved a hand, and like a ripple in space, Lin Mo vanished.\n\nTruth be told, Gu Jun thinks that it is too much to have so many companions, but he has no other choice.\n\nHis twin shadow was a top secret. Only three top innates of the Gu Empire knew about them. Aside from those three, he obviously had other trump cards. But as an emperor's heir, he had to obey some rules so that all the other officials felt secure and stable.\n\nGu Jun also took a mental note to look at Lin Mo’s file. After that, he put on his clothes and came out of the room. From the drawing room, he could hear the sound of laughter. There were several male and female laughs ringing loudly, and a lively, elegant energy filled the space.\n\nInside, four women and two men sat around a polished table. The women were Aunt Tang, Tang Xin, and two others. One of them immediately caught his attention. She looked familiar—elegant, poised, and beautiful. Gu Jun recognized her as Tang Mei, Uncle Tang’s eldest daughter.\n\nShe had matured into a graceful woman, now a student at Tianhai Royal University like him.\n\nThe others were similarly refined, young women with clear skin, fashionable clothes. She is very beautiful, near Bai Yue’s level. She was an elite and likely powerful person in her own right.\n\nGu Jun didn’t recognize her.\n\nAunt Tang looked up as he entered. “Gu Jun, come join us. You should remember my daughter, Tang Mei. The others are her close friends from school. They’re all studying at Tianhai Royal University.”\n\nShe turned back to the girls. “This is Gu Jun, son of a dear friend of my husband.\"\n\nGu Jun gave a light nod.",

            "content": "All eyes turned to Gu Jun as he stepped into the elegantly furnished sitting room. Conversations halted, replaced by measured stares. One by one, the young men and women seated around the room offered polite greetings, verbal gestures as hollow as the social rituals that bound them.\n\n“Hello,” someone said with a faint smile.\n\nOne of the boys leaned back in his chair, crossing one leg over the other with deliberate casualness. His gaze was sharp, his posture just arrogant enough to signal confidence. “So you’re Gu Jun,” he said, voice edged with skepticism. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”\n\nNow Gu Jun understood why Aunt Tang seemed cold. Uncle Tang, being close to both his parents, likely hoped to match him with one of his daughters, most likely the elder, Tang Mei. But Aunt Tang clearly disapproved. To her, he was just a rural boy who got lucky enough to enter a prestigious university, worthy of some respect, perhaps, but not good enough for her daughter.\n\nTypical dog-blood drama.\n\nAmused and slightly annoyed, Gu Jun answered, “Really? What exactly have you heard?” He now realized that this boy likes Tang Mei.\n\nThe boy blinked, taken aback by the unexpected boldness in the reply. He had expected stammering humility or awkward thanks, not this sharpness.\n\nOne of the girls, seated near the window with a cup of tea in hand, laughed outright. Her hair was immaculate, her skin radiant, her posture regal. She radiated an air of confidence only long exposure to social admiration could grant. She tossed her hair with practiced grace, locking eyes with him.\n\nGu Jun studied her carefully. Her aura felt familiar, not the cultivation kind, but something in the bones, in the presence. A rhythm he’d seen before. Then it clicked.\n\n“You look a lot like my girlfriend,” he said casually, as if stating the weather.\n\nHer smile paused. “Excuse me?”\n\n“You’re from Tianhai Royal University, right?” he continued, voice smooth as velvet. “Then you must know her. Her name is Bai Yue.”\n\nThe air in the room thickened like sudden fog. Jaws tightened, spines straightened, and glances passed like whispers. The girl’s fingers froze around her teacup.\n\nThen she smirked. “You’re clever. You know who I am, and you know who my sister is. What exactly is your goal here?”\n\nGu Jun leaned against the side of a nearby cabinet, utterly at ease. “No research. Just a memory. And honesty. I’m not playing games; I am dating your sister. Which, by my calculations, makes you my sister-in-law.”\n\nHer smirk vanished. “That’s impossible.”\n\n“Is it?” he asked, tilting his head slightly. “Then let’s test it. Where’s your sister right now?”\n\n“She’s… away. On vacation.”\n\nGu Jun chuckled softly. “You’re behind on the news. She’s already back in Tianhai. In fact, we returned together, me, Bai Yue, and Rong Xi. You know her, too, don’t you? We’re all quite close.”\n\nHer expression tightened, her eyes flicking briefly to her companions, who were now looking increasingly uncomfortable.\n\nHe continued, tone measured, but heavy with implication. “This last vacation, your sister didn’t just travel. She came to my village. Things got… well, let’s say a little emotional. So now, I am preparing to take responsibility for my actions. We’re announcing our engagement soon.”\n\nIf you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\n\nThe girl’s lips parted slightly. She looked at Gu Jun in disbelief, then was stunned into silence.\n\n“You’re lying.”\n\nGu Jun looked at her and said, “You still do not believe me. Actually, you can ask your sister. Oh, I forgot to add, Wang Wei was on the train. He wanted to harass Bai Yue, so I slapped him. He was very angry and tried to attack me at the train station. So Bai Yue was angry. She ordered the driver to hit Wang Wei. I am a little concerned about this issue.”\n\nSomeone in the room gasped.\n\n“You’re joking,” Bai Xue said sharply, but her voice lacked conviction.\n\n“Am I?” Gu Jun shrugged. “You have a phone. Check it. I’d love to know if there are any new developments. Frankly, I’m worried about the backlash myself.”\n\nReluctantly, she pulled out her phone and began scrolling, fingers twitching as she navigated her elite network’s gossip channel. A few seconds later, her eyes widened, mouth slightly open. She scrolled faster, clicked a few images, photos of Bai Yue at the station, a short video of Wang Wei shouting angrily, a blurred image of a car speeding off.\n\nHer composure shattered.\n\n“You… really are her boyfriend.”\n\nGu Jun nodded solemnly. “Yes. And, technically, your brother-in-law.”\n\nShe looked away, biting her lip.\n\n“Hmph. It’s not so easy to earn that title. You will have to face many tests and tribulations.”\n\n“I agree,” Gu Jun said mildly. “But since Bai Yue chose me, maybe give her some face. It doesn’t cost much to call me ‘Brother-in-law,’ does it?”\n\nThere was a long silence. Then she muttered, under her breath, “Brother-in-law…”\n\nA smile tugged at the corner of Gu Jun’s mouth. The social theater unfolding in front of him was almost too easy. This was one of his greatest strengths, one of the finest non-cultivation techniques he’d honed over the years: psychological manipulation. Every gesture, every phrase, every pause was calculated to stir emotion, to destabilize opposition, to bend people gently toward his narrative. He didn’t need force; he needed belief. And belief came from performance.\n\nHe could feel it now, the subtle ripple in the air, his twin shadows, his hidden guardians, watching from their invisible perches. Among them, one pulse of anger stood out: Di Yan.\n\nGu Jun turned back to the girl. “So, sister-in-law… what’s your name?”\n\nStill dazed, she answered, “Bai Xue.”\n\n“Nice to meet you properly, Bai Xue.” He paused for effect. “What’s the current status on the Wang family side?”\n\nBai Xue straightened, indignation finally bubbling up in her voice. “You’ve caused a huge mess. The Wang family is furious. Most of the pressure is falling on Rong Xi, but Bai Yue is also being dragged into it.”\n\nGu Jun raised an eyebrow, but shrugged dramatically with a helpless look. “What can I say? Bai Yue loves me too much. And I have my suspicions that Rong Xi might, too. Women do wild things when they're in love with someone… exceptional.”\n\nThe room collectively choked on silence. One of the boys looked at Gu Jun with fire in his eyes, as if this were another place, he would have already punched him. Others had disgusted looks on their faces. Gu Jun remained serenely indifferent.\n\nAt that moment, the door opened and Uncle Tang entered the room. He paused, eyes scanning the group. He seemed immediately aware of the odd, tense atmosphere; after all, he had a rich social experience.\n\n“What’s going on here?” he asked lightly. Then he turned to Gu Jun, his voice warm. “Have you seen my daughter Tang Mei yet?”\n\nGu Jun smiled, bowing his head slightly. “Ah, Sister Tang Mei. I was just about to greet her. Sister Tang Mei, how have you been?”\n\nAll eyes turned to Tang Mei. She stood near the far side of the room, half-shadowed by a tall, arched window. Her expression was carefully neutral, but her eyes betrayed a storm of emotion, frustration, confusion, and resentment.\n\nShe had resisted her father’s matchmaking plans for months. To her, the idea of marrying some obscure boy from a backward village had been insulting. But now? Now the boy she had rejected as beneath her had a powerful girlfriend.\n\nShe opened her mouth to speak, hesitated, and then said simply, “Welcome to the Tang residence.”\n\nGu Jun gave her a graceful nod. “Thank you. I’m honored.”",

            "content": "Uncle Tang looked at the group, his eyes sweeping over their varied expressions, some blank, others still struggling to process what they had just heard.\n\nHe gave a faint smile. “So, all of you are here,” he said in a calm, even tone. “Let’s go. I’ve booked a restaurant for dinner.”\n\n“Thank you, Uncle,” a few of them replied.\n\nThey filed out of the house. Only Uncle Tang and Gu Jun looked composed. The rest walked like actors between scenes; silent, confused, and awkward. A few steps behind, two boys shot Gu Jun resentful glances, their fists clenched just enough to reveal the growing hostility inside.\n\nAfter all, the cold goddess of Tianhai Royal University, Bai Yue, had been taken. And not by someone from their world of polished shoes. No. She had chosen him. A village boy.\n\nSoon, they entered the restaurant Uncle Tang had reserved. A sleek Western-style venue with velvet seats, candle-lit tables, and a private room already prepared. Waiters in black-and-white uniforms greeted them with subtle bows.\n\nUncle Tang remained mostly silent during the meal. He listened to the conversations but said little. His eyes occasionally rested on Gu Jun with a faint, unreadable look, half approval, half regret.\n\nHe already knew most of what had happened. His sources were fast. He had received word not long after the train incident. He wasn’t pleased, but he wasn’t surprised either. Gu Jun’s mother, Zi Feng, was no ordinary woman. Her will wasn’t something just anyone could casually oppose, not even someone like him.\n\nThere’s no telling what Zi Feng has already planned for him. If she’s already decided on his marriage, no matter whether it is for my daughter or someone from the Bai family, the outcome will not change. My Mei’er… she never stood much of a chance.\n\nStill, a father can dream.\n\nAfter dinner, Uncle Tang and his wife returned to the house, leaving the younger group to entertain themselves.\n\nThey headed for a nearby bowling alley, its neon lights flashing faintly beneath the night sky. Laughter and music spilled from the glass doors. Inside, the atmosphere was bright and loud, a stark contrast to the tension that had hung in the air all evening.\n\nGu Jun sat off to the side, watching the others bowl half-heartedly. He had no real interest in the game. Instead, he sat casually on a sofa in the lounge area, arms relaxed. On either side of him were Bai Xue and Tang Xin, both pretending not to be too interested in him, while their eyes kept drifting toward him with thinly veiled curiosity.\n\n“So tell me honestly,” Bai Xue finally said, raising an eyebrow. “How did you convince my sister? Did you bribe her? Threaten her? Use blackmail?”\n\nTang Xin giggled. “Yes, yes! Brother Gu Jun, I’m a huge fan of Sister Bai Yue, too. She’s like… untouchable! And you, well, you’re not bad-looking, but you’re not that guy, you know? There are guys with family backgrounds and genius talent lining up behind her. What did you do to her?”\n\nGu Jun looked at them and smiled lazily. “Girls, have some respect. One of you is my sister-in-law, and the other is like a sister to me. Is this how you talk to family?”\n\nThe two girls rolled their eyes in unison and snorted.\n\nBai Xue narrowed her eyes. “Stop dodging. What really happened? You cast some kind of spell?”\n\nGu Jun leaned back further. “If you want details, ask Bai Yue herself. But since you’re curious, I’ll tell you one thing.” He paused, letting the silence stretch. “I didn’t pursue her. She pursued me.”\n\nBoth girls stared at him for a second before bursting into laughter.\n\n“Hah! Stop lying, brother-in-law,” Bai Xue said, shaking her head.\n\nThe author's content has been appropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.\n\n“Impossible,” Tang Xin added, giggling. “You’re just a normal guy. Village boy, barely eighteen… what, you saved her from a bandit in the mountains or something?”\n\n“I can’t help it if the truth sounds unbelievable,” Gu Jun said with a shrug, expression perfectly innocent.\n\nTo his surprise, Gu Jun found himself enjoying the moment. It was rare, this light teasing, this playful banter. Although he was the same age as them, his soul had been shaped in a crucible of strict discipline and relentless training. For someone like him, small slices of youthful normalcy like this felt almost like a luxury.\n\nThe laughter. The challenge. The disbelief. It was all strangely refreshing.\n\nEventually, they finished their games and stepped out of the bowling alley.\n\nBut not everyone was smiling.\n\nThe two boys from earlier still looked at Gu Jun with unconcealed resentment. Now, Gu Jun stood not only as a rival but as someone who had already won.\n\nGu Jun already knew the identities of the two boys who had been eyeing him with veiled hostility.\n\nOne of them was Yang Ling, a direct descendant of the Yang family, one of Tianhai’s five First-Class Families. The Yangs were a purely judicial clan; generations of judges, prosecutors, and legal scholars. While their military and financial strength were not particularly impressive compared to the others, their influence in the legal system made them one of the most stable power bases in the city. What they lacked in force, they made up for in resilience and institutional roots.\n\nThe other was Su Yuchen, son of Major General Su Bai, the third-highest commander in the Tianhai Military Region. Gu Jun recalled that Su Bai had long served as one of Zi Feng’s most trusted people. Di Yan maintained regular contact with him.\n\nFrom the way Yang Ling acted around Tang Mei, the subtle looks, the unnecessary helpfulness, the attempts at quiet closeness, it was clear to Gu Jun that he had a crush on her.\n\nFinished with the evening’s performance, Gu Jun quietly excused himself and left.\n\nHe hailed a taxi and told the driver to take him to a quiet corner near Tianhai Royal University, a small, inconspicuous coffee shop nestled between two bookstores. The kind of place frequented by students and professors, hidden enough to serve as a discreet meeting point.\n\nAs he stepped inside, the soft hum of conversation greeted him. But within minutes, the energy shifted.\n\nThe barista became stiff. The few customers inside hastily finished their drinks. One by one, they stood up and left, as if following an invisible command.\n\nIn less than ten minutes, Gu Jun was the only person remaining.\n\nHe sat by the window, slowly lighting one of his Imperial Cigarettes, its fragrance faintly herbal with a sharp undertone.\n\nNot long after, the bell above the door jingled.\n\nTwo men entered.\n\nThe first walked with crisp, purposeful steps. Around thirty years old, well-groomed, his presence both sharp and deferential. This was the Ninth Elder of the Gu Empire, one of the Three Executors overseeing the Tianhai Plan.\n\nBehind him walked an older man, perhaps in his fifties. Though his expression was careful, Gu Jun caught the flickers in his eyes, reverence, fear, excitement, and something else... a touch of fanaticism.\n\nBoth men stopped at a respectful distance from his table.\n\nThe Ninth Elder bowed slightly. “Greetings, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun nodded once, exhaling a lazy stream of smoke. Then he turned his gaze to the older man.\n\n“Who is he?”\n\nThe Ninth Elder answered promptly. “This is Hong Biao, current leader of the Imperial Bull Gang.”\n\nHong Biao kept his head low, but Gu Jun could feel his eyes studying him, searching for confirmation, clinging to myth and legend made flesh.\n\n“I see,” Gu Jun said flatly, before glancing out the window.\n\nAfter a pause, he asked, “What’s the current situation?”\n\n“Everything proceeds as expected,” replied the Ninth Elder. “Your influence in Tianhai is growing in the shadows.”\n\nGu Jun nodded again, slowly flicking ash into the tray. “Keep your eyes on the Yang family. I want to know if they’re interacting with my mother. Track any shift in their judicial appointments, family gatherings, and private meetings. Discreetly.”\n\n“As you command.”\n\nHe turned toward Hong Biao and spoke with a lazy half-smile. “And you…”\n\nHong Biao straightened slightly, sweat beginning to form at the edge of his brow.\n\n“I might drop by the Imperial Bull Gang sometime,” Gu Jun said, his voice casual. “If I get bored.”\n\nHong Biao bowed deeply. “It would be our greatest honor, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun gave no reply. He simply took another drag from his cigarette, his gaze returning to the fading lights outside the window.",

            "content": "Sometime later, Gu Jun stepped out of the coffee house.\n\nWith nothing urgent on his agenda, he wandered the streets of Tianhai City aimlessly. His hands tucked in his pockets, his gaze drifted from passing cars to neon signs. The city’s pulse beat around him, but he walked like a shadow, unhurried, unseen.\n\nBefore long, he heard the familiar sound of soft, measured footsteps behind him.\n\n“You seem to be enjoying yourself more than usual,” came Di Yan’s voice from behind, cool and teasing.\n\nGu Jun didn’t respond. He just kept walking.\n\nTwo hours passed like this, quietly, uneventfully. Eventually, he returned to the Tang residence.\n\nThe next day was simple and uneventful.\n\nTang Xin dragged him out to explore the city, ice cream stalls, a noisy arcade, and a rooftop café that she swore had the best view in town. Gu Jun went along silently, indulging her chatter with a rare smile here and there. Despite himself, he didn’t mind it.\n\nFinally, the day of the university’s opening arrived.\n\nDressed neatly in a casual yet sharp outfit, Gu Jun stepped into the waiting car outside the Tang residence. The ride to Tianhai Royal University took around half an hour, and he spent most of it staring out the window, lost in thought.\n\nThe car pulled up to the university gates.\n\nGu Jun stepped out and stood still for a moment, looking at the grand archway overhead. Students bustled past him, laughing, shouting, taking photos. Youthful energy filled the air.\n\nThis was a new world for him.\n\nDespite his status and training, Gu Jun had spent most of his life in isolation, disciplined, watched, and prepared. Coming to university was a deliberate choice. He wanted to experience something close to normalcy. A slice of the life he was never allowed to have.\n\nHe arrived early. There was no rush.\n\nHis major was philosophy. After a few minutes of wandering across the vast campus, he found the Philosophy Faculty, a tall, stately building with granite columns and an air of quiet dignity.\n\nIt took some effort to find the faculty office, especially without anyone familiar with the university guiding him, but he didn’t mind. He preferred it this way.\n\nHe stepped into the office, completed the registration and orientation paperwork, and exited shortly after with everything in order.\n\nThere were no classes today. Tomorrow will be the official inauguration ceremony. Actual lectures would begin the day after.\n\nLater that day, Gu Jun arrived at his dormitory. Dormitory No. 3\n\nIt was a shared space for five students.\n\nIf you encounter this story on Amazon, note that it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.\n\nTwo of them had already arrived.\n\nOne was tall, around six feet, with a strong build that suggested years of disciplined martial training. His presence was grounded and steady, like a rock in a storm.\n\nThe other was of average height, about five feet six, but strikingly handsome, with sharp eyes and a lazy smile. A dangerous charm lingered beneath his relaxed demeanor.\n\nGu Jun gave him an assessing look.\n\nBright Stage, peak level.\nHe can break into the Dark Stage at any time.\n\nInteresting.\n\nThe tall one caught Gu Jun's attention as well. Although he didn’t appear to possess any cultivation, there was something about his temperament, his presence, that made Gu Jun instinctively feel he had a strong affinity for cultivation. A good psych, as the experts would say.\n\nEach dorm room housed five students. So far, three had arrived, including Gu Jun himself. He also knew one of the two remaining students would be his Bright Guard, a protector assigned to him in public.\n\nHe nodded to both of them, neither friendly nor cold. He placed his bag down and took a seat on the lower bunk, quietly observing the room and its occupants.\n\nThe tall boy approached first, extending a hand with a friendly smile.\n\n“Hey there! I’m Zhao Ming, from Jin Province. You?”\n\n“Gu Jun,” he replied simply, taking the handshake but offering nothing more.\n\nMoments later, the handsome boy beside them stepped forward, also offering a handshake.\n\n“I’m Zhou Hao, from Yang Province. Nice to meet you both.”\n\nTheir introductions were interrupted as the door creaked open and another figure entered.\n\nThe fourth roommate was unremarkable at first glance, slightly under average height, modestly dressed, with a mature air despite his youthful face. He looked to be in his twenties, though his demeanor was far more composed than the average university student.\n\nGu Jun’s eyes sharpened.\nLi Ming, his Bright Guard.\n\nAs if on cue, Li Ming walked in, glanced briefly at the others, then bowed slightly in Gu Jun’s direction. The bow wasn’t overly formal, just enough to signal respect without raising suspicion.\n\nGu Jun responded with a calm nod.\n\nZhao Ming raised a brow. “Uh, are you from around here? Is bowing a thing where you’re from?”\n\nLi Ming didn’t respond directly. Instead, he turned to the group and said flatly, “I’m Li Ming.”\n\nLike Gu Jun, he kept his introduction short and neutral. The others exchanged brief glances at the odd formality, but no one pressed further. It wasn’t unusual for quiet types to keep to themselves early on.\n\n“So we’re four now,” Zhao Ming said, glancing around. “Only one left.”\n\nJust as the words left his mouth, a commotion erupted outside the dorm, giggling, squealing, and unmistakable female voices.\n\nThen the door flew open, and in stepped the final roommate.\n\nHe was... striking.\n\nThe boy looked like he had just walked off a magazine cover. Perfectly styled hair, smooth skin, a defined jawline, and a confidence that oozed from every step. Though he was just under six feet tall, he carried himself like a celebrity.\n\nHe muttered to himself while peeking through the hallway peephole. “These girls are insane... but what can I say? Handsome people have it tough.”\n\nFinally noticing the others, he turned around with an easy smile.\n\n“Yo! I’m Xiao Wei. Looks like we’ll be living together.”\n\nHis tone was light, almost playful. There wasn’t an ounce of awkwardness in his demeanor, only the confidence of someone used to being the center of attention.\n\nZhao Ming blinked. “Uh... nice to meet you?”\n\nZhou Hao gave a quiet chuckle.\n\nGu Jun simply watched, quietly evaluating.\n\nThe dorm was full, and everybody was there.",

            "content": "After sunset, the students of Dormitory No. 3 went out for a drink.\n\nIt was their first time together outside the dorm, so things started a bit stiff. The conversation was cautious, filled with polite smiles and careful words. But they were young, and young people rarely stay strangers for long, especially when someone like Xiao Wei was around.\n\nXiao Wei, as always, played the role of the bug in the system, the kind that breaks the ice, breaks the rules, and never shuts up. He joked, teased, and acted just exaggerated enough to get people laughing. Even Gu Jun, who normally stayed detached, found himself occasionally smiling.\n\nBut he didn’t let his amusement distract him from what mattered.\n\nGu Jun studied Xiao Wei carefully. On the surface, he was all talk, lazy smiles and shallow charm, but behind that carefree attitude was someone dangerous. His cultivation was at the peak of the Bright Stage, just a step away from the Dark Stage. That alone told Gu Jun everything he needed to know: Xiao Wei wasn’t some pampered young master. He was a weapon, wrapped in silk.\n\nThe Xiao Family of Tianhai had many branches, but Xiao Wei’s bloodline came from the second son of the patriarch. That side of the family was known for walking a neutral line in politics, balancing influence from both the court and the military. They are also neutral regarding the issue of the Gu Empire. Though publicly considered a good-for-nothing, Xiao Wei had clearly been raised in the shadows, protected and prepared.\n\nOnly those who could see through the veil would ever recognize his true nature. If you want to see through others' cultivation, you at least have to be at the peak of Huajin. Fortunately, Gu Jun was able to see through him despite not having the proper cultivation.\n\nStill, Xiao Wei didn’t seem like a schemer. There was an honest playfulness in his manner, the kind that wasn’t faked. He might have been trained in silence, but he liked loud things, loud jokes, loud laughs, loud fun.\n\nThen there was Zhou Hao. Calm, polite, and easygoing. But Gu Jun could feel the quiet power behind him. His guard, hidden in the distance, was already at the peak of the initial Dark Stage. Stronger than Xiao Wei’s guard, who has just broken through to the dark level. That alone said a lot. Zhou Hao might not carry a family name like “Xiao,” but his background had to be just as deep, perhaps even deeper.\n\nThis dormitory... wasn’t simple.\n\nA moment of silence passed between them as they sat at an open-air café. Drinks arrived. Snacks. Casual chatter filled the air. Zhao Ming talked about his hometown. Xiao Wei boasted about how many love letters he had received since middle school. Zhou Hao nodded and smiled, enjoying the show.\n\nThen, as if remembering something important, Xiao Wei suddenly leaned forward with a wicked grin.\n\n“Hey, did you guys hear? There’s been a change in the Flower Rankings.”\n\nZhao Ming looked up. “What flower rankings?”\n\n“You don’t know?” Xiao Wei’s expression turned scandalized. “How can you attend Tianhai Royal University and not know about the Top Ten Flower Ranking?”\n\nZhou Hao chuckled. “You mean the unofficial list of the most beautiful girls in school?”\n\nTaken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.\n\n“Unofficial?” Xiao Wei scoffed. “It’s more official than the university administration. Every year, students vote, argue, and campaign. It's a sacred tradition. And not just looks, personality, grades, family background, and influence. It all counts.”\n\nZhao Ming looked genuinely intrigued now. “So what changed?”\n\nThere are two reigning queens on the list,” Xiao Wei began, with a dramatic flair in his voice. “One is the cold queen, and the other is the soft queen.”\n\n“The cold queen is Bai Yue. She just completed her master's and is now working as a junior lecturer. Stunningly beautiful, academically brilliant, she’s won multiple national and international awards for her research. Oh, and she was also the student council president.”\n\nHe leaned in slightly. “And there’s more, she’s the eldest daughter of the Bai family.”\n\nAlthough he did not know much about the Bai family, Zhao Ming whistled. “Impressive.”\n\nXiao Wei nodded. “Now, the soft queen is Xia Qingyue. A literal daughter of heaven. She’s in the arts department, currently starting her fourth year. You’ve probably heard her name: singer, actress, and now a top-tier supermodel. Just last week, the United Nations named her a peace ambassador.”\n\nZhou Hao raised an eyebrow. “Two queens, huh?”\n\n“Yup. Bai Yue used to hold the number one spot, while Xia Qingyue was second. Their beauty is on par, but Bai Yue’s family background and strong personality kept her in first place, until recently.”\n\n“What changed?” Gu Jun asked quietly, though he already had an idea.\n\n“Well,” Xiao Wei said, tapping his tablet, “Xia Qingyue’s father just got promoted; he’s now a standing committee member in the Tianhai provincial government. Add that to her rising fame, and her fan base exploded. They’ve been campaigning hard to get her to the top.”\n\n“So, who’s number one now?” Zhao Ming asked.\n\nXiao Wei smirked. “Both. After lots of ‘negotiation,’ the decision was made to have a tie. Bai Yue and Xia Qingyue now share the number one spot.”\n\nZhao Ming leaned forward. “I’ve seen Xia Qingyue; she really is insanely gorgeous. Do you have a photo of Bai Yue?”\n\n“Of course.” Xiao Wei opened the webpage on his tablet and handed it over.\n\nGu Jun looked at the screen.\n\nThere it was, the official “Top Ten Flowers of Tianhai Royal University” list. Right at the top were two profiles: Bai Yue and Xia Qingyue, side by side. Below their names were professionally taken photos, radiant with youth and poise.\n\nGu Jun’s eyes lingered briefly on Bai Yue’s picture. She wore a formal outfit, minimal makeup, and a serene expression, but even so, her elegance was unmistakable.\n\nHe scanned the rest of the list.\n\nHe didn’t recognize number 2 or 3.\n\nNumber 4 was Bai Xue.\n\nThen a few more unfamiliar names... until number 7: Rong Xi.\n\nAnd finally, in ninth place: Tang Mei.\n\nZhao Ming gawked. “All of them are insanely beautiful. I seriously need to start picking my target.”\n\nXiao Wei gave him a side glance. “Pick all you want, but don’t expect any of them to be easy.”\n\nZhou Hao chuckled. “You’ll need more than good looks and charm to impress any of them.”\n\n“Yeah,” Xiao Wei added, “these aren’t ordinary girls. Every single one comes with... baggage, political, academic, social. You mess up, and it’s game over.”\n\nZhao Ming laughed it off, but even he looked a bit more thoughtful afterward.\n\nDormitory No. 3 had just gotten its first real taste of campus gossip.",

            "content": "Gu Jun and his roommates were still seated at the restaurant.\nGu Jun sat quietly, lost in thought. Li Ming, ever the silent type, remained still beside him, while Zhao Ming, Zhou Hao, and Xiao Wei were still chattering, voices animated with gossip and laughter.\n\nGu Jun’s mind, however, drifted elsewhere.\nHe was thinking about Bai Yue.\n\nShe was undeniably stunning, elegant, and poised with an extraordinary family background. But even with all that, to rise as the number one flower at Tianhai Royal University, and also become the student council president? That wasn’t something looks or connections alone could achieve. Not at a school where excellence was the bare minimum.\n\nThere had to be more.\nSecrets. Power. Influence.\nAnd what about Xia Qingyue? Her soft image might just be a veil over something more complex, more dangerous.\n\nStill, Gu Jun didn’t care. Not yet.\n\nAt that moment, the door opened, and four girls stepped into the restaurant.\nGu Jun’s eyes instinctively went to the entrance as he was seated facing the door.\n\nAmong them, he immediately recognized Rong Xi and Bai Xue. The other two were unfamiliar, but their presence turned heads throughout the room. Conversations paused, and spoons hovered mid-air.\nThey were all beautiful, but Bai Xue and Rong Xi stood out like stars in a cloudy sky.\n\nGu Jun’s eyes briefly met Bai Xue’s.\nHer expression was terrible. She looked furious.\n\nRong Xi, walking beside her, glanced at her friend with a mix of amusement and sympathy.\n\nBai Xue was still simmering with embarrassment.\nJust thinking about it made her stomach turn. A boy, some random boy, had completely humiliated her. He’d played her like a flute, tricking her into believing he was her sister’s secret boyfriend.\nAnd then… that moment.\nWhen she had confidently declared in front of Bai Yue and Rong Xi that she’d just had dinner with her sister’s boyfriend.\n\nThe looks on their faces.\nShe wanted to dig a hole and disappear.\n\nIf she ever saw that boy again, she’d strangle him.\n\nRong Xi could tell exactly what was going on in her head. She grinned and teased, “Don’t worry, he’s also a student at our university. You’ll see your dear brother-in-law again very soon.”\n\nBai Xue gave her a sharp glare and snorted, clearly not amused.\n\nAs they were heading toward the private section of the restaurant, Rong Xi suddenly stopped.\nShe looked toward a table by the window… and burst out laughing.\n\n“Speak of the devil,” she said, nudging Bai Xue. “There he is, your brother-in-law.”\n\nBai Xue instinctively turned her head.\nAnd there he was.\n\nGu Jun.\n\nSitting casually with a group of boys, chopsticks in hand, completely unfazed.\nHer face turned crimson, not with embarrassment this time, but with pure rage.\n\nWithout a second thought, she stormed across the restaurant, practically marching toward him.\n\nEnsure your favorite authors get the support they deserve. Read this novel on the original website.\n\nAt the table, Gu Jun had already noticed her.\nBut instead of reacting, he calmly brought a spoonful of rice to his mouth, chewing slowly.\n\nThe sound of hurried footsteps grew louder.\n\nEveryone turned to look. Zhao Ming’s eyes widened as he laid eyes on Bai Xue, he was visibly stunned by her beauty.\n\nGu Jun glanced up just as Bai Xue arrived, glaring at him as if she might throw the entire table over.\n\nHe swallowed his food, set down his spoon, and said in a calm, casual tone, “Oh, hello, sister-in-law. You're here? Come, sit down. Eat with us, it’s my treat.”\n\nJust then, Rong Xi arrived behind her and, upon hearing Gu Jun’s words, let out an uncontrollable laugh. Bai Xue stormed over and glared at Gu Jun.\n\n“To hell with your eating!” she snapped. “Why did you trick me? Why did you make me look like a fool in front of my sister?”\n\nGu Jun didn’t even flinch. He calmly chewed his food, then gestured with his chopsticks.\n\n“Lower your voice,” he said, almost lazily. “Everyone’s staring.”\n\nSure enough, Bai Xue glanced around and saw not only their tablemates but also nearby diners watching with curious eyes.\n\nStill fuming, she turned back to Gu Jun.\n“I don’t care!” she hissed. “You humiliated me. How are you going to make it up to me?”\n\nGu Jun wiped his mouth with a napkin, looked her straight in the eyes, and said flatly,\n“Simple. I’ll make you my real sister-in-law. Problem solved.”\n\n“You!”\n\n“Sit down,” he said sharply, voice suddenly edged with authority.\n\nBai Xue stared at him for a long second, her breath catching in her throat. Then, with a defeated huff, she sat down, clearly still bristling with anger.\n\nThere were enough seats, so Rong Xi and the other girls took their places as well.\n\nXiao Wei blinked.\n“Sister-in-law?” he repeated, eyes flicking between Bai Xue and Gu Jun. “What’s all of this about?”\n\nBai Xue ignored him. Rong Xi rolled her eyes.\n\n“Shut up, you white-faced peacock.”\n\nXiao Wei simply smiled and stroked his face with both hands, clearly taking the insult as a compliment.\n“You say that like it’s a bad thing.”\n\nThen Rong Xi turned her gaze to Gu Jun.\n“Well, well, junior brother,” she said with a teasing smile. “I heard you’ve been having a good time lately. You’ve barely set foot in Tianhai, and already girls are flocking to you. Impressive.”\n\nGu Jun didn’t respond to her. He simply glanced at Bai Xue and said,\n“Alright, don’t be upset. I was just joking about being your sister’s boyfriend. But if it bothers you that much, I’ll just go ahead and become her real boyfriend. Even though she’s not all that great, I’ll reluctantly accept her.”\n\nPfft..\nXiao Wei had just taken a sip of red wine when Gu Jun finished speaking. The moment the words registered, he spat them out in a sudden burst, accidentally soaking Zhao Ming across the table.\n\nZhao Ming cursed, while Xiao Wei coughed and wiped his mouth, staring at Gu Jun as if he were a ghost.\n\nHe knew exactly who Bai Yue’s sister was.\n\nEveryone in Tianhai’s elite circles knew Bai Yue, the cold queen, the perfect student, the pride of the Bai family. But most didn’t know her true background. Xiao Wei did.\n\nYes, her father was from the Bai family. But her maternal side... that was the real storm.\n\nHer maternal grandfather was one of the Nine Chiefs of the central government.\nAnd her mother...\n\nXiao Wei’s thoughts stopped there. He physically shuddered.\n\nJust thinking about that woman made his blood run cold.\n\nHe turned to Gu Jun again, eyes wide.\nA mix of astonishment, awe, and a flicker of pity.\n\n“Bro,” he muttered under his breath. “You really don’t value your life, do you?”\n\nIn Tianhai’s inner circle, no one dared joke like that about Bai Yue. Not because of her, but because of the titanic force behind her. One wrong word, one wrong move...\nAnd you’d disappear.\n\nGu Jun, of course, just went back to his food like nothing happened.",

            "content": "Rong Xi stared at Gu Jun, utterly dumbfounded.\n\nIf a girl had joked like that, it would have been harmless banter. But when a boy like Gu Jun says something so bold, especially about someone like Bai Yue, it was bound to stir trouble. Not just from the Bai family, but from Bai Yue’s long line of admirers.\n\nSensing the shift in atmosphere, Rong Xi quickly tried to change the subject.\n\n“Hey, junior brother, why are you ignoring me?” she said, putting on an exaggerated pout. “Thanks to you, I’m in deep trouble now. The Wang family is demanding an apology and blaming me for everything. I stood up for you, and this is how you repay me?”\n\nXiao Wei glanced at Gu Jun with renewed admiration. The kind of trouble Gu Jun stirred just by existing was both enviable and dangerous.\n\nRong Xi continued, “Let me introduce my two friends. This is Ji Yan, and this is Qiang Suyan. They’re both third-years.”\n\nGu Jun gave them a polite nod.\n\nThe boys took their turn introducing themselves.\n\nWhen it was Xiao Wei’s turn, Rong Xi rolled her eyes and snapped, “You don’t need to say anything, white-faced peacock. I know you too well. But remember, you’re in Tianhai Royal University now. My turf. Stop flashing that face around and seducing girls everywhere.”\n\nXiao Wei replied, ever the charmer, “I don’t seduce anyone. They see my face and get seduced all on their own.”\n\nThis time, Bai Xue chimed in coldly, “Then maybe cover your face before going out in public.”\n\nXiao Wei clutched his chest and looked dramatically at Bai Xue. “Sister, you wound me.”\n\nMeanwhile, Zhao Ming was quietly observing Ji Yan and Qiang Suyan, clearly trying to figure out how to strike up a conversation. Unfortunately, neither of them even glanced at him. Their eyes were focused on Zhou Hao, Xiao Wei, and, surprisingly, even Li Ming.\n\nZhou Hao had a calm, noble air. Xiao Wei had charm and flamboyance. And Li Ming, though silent and distant, carried an air of mystery that some girls found irresistible.\n\nPoor Zhao Ming could only sigh in defeat and sip his drink.\n\nA moment later, the waiter arrived with a new bottle of wine. Everyone raised their glasses and took a sip.\n\nGu Jun then turned toward Rong Xi. “So, what’s going on with the Wang family?”\n\nRong Xi's face immediately turned sour. “Ugh, they’re being dramatic. I just broke a little bone in his hand, so what’s the big deal? I’m such a beautiful girl, can’t they let something like that slide?”\n\nShe sighed and continued, “My dad scolded me for hours. If it wasn’t for my grandfather stepping in, I think he would’ve beaten me. Honestly, if I were going to get punished anyway, I should’ve just broken his legs while I was at it!”\n\nThe table went quiet for a beat.\n\nThen Xiao Wei muttered under his breath, “Remind me never to get on her bad side.”\n\nUnauthorized content usage: if you discover this narrative on Amazon, report the violation.\n\nAntarctica.\nA frozen world. Heaven made of ice, or hell, depending on who you ask.\n\nIt was midnight. A brutal ice storm raged across the barren continent, winds howling like tortured spirits. Visibility was almost zero, but suddenly, three silhouettes appeared in the white chaos.\n\nAll three were men, seemingly in their thirties. One stood at the front, while the other two followed closely behind.\n\nAnyone who saw them would be stunned; this world-ending storm didn’t seem to touch them. The winds bent around their bodies, and the snow didn’t cling to their robes. They walked as if through a spring breeze.\n\nIn the hand of the leading figure was a golden rod. At first glance, it seemed like nothing more than an ornate staff, but every four seconds, it pulsed with a faint golden glow, accompanied by a soft clicking sound.\n\nIt was no ordinary tool; it was a Treasure-Seeking Staff, specifically tuned to locate pieces of the Heaven-Encompassing Array.\n\nThe man wielding it was Longyun, the Tenth Elder of the Gu Empire and one of the deputy Executors of the Tianhai Plan. A peak Initial Innate expert. The two men behind him were his subordinates, Code B and Code Z, both in the late stage of Huajin.\n\nThey were here for one purpose: to locate the final piece of the Heaven-Encompassing Array, a mystical formation being assembled in secret in Tianhai.\n\nThey moved through the icy wasteland at frightening speed, unaffected by the sub-zero temperatures or the storm’s fury.\n\nThen, the rod changed. The glow and clicking were no longer periodic; they came in rapid succession.\n\nThe three men exchanged glances.\n\nThey were close.\n\nAfter three relentless hours, they reached a massive, ice-covered mound, a frozen hill that rose like a tombstone in the lifeless land. The staff pulsed wildly now, reacting nonstop.\n\nThis was the place.\n\nThe men halted. Longyun raised another artifact from his storage ring, a small metallic disc etched with ancient runes. He placed it on the ground.\n\nFrom the device, invisible waves rippled outward in all directions, passing through ice and earth before bouncing back. Longyun closed his eyes, attuning his senses to the returning echoes.\n\nThirty minutes passed. His eyes opened.\n\nFound it.\n\n“It’s on the left flank of the mound, about 600 meters deep,” he said. “Ice, followed by rocky earth, and then water. Inside the water are floating rocks, one of which contains the fragment.”\n\nWithout hesitation, they moved.\n\nWithin ten minutes, they bored through the thick ice sheet and rocky ground, reaching the underwater cavity. The water was strangely still, eerily quiet.\n\nLongyun and Code B descended into it, leaving Code Z above.\n\nThere, in the dark water, suspended among slowly drifting boulders, was the object.\n\nLongyun stared at it for nearly ten minutes. His senses probed every inch, looking for traps, curses, or concealed arrays. Nothing.\n\nAt last, he extended his hand.\n\nJust as his fingers brushed the fragment..\n\nA chill unlike anything he’d ever felt crawled up his spine.\n\nEven submerged, the hair on his body stood on end.\n\nBehind him, something stirred. Something ancient. Something malevolent.\n\nHe didn’t turn, but he could feel it, the presence.\n\nElsewhere.\nIn an unknown corner of the world, a place where no light reached, only endless blackness..\n\nA pair of deep, cold eyes opened.\n\nIt was Xuanzhi. He stared silently, across space and distance, toward Antarctica.\n\nIn other places around the globe, other eyes, strange, profound, terrifying, also opened.\n\nAll of them turned their gaze toward the frozen continent.\n\nSomething had been disturbed.",

            "content": "Longyun was an innate-level powerhouse; his very presence crushed lesser beings. Fear? He had long grown beyond it.\n\nBut now…\nHe was afraid.\n\nNo, worse than being afraid.\nSomething vile twisted inside him: a crawling, suffocating feeling tangled with a deep, irrational hatred, as if his very soul rejected what stood behind him. He didn’t understand it. The feeling was raw and ancient, like his body remembered something his mind could not.\n\nHis heartbeat slowed into silence, blood pounding like war drums in his ears.\nHe turned slowly and Dreadfully.\n\nAnd there it was.\n\nIt was a creature, or something that had once tried to be one.\nBird-like only in silhouette, like a rotting parody of flight.\n\nNearly thirty meters long, its wings were torn membranes stitched with bone and sinew. Its translucent skin clung to twitching veins that pulsed with thick, black blood. Every breath it took felt wrong, like the world itself rejected its existence.\n\nIts face was the worst:\nA jagged mockery of a beak fused with a human jaw, lined with needle-like teeth slick with mucus.\nIts milky eyes twitched, bulging from deep sockets, searching for something to hate.\n\nLongyun froze. Its gaze felt greasy, invasive, crawling under his skin.\n\nThen it opened its mouth, slowly and horribly.\nThe jaw cracked wide, revealing not a tongue but a nest of slick, barbed tendrils, twitching hungrily, scraping wetly.\n\nThough underwater, the stench hit him, a wave of decay and rot so foul he nearly gagged. His qi stirred, not to attack, but to protect him from the corruption radiating off this thing.\n\nIt tilted its head, not like a predator.\n\nBut something curious… about what screaming felt like.\n\nEverything went still.\nThe water around them shimmered with eerie calm, too calm. Time seemed to freeze.\n\nThen..\n\nIt roared.\n\nThe sound shattered the silence like a tidal wave of hate. It wasn't just noise, it was pressure, a thunderous blast that sent ripples through the water and pain through Longyun’s bones.\n\nLongyun's heart pounded. He didn’t need to scan its qi to know, this thing was stronger. Far stronger. At least the late stage of Innate Realm, perhaps beyond. Far beyond his current strength.\n\nBut strength wasn’t everything.\n\nHe clenched his fists. Its movements… sluggish. Its eyes… unfocused. Could it be lacking intelligence? Instinct-driven?\n\nThat was his only chance.\n\nThen it lunged.\n\nA blur of motion, Longyun barely evaded, spinning through the water, the beast’s grotesque appendage slicing through where he had stood just moments before.\n\nHis hand flashed. A gleam of steel. The sword light flashed.\nIt is not just any blade; it is an innate-grade weapon, humming with energy, qi coiling around it like a living flame.\n\nHe struck mid-motion, his body twisting, sword swinging in a precise arc.\nA crescent-shaped beam of cutting light shot forth, slicing toward the creature’s side.\n\nAnother beam flashed in from the opposite angle, his subordinate, Code B.\nA perfectly timed dual assault, from both flanks.\n\nThe beams struck.\n\nThe water exploded in light and vapor, a blinding detonation of energy.\n\nWhen the underwater mist cleared...\n\nDid you know this text is from a different site? Read the official version to support the creator.\n\nNothing.\nThe creature had barely flinched. Its skin writhed and healed around scorched tissue, its blood was dark and thick, but the damage was superficial.\n\nNow, it hovered between them.\nLongyun on one side, Code B on the other, they flank it like wolves circling a titan.\n\nWithout a word, they moved, running circular paths, weaving through the water in synchronized arcs, building momentum. The speed and pattern generated a swirling current, forming a vacuum-like pull meant to distort its balance.\n\nWith each rotation, they struck again. Blades flashing, beams crisscrossing, seeking weak spots, probing for reaction.\n\nBut Longyun felt the trap they were in. The moment it roared, he sensed it; this place wasn’t natural. It was a field, an underwater array that was trapping them.\nNo reinforcements.\nNo escape.\nThe only way out: kill the monster.\n\nSuddenly, the beast froze. Its wings quivered. Limbs twitching. It looked disoriented. Immobile.\n\nBut Longyun didn’t relax.\nHe felt it; something was wrong.\n\nThen it moved.\n\nNot toward him but toward Code B.\n\nWith terrifying speed, it snapped its massive wing-limb, the motion slicing through the water like a whip of raw flesh and bone.\n\nCode B reacted fast, his sword raised, handguard flaring with defensive light.\nTwo barriers ignited, spiritual force crackling.\n\nIt was too slow and too weak.\n\nThe wing struck.\n\nThere was a crunch, a terrible, wet noise, and Code B’s body was hurled sideways like a broken doll.\nHis leg was gone, shredded below the thigh.\n\nLongyun had a super-powerful divine sense due to his innate level cultivation, so seeing through air or water in the dark was the same for him. But code B is different. His divine sense is a lot weaker than his, so he was a little slow.\n\nBlood exploded outward, a red cloud spreading violently in the water.\nA Huajin cultivator’s body could circulate vast amounts of qi and blood, so now it is fueling the ocean with crimson trails.\n\nThe beast twitched in delight.\n\nIt breathed it in. Excited.\nIts grotesque jaw creaked open, revealing the tendril-lined throat. It was preparing for the kill with its mouth.\n\nLongyun didn’t hesitate.\n\nHe flashed forward, blade trailing arcs of qi behind him.\nBefore the jaws could close, he struck, aiming for the neck.\n\nThe creature dodged with unexpected speed, but that was enough.\nLongyun was beside Code B in a flash, grabbing his wounded ally by the shoulder.\n\nThen..\n\nAnother attack.\n\nIt came fast.\nLongyun turned, blade raised in reflex.\n\nAt the same time, Code B struck too, unleashing his strength in a burst of raw spiritual energy.\n\nTwo strikes. One moment.\n\nThey hit together, forcing the beast back, its bloated body rippling under the impact.\n\nIt shrieked, retreating Several meters, rage boiling in its corrupted veins.\n\nBut Longyun wasn’t celebrating.\nThey were still outmatched.\n\nLongyun could still feel it, the residue of fear clinging to his limbs, making his movements just a fraction too slow, a fraction too hesitant.\n\nIt infuriated him.\n\nFear.\nA humiliating emotion. An insult to his pride.\n\nEven in the face of death, he had no right to feel fear.\nHe was an elder of the Gu Empire. A cultivator of innate strength. Why should he fear anything?\n\nSuddenly, he felt something. He closed his eyes.\n\nDarkness.\n\nSilence.\n\nHe stood in that place for a few still seconds.\n\nThen, he opened his eyes.\n\nThe fear was gone.\n\nIn its place bloomed something sharper: cold arrogance, piercing clarity. And beneath it all, a chilling indifference.\n\nLongyun felt a new sensation stir within him, one that left him slightly stunned. If the earlier emotion had been fear, this was its mirror image: a surge of innate pride, a defiant arrogance awakening from deep inside, pushing back against the pressure of the beast’s presence.\n\nHe instinctively knew this wasn’t normal. Neither emotion was. They were too primal, too precise. They weren’t entirely his.\n\nWere they coming from his brain? His heart? His instincts? Or were they buried deeper, etched into his blood, his soul, his DNA?\n\nLongyun slowly raised his gaze and locked eyes with the creature for the first time.\n\nNo more evasion. No more hesitation.\n\nAnd the beast… stared back.\n\nIts sluggishness ebbed away. Muscles twitched beneath its grotesque hide as awareness sharpened in its gaze.\n\nIt was waking up. And soon, it would begin to wield the full force of its innate level of power.\n\nThis battle would be dangerous.\nBut now, so was he.",

            "content": "Longyun’s mind was now completely clear.\nHis eyes locked onto the beast, scanning its grotesque body, searching for a weakness.\n\nIts skin was almost transparent, a stretched, glistening film.\nAnd then, he saw it.\n\nNear its stomach, a dark, round organ, pulsing slowly, inflating and shrinking like a grotesque heart.\n\nLongyun’s instincts surged.\nThat’s it.\nThat must be the core. It is its weakness. If we destroy it, we can kill it.\n\nBut knowing was one thing.\nDoing was another.\n\nDespite its transparent skin, the beast’s flesh was absurdly durable, comparable to an innate-grade treasure. Longyun had already felt that firsthand.\n\nHe reached into his space ring and pulled out a handful of healing pills. Swallowing one himself, he handed two more to Code B.\n\nBoth cultivators were injured, but now, their eyes burned with renewed focus.\n\nRound two was about to begin.\n\nTianhai\n\nBack in Tianhai, the night had only just begun.\n\nGu Jun and the others stepped out of the restaurant, laughing and talking, not yet ready to head back to their dorms.\n\nThey decided to visit a nearby nightclub to relax.\n\nTruthfully, Gu Jun wasn’t too interested; he had already drunk a little wine, and nightclubs weren’t his scene.\nBut resisting Rong Xi’s relentless persuasion proved impossible.\n\nThere were eight of them, and they split between two sleek black cars, just enough to carry the group.\n\nThis nightclub was called Readrose, one of Tianhai’s most popular.\nThe moment they entered, it was like stepping into another world, flashing lights, pounding music, and the scent of perfume and alcohol.\n\nMen were drinking.\nWomen were dancing.\nLaughter echoed from every direction.\n\nGu Jun noticed several middle-aged men watching the crowd, especially girls, with greedy, rat-like eyes, scanning for opportunities.\n\nTheir group was escorted to a glass-covered private room, soundproof and elevated, giving them a full view of the club below.\nDrinks were ordered, some alcoholic, some mocktails. Gu Jun just chose a simple orange juice.\n\nThen..\n\n“Let’s go dance,” Rong Xi said, nudging Gu Jun.\n\nGu Jun gave a half-smile.\n“Coming here is already a compromise. Don’t expect more.”\n\n“Boring,” she muttered, rolling her eyes.\nThen she turned to Zhao Ming.\n“You come with me to dance.”\n\nZhao Ming looked stunned, unsure whether it was a joke.\n\nSupport the creativity of authors by visiting the original site for this novel and more.\n\nRong Xi added dryly, “Don’t look at me like that. Your job tonight is to be my flower protector.”\n\nSo Rong Xi, Zhao Ming, and two girls headed toward the dance floor.\nBai Xue, meanwhile, stayed behind, her role now reduced to silently glaring at Gu Jun, as if his calmness offended her.\n\nGu Jun simply sipped his drink and watched them dance, detached and thoughtful.\n\nEventually, the high-energy music faded.\nThe lights dimmed. A brief hush fell over the club.\n\nThen a girl stepped onto the stage with a microphone.\n\nGu Jun looked up. Her beauty somewhat made him pause.\n\n“Isn’t she beautiful?” said Xiao Wei, seated beside him.\n\nGu Jun nodded slowly.\n\n“She’s from the Art Department, called Luo Yuxin,” Xiao Wei continued. “Not one of the top ten beauties officially, but that’s just politics. No backing. No connections. Still, she’s insanely popular. Half the guys in the university are chasing her.”\n\nHe paused, smirking.\n\n“She’s… accessible. Her dad’s just a minor official in Jin Province. That’s all.”\n\nGu Jun said nothing.\nGu Jun was no longer watching Luo Yuxin on stage.\nNow, his gaze shifted to Zhao Ming, who sat quietly at the side of the dance floor. The three girls had gone to the restroom, leaving Zhao Ming alone, but his eyes never left the stage.\n\nThere was no mistaking it.\nHe knew her.\n\nHis expression was intense, focused, not the look of a man enjoying a performance, but someone watching someone he once held close.\nSeveral times, it seemed like he wanted to approach her. But each time, he hesitated.\nShe was singing, and he didn’t want to interrupt.\n\nEventually, the song ended.\n\nZhao Ming stood up, finally gathering the courage to approach her.\n\nBut someone else was faster.\n\nA young man stepped out from a VIP booth near the stage, strode forward, and grabbed Luo Yuxin’s wrist forcefully, trying to drag her back toward the private cabin.\nShe resisted, clearly unwilling, twisting her arm to break free.\n\nZhao Ming immediately stepped in.\n\n“Let her go!” he shouted, his eyes burning.\n\nBut before he could do anything more, a slap came from the side.\nOne of the young man’s companions struck him hard.\n\n\"idiot.\"\n\nZhao Ming’s body lifted off the ground and crashed onto a table, dishes and glasses shattering beneath him.\n\nThe atmosphere changed.\nZhou Hao’s and Xiao Wei’s expressions shifted instantly, especially Xiao Wei’s, whose face now twisted in cold, genuine anger.\n\nGu Jun sipped his drink calmly, eyes flicking between the scene and his companions.\nThese two pampered \"young masters\" might act frivolously sometimes, but they clearly weren’t used to seeing their own people humiliated.\nZhao Ming may be new, but he’s their roommate, Gu Jun thought.\nAnd now, he’s in their circle, whether he realizes it or not.\n\nThe tension was about to explode.\n\nXiao Wei stood up and strode out of the booth. His voice was sharp:\n\n“Xiao Hao, what the hell do you think you’re doing?”\n\nThe young man, Xiao Hao, didn’t even turn. Still gripping the girl’s wrist, he sneered:\n\n“None of your business.”\n\n“It is my business. That guy you just hit? He’s my friend.”\n\nXiao Hao laughed dismissively.\n\n“So what?”\n\nZhao Ming struggled to his feet, blood at the corner of his mouth.\n\n“Let her go,” he said again, louder this time.\n\nNow, another voice responded, one of Xiao Hao’s companions who had just slapped Zhao Ming:\n\n“Why? She agreed to accompany Brother Xiao Hao tonight. Who the hell are you to interfere?”\n\nLuo Yuxin finally spoke, voice trembling with anger:\n\n“Liar! When did I agree to that? Let me go, or I am calling the police.”\n\nWang Hai’s smirk widened.\n\n“You said you’d sing tonight in exchange for a great opportunity.”\n\n“You said you’d introduce me to someone from an entertainment company!”\n\n“Yeah,” he replied coldly, “your opportunity is to accompany Brother Xiao Hao. Get it now?”\n\n“You bastard!”\n\n“Tch... not many people dare to curse me, Wang Hai, and the police? No police dare to come here easily. And even if they come later, at that time you will be…” Wang Hai gave a creepy smile.\n\nGu Jun watched the man with faint amusement.\n\nMid-stage Bright Strength realm, he assessed casually.\nFrom his aura, and that name... he’s probably from the Wang Family.\n\nAnd then he remembered something else.\n\nThis nightclub... It's under the Green Gang.\n\nGu Jun’s eyes narrowed slightly.\nThe left side of Tianhai Royal University, including this area, belongs to them.\nThe right side is under the control of the Imperial Bull Gang.\n\nIt was a somewhat interesting setup.",

            "content": "Gu Jun casually took out his phone and sent a message.\nSince I’m already here enjoying time and board... might as well have some fun.\n\nThen he turned to Bai Xue and asked with a smirk,\n\n“Sister-in-law, do you know who that Xiao guy is?”\n\nBai Xue snapped, irritation flashing in her eyes.\n\n“Who are you calling sister-in-law? I’ve told you before, don’t call me that. And I’m warning you for your good. If the wrong person hears you calling me that so casually, you’ll bring trouble on yourself. This isn’t a joke. You’re not my sister’s boyfriend, and people here take these things seriously.”\n\nGu Jun raised his hands in mock surrender.\n\n“Alright, alright, I get it. I’ll be careful. Now, tell me, who’s that Xiao Hao guy?”\n\nBai Xue gave him a measured look before replying.\n\n“He’s the youngest son of the eldest son of the Xiao family head.”\n\nShe paused, then added with a bit more weight in her voice:\n\n“You probably don’t know this, but the Xiao family is the most powerful family in Tianhai.”\n\nThere was a flicker of concern, or perhaps warning, in her eyes.\n\n“And that Xiao Hao… he’s Xiao Wei’s cousin. They have a bad relationship.”\n\nShe gave Gu Jun a long, thoughtful look, her tone shifting slightly.\n\n“Honestly, I’m a little surprised by your attitude. Zhao Ming is your roommate, your friend. Look at Xiao Wei and Zhou Hao, they jumped in without hesitation. But you and your other roommate? You’re just watching. I can’t tell if you’re wise… or just selfish.”\n\nGu Jun didn’t react to her judgmental tone.\nHe simply turned his attention back to the unfolding scene on the dance floor.\n\nMoments later, a divine sense message brushed across his mind from Li Ming.\n\n“Your Highness, Xiao Hao’s father is the leader of the faction that wants to split from the Gu Empire.”\n\nGu Jun’s expression remained unreadable.\n\nLi Ming wasn’t just his bodyguard; he was also his eyes and ears, trained to memorize and monitor everything Gu Jun might need to know.\n\n“Hmm.”\nHe responded softly.\n\nOn the stage, the tension continued to rise.\n\nXiao Wei stepped forward, facing down Xiao Hao and Wang Hai.\n\n“Let them go. This ends now.”\n\nXiao Hao’s expression twisted into a sneer.\n\n“Little Cousin, you disappoint me. You’d stand against me? All for some random girl and a nobody roommate? I was just having a bit of fun.”\n\nXiao Wei’s voice was calm but firm.\n\n“First of all, I’m not as little as you think. Second… I heard you’ve been chasing Luo Yuxin for months. And now, just because she rejected you, you want to force her? That’s low, even for you. It will hurt your already bad reputation.”\n\nHe took a step forward.\n\n“Don’t forget, you’re a member of the Xiao family. Act like it.”\n\nXiao Wei narrowed his eyes and added,\n\nSupport creative writers by reading their stories on Royal Road, not stolen versions.\n\n“If you don’t correct yourself soon, the Discipline Elder might personally ‘educate’ you. In fact, if you don’t let them go right now, I’ll call him myself. And we both know that won’t end well for you.”\n\nHe then turned his gaze to Wang Hai, tone calm but cutting.\n\n“Sure, this might be your turf, and maybe Xiao Hao can shield you for now. But do you think he can protect you for the rest of your life? Be smart. Let them go. Show a little heart, and I’ll take that as a concession. Do your part.”\n\nA flicker of hesitation passed through Wang Hai’s eyes. He knew exactly how much trouble Xiao Hao could bring him… but he also understood Xiao Wei wasn’t someone to provoke lightly. He glanced at Xiao Hao, uncertain.\n\nThat single glance was enough to bruise Xiao Hao’s pride. His face twisted with contempt as he looked at Xiao Wei, then at Zhao Ming and Luo Yuxin, his eyes cold and snake-like.\n\n“Afraid of your threats? Do you forget who my father is? He’s the strongest candidate to be the next head of the Xiao family. Sure, the Discipline Elder might punish me, I won’t deny that. But in the end, they’ll let me go. And while you wait for him to get here…”\n“I’ll have plenty of time to do things you’ll regret.”\n\nXiao Wei’s expression darkened, but he didn’t respond.\n\nXiao Hao sneered.\n\n“Here’s what’s going to happen. You can take your friend. He got slapped for stepping in. I’ll let that go. As for the girl, she’s coming with me.”\n“She’s not your girlfriend, is she? Just an acquaintance. So I'll generously repay her after having some fun, and that will give you face.”\n\nHe paused, then added with a chuckle:\n\n“We’re both called useless in the Xiao family, me, a waste; you, a disappointment. Us two ‘failures’ shouldn’t fight each other, right?”\n\nThe room fell into silence.\nAll eyes were on Xiao Wei.\n\nNo one was dancing anymore. No one was laughing.\nThe entire club had gone still, caught in the gravity of the confrontation.\nSome wanted to leave long ago, but fear of backlash, or worse, being labeled a witness, kept them rooted in place.\n\nDesperation clouded the eyes of both Zhao Ming and Luo Yuxin.\nThey understood now, this wasn’t just a petty confrontation. They were truly cornered, and getting out of this intact seemed nearly impossible.\n\nTheir eyes met. Silent. Fragile.\nA shimmer of moisture glistened at the corner of Luo Yuxin’s eyes, threatening to fall.\n\nSeeing her tears, Zhao Ming pushed himself up again, swaying slightly as pain shot through his body. He reached out, trying to get to her—\n\nSmack!\nAnother slap cracked across his face, sharper than the first. Blood from the corner of his lips darkened, trailing down his chin.\n\nThe girl gasped and tried to break free, rushing toward Zhao Ming—\n\nSmack!\nThis time, the slap came from Xiao Hao himself. The sound echoed louder than the music ever had.\n\nShe stumbled back, clutching her cheek, tears falling freely now.\n\nXiao Hao clicked his tongue and turned toward Xiao Wei, wearing a cruel grin.\n\n“Well then, cousin… looks like the ball’s in your court now.”\n\nThis is now an issue of his face and influence, not a simple romantic play.\n\nIn the middle of this standoff, Gu Jun sat quietly just outside of his cabin, sipping his drink.\nHis eyes shifted from Xiao Wei to Xiao Hao.\n\nAs expected of the Xiao family… Neither of them is easy to deal with.\n\nThen..\n\nToc. Toc. Toc.\nThe sound of high heels on the hardwood floor broke the tension.\n\nRong Xi emerged from the restroom, flanked by two friends.\nA moment later, Bai Xue stepped out of Gu Jun’s cabin.\n\nShe looked at Xiao Hao, calm but firm.\n\n“Actually, Xiao Hao… you’re mistaken if you think we’re weak. Muscle power? We’re not as helpless as you think. So let’s end this here. Time to go home.”\n\nA new silence fell over the nightclub.\n\nThe tension was no longer just between Xiao Hao and Xiao Wei; it had spread like a fog, thick and suffocating. Everyone present felt it.\n\nXiao Hao’s gaze shifted, lingering bitterly on Rong Xi and Bai Xue. His pride had taken too many blows tonight, and the sight of those girls, calm, defiant, only added fuel to the fire.\n\nHis eyes then flicked toward the VIP cabin, a glint of hope flickering in his expression.\n\nAnd right on cue, the door opened.\n\nA man stepped out.\n\nHe looked around twenty-five, dressed in a semi-formal outfit with effortless confidence. His polished shoes caught the light, and his posture radiated ease, but not warmth.\n\nThe room’s atmosphere shifted immediately.\n\nXiao Hao’s face lit up with smug relief.\n\n“Ah, I was wondering who that was…”\n“Turns out it’s our little Rong and little Bai. How are you two?”\n\nHis tone was friendly, too friendly.\nIt had the sharp edge of someone pretending to be polite while holding a knife behind their back.\n\nRong Xi’s expression didn’t change. Bai Xue narrowed her eyes slightly.",

            "content": "Gu Jun swirled his drink lazily, then turned to Li Ming.\n“Who’s that?”\n\nLi Ming glanced at the newcomer, hesitated a moment, then replied,\n“Your Highness, he’s somewhat related to you, through your mother’s side. His name is Ning Zhe, the son of your mother’s cousin. He belongs to the Ning family from the capital.”\n\nHe paused before continuing,\n“The Ning clan ranks last among the Ten Great Noble Families. But Ning Zhe is the eldest grandson of the family head, and a strong candidate to become the next successor, especially with his budding ties to the Zi family.”\n\nLi Ming lowered his voice slightly,\n“Your mother doesn’t have a favorable view of the Ning family. In the empire’s long-term capital strategy, they’ve been assigned a role… and it’s not a good one. The Planning Council also suspects they may have had a distant connection to the assassination attempt on you when you were twelve. Your mother also may know this and is still investigating quietly.”\n\nHe added,\n“Ning Zhe is currently the vice president of the Tianhai branch of Ning Corporation.”\n\nGu Jun chuckled softly.\n“Should I go down, make a grand entry, and give him a dramatic surprise? Something like, ‘Hello, cousin. Fancy seeing you here.”\n\nLi Ming looked slightly embarrassed.\n“I wouldn’t presume to say, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun shook his head.\n“No, I won’t. You know how I feel about my maternal side. Besides, this scene will be far more interesting without my interference, for now. Some of the actors haven’t taken the stage yet.”\n\nHis gaze drifted to Zhou Hao, who was calmly observing the growing tension below.\n\nAfter a moment, Gu Jun said,\n“Li Ming, don’t stay so stiff around me. We’ll be together for a long time. No need for heavy formal distance.”\n\nLi Ming exhaled through his nose, clearly exasperated but respectful.\n“Understood, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun smiled faintly, then turned his full attention to the situation unfolding.\n\nOn the floor below...\n\nBai Xue crossed her arms and glared at Ning Zhe.\n“I was wondering who gave Xiao Hao the guts to act this shamelessly. So it’s you, smelly Ning Zhe. Birds of a feather do flock together.”\n\nRong Xi added with a sneer,\n“Or maybe cattle from the same muddy pen.”\n\nNing Zhe’s smile was cold and unbothered.\n“Watch your mouths, little girls. There aren’t many in this country who would dare speak to me like that.”\n\nThen, it happened. So suddenly, no one had time to react.\n\nA blur of motion, a vicious, lightning-fast kick smashed directly into Ning Zhe’s chest. His body arced through the air with a brutal grace, crashing down several meters away with a heavy thud.\n\nTime seemed to freeze.\n\nAll breath stopped. The room fell into a stunned, suffocating silence.\n\nEvery eye turned.\n\nIt was Zhou Hao.\nHe stood there, calm but seething, eyes fixed on Ning Zhe with unmasked disdain and cold hatred.\n\nNing Zhe groaned and struggled to rise. Despite having cultivation on par with Zhou Hao, the ambush had caught him completely off guard. He’d been humiliated, struck before he could even circulate his qi.\n\nAs he tried to stand, Zhou Hao stepped forward, ready to strike again.\n\nBut before he could land the second blow, a man in a black suit appeared between them, placing himself silently in front of Ning Zhe.\n\nAn immense pressure blanketed the room.\n\nThis tale has been unlawfully obtained from Royal Road. If you discover it on Amazon, kindly report it.\nThe man’s aura was sharp and suffocating.\n\nA Dark Realm warrior.\n\nFrom the lounge, Gu Jun raised an eyebrow, mildly amused.\n\n“That must be Ning Zhe’s bodyguard,” he murmured to himself. The man’s eyes, cold as ice, locked onto Zhou Hao. His killing intent surged forward in a crushing wave.\n\nZhou Hao staggered slightly, forced to take several steps back.\nBut before the situation could tip further, another man appeared beside Zhou Hao, seemingly stepping out of thin air.\n\nAlso cloaked in pressure.\nAlso, a Dark Realm cultivator.\n\nZhou Hao’s bodyguard.\n\nThe atmosphere snapped tight.\nInvisible sparks seemed to fly between the opposing forces. The dance floor of a nightclub had become the stage for a high-level standoff.\n\nAs if in answer, several more figures began emerging from the shadows, each one stepping forward silently, protectors belonging to different factions, taking positions behind their respective charges.\n\nThe room was now locked in a chilling silence.\n\nEven the average guests, ignorant of cultivation levels, could feel it, the crushing weight in the air, the invisible tide of danger hanging over them.\n\nNot a single word was spoken.\n\nAnd through it all, Gu Jun sat quietly, sipping his drink.\n\nHis expression was calm and thoughtful.\n\nAs the pressure churned around him, his thoughts drifted, not to the current drama, but to the assassination attempt from his twelfth year.\n\nIf the Ning family were involved… then they’d made a mistake that they wouldn’t survive.\n\nHe tapped a finger lightly against his glass.\n\nHe’d have to revisit the Capital Plan.\n\nAnd so, while tension hung in the air like a blade ready to fall, the only sound in the entire nightclub…was the soft clink of Gu Jun’s glass, which is very loud in this silent situation.\n\nSome time later, he came back to his senses.\nAlmost all of them were looking at him.\nEspecially Bai Xue, there was fire in her eyes.\nNing Hao glared at him with barely restrained anger, and in the eyes of his roommates and companions, there was clear surprise.\n\nGu Jun gave them an embarrassed look, then cleared his throat and said,\n“Don’t mind me. Please, carry on.”\n\n“You little...”\nThe fury in Ning Zhe’s eyes only grew more intense.\n\nZhou Hao did not give him the chance to continue; he snapped,\n“Shut up, you bastard! You’ve got some nerve showing your face after cheating my cousin. I searched all over Tianhai for you. Now you're a dog-like thing, show up here brazenly and act like nothing happened?”\n\nNing Zhe then replied with a slight smirk.\n“Look who it is… the cousin of that bitch.”\n\nGu Jun turned to Li Ming with a questioning glance.\n\nLi Ming leaned in slightly and replied,\n“Your Highness, Zhou Hao is one of the potential successors of the Holy Light Sect. He is the illegitimate son of an elder. Right now, his faction controls the sect, but his status is still weak despite his high talent due to his birth. He was sent to Tianhai as the local head of the sect’s influence, but in truth, this was likely a move to push him out of the internal power struggle. There may be other motives, but we haven’t confirmed them yet.”\n\n“Holy Light Sect, huh…” Gu Jun muttered.\n\nIn the current structure of power on Earth, influence came in several forms, but in country X, there are two primary forms: Family and Sect.\nWithin the country X, the top of the hierarchy was occupied by the Ten Noble Families and the Seven Great Sects.\nThe Holy Light Sect ranked somewhere in the middle among the seven, but it was undeniably more powerful than the Ning family.\n\nLi Ming continued,\n“A few days ago, the granddaughter of the Grand Elder from the Holy Light Sect traveled to the capital. She carried with her a rare, high-grade ginseng. Ning Hao pretended to like her, gained her trust, and tricked her into handing it over.”\n\n“That girl lacked social experience, and her companions, just bodyguards, stood aside, hoping she’d gain some real-world experience. As a result, a minor conflict broke out between the Ning family and the sect over the matter. Ning Hao had to pay a penalty, but the incident was officially recorded as a transaction, even if it was deceptive; it happened with consent.”\n\nLi Ming’s voice lowered.\n\n“The girl has a close relationship with Zhou Hao, so it’s not surprising he’s furious. But more importantly… we suspect a third party was behind the entire incident. Someone wanted to drive a wedge between the Holy Light Sect and the Ning family. Although the plan ultimately failed, it came dangerously close to succeeding.”\n\nLi Ming paused and glanced at Gu Jun with a slightly hesitant look.\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"The younger sister of your fiancée, she is also your mother’s adopted daughter.\"\n\nGu Jun became distracted again and accidentally made a loud sipping sound.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Hao and Ning Zhe were on the verge of an all-out clash when that unsightly sipping sound once again broke the tension and disrupted the atmosphere.\n\nEveryone turned toward the source.\n\nGu Jun looked up from his drink and met their gazes.\nWith an apologetic smile, he said,\n\"Sorry again. Please, ignore me. You guys can continue.\"",

            "content": "In the nightclub, on the central stage, the tension was razor-sharp.\n\nNing Zhe and Zhou Hao stood locked in a silent stare, their killing intent palpable.\n\nThen Zhou Hao spoke, his voice steady but cold.\n\n“It seems we’ve reached an impasse. But I can’t just let this go. You made my sister cry. So here’s what we’re going to do: you and I fight, and we end our grudge here. After that, I won’t bother you again.”\n\nNing Zhe scoffed.\n\n“Are you stupid? Why should I fight you?”\n\nZhou Hao’s expression didn’t change.\n\n“You’ll fight me whether you want to or not. You don’t really have a choice.”\n\nHe stepped forward slightly.\n\n“Do you know why I’m in Tianhai? Because I was exiled by my sect. Now I manage their influence and industries here.”\n\nNing Zhe narrowed his eyes.\n\n“So?”\n\n“So you can say I am already at my lowest point, I have nothing to lose, ” Zhou Hao replied. “But you do. If you don’t fight me, I’ll declare war on the Tianhai branch of Ning Corporation. There will be a life and death war between Tianhai Ning corporation and the Holy Light sect's influence in all corners of Tianhai, light and dark. You might be powerful here, but I can still make you bleed. You’re standing on a foundation. I’m standing on nothing, and I fear nothing. I’ll take this as far as it goes.”\n\nHe continued, voice sharp.\n\n“You screw up here, and there’ll be plenty of people waiting to drag you down. That ‘potential heir’ status of yours? Fragile. You just got out of a scandal, and your family already paid for your last screw-up. You want to start another mess so soon? I’m barefoot, Ning Zhe. I don’t fear wearing shoes.”\n\nNing Zhe chuckled darkly.\n\n“You think your sect will let you go this far?”\n\nZhou Hao shrugged.\n\n“Maybe not. But are you willing to take that chance?”\n\nNing Zhe fell silent.\nTruth be told, he was furious with Xiao Hao. That idiot couldn’t keep it in his pants and created this entire mess. Now Ning Zhe was tangled up in it. He and his father had plans to cooperate with Xiao Hao’s family line, and now it was spiraling out of control.\n\nEveryone waited for his reply.\n\nFinally, Ning Zhe muttered through clenched teeth,\n\n“Fine. You are ruthless. I’ll fight. But if you think I’m weak just because your sneak attack was a success, you’re dead wrong. I’ll make you regret this.”\n\n“If you think you can, then try,” Zhou Hao answered coolly.\n\n“Gladly.”\n\nBoth of them gave subtle signals to their bodyguards, who stepped back and melted into the shadows in front of the stunned eyes of the people.\n\nAll nonessential personnel were cleared from the stage. This was one of the largest nightclubs in Tianhai, and it was just barely big enough for two peak Bright Strength warriors to fight without wrecking the entire building.\n\nZhou Hao and Ning Zhe stood ten meters apart, facing each other.\n\nNo one moved.\n\nThey waited; silent, focused, calculating.\n\nThen, as if on cue…\n\nThey both launched forward, together.\n\nOn the other side of Tianhai...\n\nNinth Elder Longxuan received a message on his most secure red phone.\nHe hurriedly pulled it out and checked the message.\n\n“Your Highness has initiated the plan. It's early, but not a problem.”\n\nWithout wasting a moment, he made a joint call to two people, the head of the Hong family and the current leader of the Imperial Bull Gang, Hong Biao.\n\nThe message was clear:\nToday is the day the Wang family falls to fifth place, and the Hong family rises to take their position.\n\nA case of content theft: this narrative is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.\n\nIn the heart of Tianhai City…\n\nAt the center of the business district stood a fifty-story skyscraper. A large nameplate gleamed under the sunlight: Wang Investment. It was not only the core of the Wang family’s financial empire but also one of the most powerful investment firms in the entire city.\n\nNow, panic gripped the company.\n\nTheir stock was plummeting rapidly, already down 30%.\nOn the top floor, in the president’s office, a man sat smoking one cigarette after another.\nHis mind was racing, thoughts spinning like a tornado.\n\n“Who is it?”\n“Who’s taking action against Wang Investment?”\n“Is this just about the company… or is someone targeting the entire Wang family?”\n\nSuddenly, a stunning woman entered the room without knocking.\n\nThe man looked at her with irritation.\nOn any other day, he might have welcomed the distraction. After all, she was not just his secretary but also his pleasure companion.\nBut not today.\n\nToday was a battlefield.\n\n“President Wang, there’s bad news.”\n\nThis man was Wang Chen—the current president of Wang Investment and the father of Wang Wei.\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Hong Corp is buying our shares aggressively. Their equity has already reached nearly 18%.”\n\n“Impossible. They don’t have that kind of liquidity.”\n\n“It’s true, President.”\n\nAfter a pause, Wang Chen exhaled slowly.\n“…Alright. You may go.”\n\nAs the door closed behind her, his face grew darker.\n\nWho is it? It should not be the Hong family. Although the Hong family has been in the limelight recently, they do not have the capability to do this. Do not say the current Hong family, even if they are two times powerful, they can't create this problem for the Wang Investment. Is somebody or some other power using the Hong family as a front?\n\nHe picked up his phone and made a call.\n\nThe person on the other side answered immediately.\n\n“Hmm, I’ve heard that from the outside, it looks like the Hong family is behind this. But there’s a shadow; other forces are involved.”\n\n“Where did they get the money?”\n\nThere was a pause on the other end of the call.\nThen came the reply:\n\n“It’s the Eastern Bank.”\n\nIt felt like a bomb had gone off in Wang Chen’s chest.\nThings had just become far more serious.\n\nThe Eastern Bank?\n\nOne of the most powerful financial institutions in the world.\nOne of the feared Thirty-Three.\n\nHow did they get involved?\n\nThe voice on the other end continued,\n“I’ve heard that the Rong family, the Bai family, and a few other business and underworld factions went to the Eastern Bank’s Tianhai branch, together with the Hong family. They convinced the branch manager to approve a large loan. And it worked.”\n\n“Why didn’t we know about this earlier?”\n\n“That’s on us. I caught wind of something, but I didn’t realize the situation was this critical.”\n\n“We can’t do anything directly right now. Can you stop the money flow?”\n\n“I might be able to. But it’ll be dangerous, far riskier than what we’re facing now.”\n\n“Fine. I’m calling Dad. Maybe we can ask the Xiao family for help.”\n\n“Alright. But be careful. Don’t push too hard, you know why.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nAlthough the Hong family held a clear advantage for now, there was a limit.\n\nIf a company were attacked too aggressively and its share price dropped, especially without clear regulatory violations and reason, higher government institutions might step in to stabilize the economic system. They will also punish some undisciplined parties for the market instability.\n\nBut for Wang Chen, this wasn’t just business, it was personal.\nHis pride was on the line. He had to act.\n\nThe person on the other end of the line was Wang Zhi, Wang Chen’s brother.\nHe was the head of the Financial and Banking Regulation Commission of Tianhai, a powerful and influential person.\n\nJust after he ended the call with Wang Chen, his phone rang again.\nWang Zhi answered, and after hearing what was said from the opposite side, his expression instantly changed.\n\nMeanwhile, Wang Chen made another call, this time to his father, the head of the Wang family.\n\nThey needed to act fast.\n\nThe Xiao Family — the most powerful family in Tianhai.\n\nThe Xiao family estate is located on the eastern side of Tianhai. It spans several vast traditional villas, complete with horse fields, golf courses, and every luxury one could imagine. Anyone who enters this place can immediately feel the power, influence, and deep-rooted tradition of the people who live here.\n\nIn the middle villa, in a quiet meeting room, several people sat drinking tea.\nTension lingered under the calm surface.\n\nThen the man in the center of the room spoke:\n\n“What is your opinion on the Wang family situation? We need to decide within ten minutes.”",

            "content": "The strange thing was that nobody spoke for almost a full minute.\nAfter that, when the silence became unbearable, the eldest son finally broke it.\n\n“Dad, I think we should help the Wang family. They’re an old and established clan, while the Hong family is relatively new. If the Hong family's rise is too rapid, it might destabilize the current balance. We don’t know how much impact that could have. Also, if we assist the Wang family now, they may become more inclined toward us.\n\nThe other families, like the Rong and Bai, are making too much noise. They didn’t inform us before taking action, and we don’t know what kind of transactions they’re involved in. I think we should crush their plans.”\n\nThe head of the Xiao family, seated in the main chair, turned to look at his other two sons.\nThe middle child spoke next.\n\n“Father, I oppose taking any action. It’s too dangerous. We don’t have the full picture. Just because those family heads went to the Eastern Bank doesn’t mean the bank will lend them money. There could be other factors, other forces, or parties involved.\n\nWe shouldn’t blindly step into a situation where a member of the Order of Thirty-Three is involved.”\n\nThen the youngest son spoke.\n“Yes, Father, I don’t want us to get involved in this either. We don’t know what we’d be stepping into. Furthermore, I’ve heard there are other movements against the Wang family. That means another influence is surely involved.”\n\nThe head of the Xiao family looked at his youngest son with a mixture of scrutiny and admiration.\nIt was impressive that he knew there were other actions being taken against the Wang family, the information that Xiao family’s own networks hadn’t reported. A family like the Xiaos was highly structured; a member only knew what he was permitted to know. So the youngest son had clearly learned this from an outside source.\n\nIn truth, this was a delicate situation for the Xiao family.\nWhether or not to help the Wang family had never been up for a vote among the sons. The decision had already been made. He had only wanted to hear their thoughts.\n\nThen the head said,\n“Alright. We won’t help the Wang family. It’s not a life-or-death situation for them. They’ll survive. You may go.”\n\nAll three sons replied at once,\n“Okay, Dad.”\n\nThe head of the Xiao family then left the room and walked into a deeper part of the residence. After some time, he entered his father’s old study. No one was there.\nHe pressed a concealed button on the wall. A hidden passage opened.\nHe stepped inside.\n\nAt the end of the passage was a lift. He entered, and the lift began to descend. It sank forty feet underground before stopping.\nThe doors opened to a vast open chamber. Several cabins lined the walls, but in the center, an old man was seated.\nSuddenly, the old man opened his eyes.\nA terrifying pressure burst forth from him.\n\nThe Xiao family head immediately fell to his knees.\nHe was a Huajin-level cultivator, but even he couldn’t withstand it.\n\nThen the head said with difficulty, “Grandfather, it’s me.”\n\nYes, this man was the ancestor of the Xiao family. He had reached the peak of the Innate Realm’s middle stage.\n\n“Hmm, I can see that it’s you. So why are you here to disturb me?”\n\n“Respected Grandfather, here is the situation—”\n\nHe explained everything: the Wang family’s predicament and the Eastern Bank’s involvement.\n\nHonestly, if it were just the Wang family, there would’ve been no need to come here. But the Eastern Bank was different. It was one of the Thirty-Three. Any issue involving them required extreme caution.\n\nAnd then, there was the Gu Empire.\n\nAfter hearing it all, the ancestor remained silent for a while. Then he spoke:\n“Alright. You’re right. We should not get involved in this.”\n\nThe Xiao family head replied, “Although I know this is the right decision for our family, I still feel somewhat unwilling. We possess such great strength, both openly and in the shadows, yet we’re forced to back off when facing the Thirty-Three.”\n\nHe paused, then continued.\n“And then there’s the Gu Empire. We don’t know much about what they’re doing. I suspect they’ve been in contact with some of our family core members, especially my youngest son.\n\nHow else would he have known so quickly about the other actions being taken against the Wang family?\n\nI mean, what even is this Gu Empire? They’re not listed among the Thirty-Three. Where did they come from?\n\nOnce, they might have helped us… but now, it feels like they’re holding us back.\n\nThis narrative has been purloined without the author's approval. Report any appearances on Amazon.\n\nIf not for the threat they pose, I would’ve focused entirely on entering the Thirty-Three.”\n\nHe stopped again, his frustration slipping through. His usual calm was gone; he was venting in front of his grandfather.\n\nThe ancestor looked at him with a faint smile, tinged with helplessness.\n\nThen the head continued, “Grandfather, I don’t understand this Gu Empire. How powerful are they, really?\n\nNow they want to completely control our family. Why? We built this family with our own hands, nurtured it through hardships, and they think they can control it just by doing us a few favors.\n\nYou know I’ve already reached out to some powers within the Thirty-Three to confront the Gu Empire.\n\nMy sons are even working to build marital ties with members of the Thirty-Three.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIf we join forces with them, can we resist the Gu Empire?\nNo matter how powerful they are, surely they can’t be that powerful…”\n\nHe paused, then added,\n“Furthermore, if you can break through to the late stage of the Innate Realm, if my father can break through to the middle stage, and if I can reach the Innate level, we’ll have much more assurance.”\n\nThe ancestor gave him a nonchalant glance and said,\n“Don’t talk anymore. Leave.”\n\nThe head gave an embarrassed smile and replied,\n“Farewell, Grandfather.”\n\nAfter he left, the ancestor let out a long sigh and pulled out a digital tablet.\nIt was strange for someone like him to own one, but this tablet was different.\nThe entire casing was made of gold, gleaming like a priceless artifact.\nThe screen was of exceptional quality, and engraved on the back was a single number: Thirty-Three.\n\nThis was an official device issued by the Thirty-Three.\nVery few were ever made. All critical information and orders were delivered through it.\n\nThe ancestor powered on the device.\nThe home screen displayed several buttons. He tapped one.\nA list appeared, a list of names:\n\nThe Thirty-Three most powerful forces in the world.\n\nSome were known even to ordinary citizens of Country X—\nNames like the Zi Family, Han Family, Dongfeng Family, and the Eastern Bank.\n\nOthers remained hidden from public knowledge, though they too hailed from Country X:\nThe Medicine God Sect, the Shenfeng Sect, and the Yang Sect.\n\nIn total, seven powers from Country X had made it onto the list:\nThree families, three sects, and one bank.\n\nThe Xiao family’s ancestor stared at the names and let out another sigh.\n\nPeople believed the Xiao family was powerful, and it was.\nBut above them… were the names on this list.\n\nAny force that couldn’t enter this circle would never be truly secure.\n\nThese organizations now controlled nearly 50% of the world’s resources.\nThey influenced governments, commanded military units, manipulated the underworld, and dominated global business.\n\nBut their greatest asset was still their supernatural strength.\n\nTake the powers from Country X, for example:\nEach of the major sects or families had four to five Innate Realm warriors.\n\nThe Zi Family, of course, was a different case.\nThey had only three Innate cultivators—\nBut their political, military, and governmental reach made them untouchable.\n\nThe ancestor’s thoughts paused.\nNo… they now had four Innate cultivators.\nAlthough there were still some complications with the newest one.\n\nBut that woman, that dangerous woman—\nShe would surely succeed in fully integrating the new Innate into the Zi family.\n\nTruth be told, very few people could earn the admiration of the Xiao family ancestor.\nThat woman was one of them.\n\nThinking of her, the ancestor tapped a button on the tablet.\nSeveral images appeared on the screen.\n\nHe gazed at one in particular, a woman.\nStunning. Powerful. Dangerous.\n\nZi Feng, not just a titan in Country X, but one of the most formidable women in the entire world.\nThough only at the Dark Strength level, she manipulated the world like a chessboard.\n\nThen his attention shifted to another woman.\nShe was the second-in-command of the Shenfeng Sect.\nThough her position was technically subordinate, the sect master had been in closed-door cultivation for nearly a year, attempting to break through to the Innate Realm.\n\nSo, in practice, she now commanded the entire sect.\n\nWhile the overall strength of the Shenfeng Sect might still fall short of the Zi Family, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the world. After all, they were part of the Thirty-Three.\n\nHe scanned some other images in the list.\nEach one belonged to a woman.\nEach one is a member of the Thirty-Three.\n\nHe narrowed his eyes and exhaled slowly.\n“Hmm... women are becoming more and more terrifying.”",

            "content": "In another villa.\nThis one belonged to the eldest son of the Xiao family.\n\nFrom the study, the sound of a woman crying and being whipped echoed out.\nThen, silence.\n\nSome time later, a young woman in an office uniform stepped out of the room.\nHer face was flushed, and her expression was bitter.\nShe was the secretary of the eldest son, also his current primary pleasure companion.\n\nThen came another sound from the study.\nIt was the sound of something breaking, perhaps a cup or some accessory.\nAngry shouting followed.\nAnd then again, silence.\n\nInside the room, the eldest son, Xiao Lei, wore a bitter and angry expression.\n\nA few minutes later, his own eldest son, Xiao Rui, entered the study.\nXiao Rui was strikingly handsome, one of the top three young masters of Tianhai Royal University.\nA typical Prince Charming: sharp, confident, and magnetic.\nHe was also the elder brother of Xiao Hao.\n\n“What’s happening, Father? Why are you so angry?” he asked.\n\nXiao Lei snapped out of his thoughts. He calmed down, then recounted what had happened in the earlier meeting.\n\nXiao Rui looked puzzled.\n“So, Father, why are you so upset? Grandfather deciding not to help the Wang family doesn’t seem worth this much anger.”\n\nXiao Lei replied coldly,\n“That is part of it, yes, but not the main issue.\n\nWhat angers me is that Dad had already decided not to help the Wang family before the meeting. That entire gathering was just for show.\n\nI gave my opinion first, but he dismissed it, then approved the suggestions of my younger brothers.\n\nThat’s not just a disagreement. That was a signal.\n\nA signal for me to be careful.\n\nHe thinks I’m growing too influential.\n\nThis is a subtle move to suppress me.”\n\nXiao Rui’s eyes narrowed.\n“Are you sure, Dad?”\n\n“Yes,” Xiao Lei said firmly.\n\n“But why would he do that?”\n\n“Because I’ve been swaying too many elders toward cutting ties with that Gu Empire.”\n\n“Hmm... the Gu Empire. They were quiet for a long time, but now they’re making moves toward us.”\n\nTruth be told, the Gu Empire had remained silent for so long that many in the Xiao family believed it had been destroyed or had simply faded away.\n\nBut recently, they returned with leverage. A mighty one.\n\nThey controlled two of the most powerful Innate Tools of the Xiao family. If they truly wished to, those tools could be taken away from the Xiao family forever.\n\nXiao Rui frowned.\n“Grandfather still isn’t sure about confronting the Gu Empire, is he?”\n\nXiao Lei shook his head.\n“If they really do take control of those tools… the loss would be unimaginable.”\n\nHe then looked at his son and added,\n“So, here comes your duty. You have to pursue one of those girls and marry her. If you can do that, then your grandfather may also make the decision to confront the Gu Empire.\n\nAt that point, we’ll team up with the other Thirty-Three influences and fight back against the Gu Empire.\n\nOtherwise, there’s no chance. Our dream of becoming one of the Thirty-Three will remain just that, a dream.”\n\n“Father, if we stop resisting the Gu Empire, what do you think will become of us? Will we grow stronger?”\n\n“It doesn’t matter. In that case, no matter how powerful we become, someone will always be above us.\nAnd I don’t want that.”\n\n“Okay, Father. I’ll do my best.”\n\nHis mind then drifted toward two exceptional women, Bai Yue and Xia Qingyue.\nBoth had deep connections to the Thirty-Three.\n\nIf he could win over either of them, it would not only be a great feat for himself but also for the Xiao family.\nIt would almost guarantee that he’d become the next head of the family after his father. No one would be able to change that.\n\nOH, only if I can marry both.\n\nThere was a trace of saliva on the corner of his mouth.\n\nTianhai Royal University’s police station.\nIt was one of the most important in all of Tianhai.\n\nThe captain’s post was especially significant. Its importance could be seen from the fact that the position was directly overseen by the provincial police chief, and the captain’s rank was equivalent to that of a deputy city mayor.\n\nThere were only four such police stations in the entire Tianhai.\n\nSuddenly, three cars pulled up in front of the station.\n\nStolen from Royal Road, this story should be reported if encountered on Amazon.\nFrom their setup and license plates, it was clear they were government vehicles.\n\nA group of people stepped out and entered the station.\nSome of them showed their IDs and badges.\n\nThey came from different departments:\n\nThe Provincial Discipline Committee, The Audit Bureau, The Procurement Department, and The Provincial Legal Affairs Committee.\n\nEach quickly took their position inside the building.\n\nThen, four department heads entered the captain’s office.\n\n“Captain Leng, you are hereby suspended.\nYou must come with us for an official investigation.\n\nThere are charges against you, allegations that you have been aiding a criminal gang.\nAlso, you are suspected of suppressing reports related to multiple sexual misconduct incidents that happened at the Tianhai Royal University.”\n\nCaptain Leng felt as if he had fallen from the sky.\n\nHe was around forty years old.\nAlthough not related to the Wang family by blood, it was no secret within the inner circles that he was one of their most important pawns.\n\nAfter the initial surprise, Captain Leng quickly composed himself.\nAfter all, he had seen many things in his life.\n\nHe said, “Alright, I’ll go with you, but let me see your IDs first.”\n\nThey showed their identification.\n\nThen he said, “Okay, just let me make one phone call.”\n\n“Sorry. No phone calls. Also, I should tell you, the evidence is solid. You’re not walking away from this.”\n\nAcross Tianhai, similar operations were unfolding in secret.\n\nIn just forty minutes, several of the Wang family’s key pawns were taken down.\nIt was so sudden and well-coordinated that they had no time to react.\n\nLater…\n\nA high-level video conference was underway.\nTen participants were present:\n\nFive heads from first-class families, the First Elder of the Xiao family, one of the most powerful people of the Xiao family, three government officials, and one representative from the military.\n\nThe head of the Wang family wore an expression of anger and bitterness.\nHe glared at the others through the screen, his gaze especially sharp, almost venomous, when it landed on the head of the Hong family.\n\nThen he spoke:\n“So, why are you people doing this? Do you want to throw the entire situation into chaos?\n\nI understand that you’re trying to increase your influence, but isn’t this a bit too hasty?”\n\nAlthough his words sounded like those of a victim, there was a subtle note of threat in his voice.\n\nEven if they were cornered, the Wang family could still stir up massive unrest in Tianhai, and no one wanted that.\n\nThere had to be a limit to the suppression.\nAnd that limit had just been reached.\n\n“So tell me,” he said, “What are your terms? What will it take for you to stop?”\n\nAll eyes turned to the head of the Hong family.\n\nHe calmly replied,\n“The Tianhai Royal University district will now fall under the control of the Imperial Bull Gang.\n\nAs for the Wang investment's share, it can be returned, but only if you buy it back.\n\nAlso, you’re forbidden from entering into any future cooperation with Ning Corporation.”\n\nThe moment the Ning Corporation was mentioned, the First Elder of the Xiao family’s eyes narrowed sharply.\n\nInteresting…\nThis condition was revealing.\n\nThe Hong family clearly didn’t have the capability to oppose the Ning family on their own. Someone powerful was behind them. But who? The Eastern Bank? Another hidden hand?\n\nIt was well known that someone had backed the Hong family’s sudden rise.\n\nThe other families had long been trying to trace this mysterious influence.\nBut until now, they had found nothing.\n\nIt seems it’s time to start taking the investigation more seriously.\n\nThe head of the Wang family closed his eyes, trying to suppress his growing anger.\nThen, he turned to look at the government officials.\n\nOne of them spoke firmly,\n“The individuals who have been apprehended, none of them are going free. We have solid evidence against each of them. Frankly, it’s astonishing they were allowed to operate so freely for so long.\n\nYou should all remember:\nWhile there may be many powerful people and influential forces in Country X, no one is above the law.”\n\nHe did not say everything, nobody is above the law, but somebody can influence the creation of the law.\n\nThe Wang family head asked coldly,\n“What about Wang Zhi?”\n\n“He’s also made some mistakes,” the official replied.\n“Nothing too severe, but the evidence is solid.\nHe will be punished, transferred to another province in the same rank.\nHis second-in-command will temporarily take over his duties.”\n\nThe Wang family head turned and glared at the Hong family head, his eyes burning with fury.\n\nEveryone in the room knew, Wang Zhi’s second-in-command was from the Hong family. Although the Wang family head was aware of this, he was still enraged.\n\nIn fact, this was the Hong family’s main bargaining chip. They held serious blackmail material, and if they released it, Wang Zhi would be completely destroyed. It was a helpless move for them to send Wang Zhi far, and some government officials helped them save Wang Zhi.\n\nIn the end, the Wang family head said nothing.\n\nThe situation was unfolding too fast, too suddenly. Everything was confusing, chaotic.\n\nFor now, they needed to regroup, consolidate their strength, investigate the true cause behind the attacks, and search for a chance to retaliate.\nThey also had to reestablish contact with their allies.\n\nThe Wang family had been a dominant force in Tianhai for generations.\nIts roots ran deep, and no one dared to ignore them.\n\nThat this kind of assault had succeeded at all was a testament to how carefully and powerfully it had been orchestrated.\nUnder normal circumstances, it would have been nearly impossible to suppress them.\n\nWithout offering any closing words or pleasantries, the Wang family head left the meeting in silence.",

            "content": "At the same time…\nThe second-in-command of the Imperial Bull Gang, Hong Yun, stepped out of the gang's headquarters.\nHis mission: to take control of the newly conquered territory.\nAnd he had to move fast.\nIt wasn't enough to win ground; they had to break the enemy’s spirit.\n\nSoon after, Hong Yun and his men launched attacks on the nightclubs previously controlled by the Wang family.\n\nSome of the Wang family’s lower-tier operatives had already caught wind of the attacks, but the news hadn’t spread widely.\nThe result: they were caught off guard and hit hard.\n\nAfter a series of fierce battles and bloody skirmishes, all the establishments formerly under the Green Gang’s control fell into the hands of the Imperial Bull Gang.\n\nBut Hong Yun wasn’t focused on those victories.\nHis mind was fixed on one place.\nRedrose Nightclub.\nThe place where Gu Jun was.\n\nRedrose Nightclub\n\nNing Zhe and Zhou Hao were still fighting.\nThough they were going all out, their movements were precise,  a controlled brawl between two skilled fighters.\n\nNearly every decoration in the club had been destroyed.\nParts of the ceiling had collapsed, and much of the floor was cracked or shattered.\n\nBoth men were covered in blood.\nNing Zhe’s left leg was twitching unnaturally, clearly damaged. Zhou Hao’s right arm was bent at an unnatural angle, broken.\n\nThey had fought barehanded the entire time. If weapons had been involved, the damage would have been far worse.\n\nSuddenly, Ning Zhe stepped forward and threw a punch with his right fist.\nZhou Hao countered with an open palm.\n\nFist and palm collided.\nA thunderous sound echoed through the club.\n\nBoth men were blasted backward, skidding across the floor at terrifying speed.\n\nBlood trickled from Zhou Hao’s mouth.\nYet he wore a strange smile.\n\nEveryone in the club watched in stunned silence.\nEven Bai Xue and Rong Xi, both from prestigious noble families, were visibly shaken.\n\nBut the most helpless expressions belonged to Luo Yuxin and Zhao Ming.\nThey glanced at each other, completely lost.\n\nThe situation had escalated too quickly.\nThey were like rudderless ships in a violent storm, unable to decide what to do.\n\nThe only one who remained calm… was Gu Jun.\nIn fact, he looked like he was enjoying himself.\n\nAfter some time, both Zhou Hao and Ning Zhe slowly stood up.\nThey were badly injured now, their bodies covered in bruises and blood.\nThey stared at each other, tension still crackling in the air.\nZhou Hao looked ready for another round, while Ning Zhe’s priority had shifted; he wanted to end the fight.\n\nSuddenly, the sound of heavy footsteps echoed from outside the nightclub.\nEveryone turned toward the entrance.\nShouts and fighting noises could be heard coming from outside.\n\nMoments later, Hong Yun entered the club, followed by a group of men, all members of the Imperial Bull Gang.\n\nAt first, Hong Yun glanced around the chaotic scene with mild surprise.\nThen his gaze slowly swept over the people present…\nAnd finally landed on Gu Jun, where it paused for a few seconds.\n\nMost people didn’t notice this subtle moment.\nBut those with sharp instincts, like Ning Zhe and Zhou Hao, caught it.\n\nThen, Wang Hai stepped forward and glared at Hong Yun, demanding angrily,\n“Hong Yun, what the hell are you doing here?”\n\nHong Yun smirked.\n“Oh? I see… you haven’t heard the news. You might want to call your family. From now on, this nightclub belongs to the Imperial Bull Gang.”\n\n“What the fuck are you talking about?”\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense. Call your family.”\n\nWang Hai quickly pulled out his phone.\nTo his shock, there were several missed calls from his family.\n\nHe immediately called back.\n\nAfter a brief conversation, he lowered the phone slowly.\nHis face was pale, stunned by what he had just heard.\nHow could this happen so quickly? So suddenly?\nIt took him a long moment to regain composure.\n\nThen he looked up and said angrily,\n“Fine, I understand the situation. But if it were a peaceful transfer, there wouldn’t be a problem. Why the hell did you attack the Green Gang’s people?”\n\nHong Yun shrugged casually.\n\nLove this novel? Read it on Royal Road to ensure the author gets credit.\n“Oh, there’s a reason. It’s simple… I felt like it.”\n\n“Fuck you! I’ll kill you!”\n\nHong Yun chuckled darkly.\n“Heh. Do you really want to fight me now?”\n“You should know, the entire Tianhai Royal University district is now under our control. Your people already left, and since the government issued no interference, even the police didn’t stop us from taking over.”\n“If you fight now, you’ll get crushed, and no one will speak up for you. Honestly, I’d love to fight you in your current condition. Want proof?”\n\nThen, without warning, he spat, right in Wang Hai’s face.\nThe saliva landed directly on target.\n\nWang Hai’s eyes blazed with fury.\nHe roared like a wild beast… but did nothing.\n\nHe truly didn’t know what to do.\nIf he didn’t fight back, he’d lose face, especially in front of Xiao Hao and Ning Zhe.\nBut if he did fight, the odds were against him.\nAnd if he lost a leg or an arm… no one would step in to help him. His people had already retreated. He was alone.\n\nHe was caught in a painful dilemma.\n\nAt that moment, Xiao Hao looked over and asked,\n“What’s going on?”\n\nWang Hai replied quietly,\n“Something bad has happened. We’re being forced to leave this place.”\n\n“But why?”\n\nAt that moment, Hong Yun stepped forward and spoke with a smirk.\n“Because this is now our territory. And we don’t like your kind hanging around here.”\n\n“Really?”\nThe voice that answered was cold.\n“And if I decide to stay? Are you prepared to go against the Xiao family and the Ning family?”\n\nGu Jun clicked his tongue.\nSmart move.\nBringing up the Ning family added weight, a clever way to shift the balance.\n\nThen, Xiao Wei stepped in.\n“Do you really think you can speak for the Xiao family?”\n\nXiao Hao responded with a sneer.\n“Cousin, are you seriously standing against me and the Xiao family, for some outsider?”\n\nXiao Wei replied calmly,\n“I’m not standing against the Xiao family. I’m standing against you.”\n\nHong Yun lost patience.\n“Alright, enough with the talk. Now get the hell out.”\n\nSuddenly, a new voice echoed through the club:\n“Interesting… Someone in Tianhai actually dares to tell the heirs of both the Xiao and Ning families to ‘get the hell out.’ How bold.”\n\nEveryone turned as a figure stepped inside.\nIt was none other than Xiao Rui.\nThe moment he heard about the situation, he left his father’s study and came directly.\n\nHong Yun opened his mouth to speak, but the moment he saw who it was, he choked on his words.\nHowever, a heartbeat later, he forced himself to stay calm.\nAfter all, Gu Jun was here.\nHe didn’t know Gu Jun’s full identity, but he did know that Gu Jun was someone even more dangerous than Xiao Rui.\n\nHong Yun bowed slightly and said,\n“Apologies, Young Master Xiao. You understand that we have responsibilities. We respectfully request that your people leave this place.”\n\nXiao Rui chuckled coldly.\n“Oh, we’ll leave, but when we leave is entirely up to us.\nWe have unfinished business here. Or are you planning to use force against us?”\n\nThe moment Xiao Rui finished speaking, a figure in a black robe stepped into the room.\nImmediately afterward, a crushing pressure descended from above, filling the air.\n\nIt was a Peak Dark Level aura, which almost reached the semi-HuaJin, oppressive and suffocating.\n\nHong Yun, standing closest, took the brunt of it.\nHe nearly collapsed, his body trembling under the weight.\nBut he gritted his teeth and held firm.\nWith Gu Jun present, kneeling was not an option.\n\nXiao Rui narrowed his eyes and spoke slowly:\n“You should never forget your place. Who gave you the courage to speak so rudely to the Xiao and Ning families?”\n“Your backer? Then call him. I’d love to see if he’s strong enough to save you.”\n\nJust when the situation was becoming more and more complicated, a new voice rang out.\nIt was sweet, yet carried a slightly cold undertone.\n\n“What’s happening here?”\n\nSuddenly, all the worry vanished from Bai Xue’s face. She cried out in relief,\n“Sister! At last, you’re here!”\n\nIt was Bai Yue.\n\nThe expressions of both Xiao Rui and Ning Zhe lit up with excitement.\nIf anyone were to ask, \"Who is the most desirable companion among noble families in Tianhai?\"\nThe answer would likely be either Bai Yue or Xia Qingyue.\n\nAnd now, Bai Yue had arrived.\n\nAll the stern authority Xiao Rui had shown against Hong Yun vanished in an instant.\nHe now stood as the picture of elegance, the classic, refined young master from a noble family.\n\nNing Zhe, on the other hand, didn’t rely on elegance. His charm came from raw manliness.\nHis body and face were already bloodied, which strangely added to his appeal.\n\nHe looked at Bai Yue coolly and said,\n“Oh. Hello, Yue.”\n\nXiao Rui turned to Ning Zhe with raw hostility.\nNing Zhe returned the same look, a silent battle of pride and presence. It was a battle of taking the dominant position in front of Bai Yue.\n\nMeanwhile, Gu Jun watched the unfolding scene with amusement.\nHe had just learned of Bai Yue’s identity, and it was indeed impressive.\n\nShe was the daughter of the second-in-command of the Shenfeng Sect.\nIn truth, Bai Yue’s mother was naw a very influential figure, with rumors swirling that she might become the next sect master once the current one advanced to the Innate Realm.\nThat would make her the leader of one of the Thirty-Three Great Influences.\nAnd Bai Yue? She was her only daughter.\n\nBai Xue was her half-sister.\n\nGu Jun watched it all quietly, deep in thought. Then he muttered,\n“So, Li Ming… Xiao Rui is the son of the rebel leader. The Ning family might be linked to my assassination. My mother has already arranged a fiancé for me. And we also need more influence in the Shenfeng Sect. How about we complicate things a little… and solve all four problems at once?”\n\nLi Ming’s voice responded quietly,\n“Your Highness… what exactly do you intend to do?”\n\nGu Jun smiled.\n“Hmm. Just stand here and watch.”\n\nAt that moment, Xiao Rui and Ning Zhe were locked in a silent stare-down.\nBai Yue was thinking hard about how to mediate and resolve the situation peacefully.\n\nEveryone around was hopeful, expecting diplomacy and calm.\n\nThen, a new voice cut through the tension like a blade.\n\n“Wife, you’re finally here? I’ve been waiting forever! I called you so many times. I was so scared! You’ll have to compensate me… with a long and wet kiss.”\n\nA hand reached out and wrapped gently around Bai Yue’s slender waist.\n\nThe entire room froze.\n\nMouths opened. Eyes widened.\n\nAnd then,\nRong Xi broke the silence first.\n\n“…Fuck.”\n\nFollowed by Bai Xue.\n\n“Fuck. Fuck.”\n\nAnd finally, Xiao Wei, raising the stakes—\n\n“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.”",

            "content": "Xiao Rui and Ning Zhe both stared at Gu Jun, stunned.\nThen they reacted at the same time.\n\n“Who are you? How dare you touch her?”\n“Let her go!”\n\nGu Jun replied with a smirk, “Oh? Seeing how intimate we are, shouldn't it be obvious what our relationship is? But since you two are a bit slow, I’ll spell it out for you: I’m her naughty fox, and she’s my little bunny.”\n\nXiao Rui and Ning Zhe nearly spat blood.\n\nGu Jun then noticed that Bai Yue was about to resist.\nShe was trying to break free, struggling to escape his grip on her waist.\n\nGu Jun quickly leaned in close to her ear and whispered,\n“Listen, what I’m doing right now is for your own good. Don’t you get annoyed with all the people constantly trying to woo you? Think of me as a shield; this will keep them at bay. Blink twice if you agree. Actually, even if you disagree, you’ll have to go along with it. Otherwise, I’ll kiss you, right here, right now. A long, wet kiss. Trust me, I will. And your noble status won’t stop me.”\n\nBai Yue looked at Gu Jun, breathing hot and angry, with fire in her eyes.\nShe remembered the quiet, rural boy from the train.\nHow did he change so much in such a short time? How did he become such an ashole?\n\nAlthough she was genuinely furious, to everyone else, it looked like a flirtatious stare.\n\nSeeing that her fiery glare had no effect, she finally blinked twice, helplessly.\nIn her mind, she was now cursing all of Gu Jun’s ancestors.\n\n“Don’t be so angry. I’ll explain everything to you later, okay?” he added playfully.\n\nGu Jun knew there were many Dark Stage warriors around who could overhear them, so he used a sound-isolation tool to block the conversation.\n\nAlmost everyone in the room was now glaring at Gu Jun with anger.\nBut Gu Jun only found amusement in the faces of Xiao Rui and Ning Zhe.\n\nWhy?\nBecause they desperately wanted to curse him with the vilest words possible, but couldn’t.\nThey had to maintain their image. If they lost their cool now, their chances with Bai Yue would vanish for good.\n\nAfter a while, Bai Yue composed herself and turned toward Xiao Rui and Ning Zhe.\nShe spoke calmly,\n\n“I’m taking everyone out of here. Any objections?”\n\nXiao Rui and Ning Zhe were still glaring at Gu Jun with vicious eyes as they bitterly said,\n“Fine. No problem.”\n\nAfter that, all the guests, including Xiao Rui and Ning Zhe, left the nightclub.\n\nOnce the place was almost empty, and only a few people remained outside, Bai Yue finally pulled herself out of Gu Jun’s grasp.\nShe turned to him and said coldly,\n“I’m going home. And don’t forget, you owe me an explanation.”\n\nIt was nearly 10 PM.\nBai Yue was on her way home.\n\nShe didn’t actually live in the Bai family residence.\nNot because of any issues with her father, she simply preferred living alone for privacy.\n\nTonight, Bai Xue and Rong Xi had also decided to stay with her at her private residence.\n\nAs their car neared the house, a vehicle suddenly emerged from the shadows and blocked their path.\nEveryone in Bai Yue’s car grew tense. The bodyguards immediately prepared to act.\n\nMoments later, a slender leg stepped out of the mysterious car, clad in sleek leather pants.\nA woman walked straight toward Bai Yue’s vehicle.\n\nBai Yue’s bodyguards quickly got out and confronted her.\nBut the woman calmly said,\n“I want to speak with Miss Bai.”\n\nAt that moment, the car windows rolled down.\n\nThe woman repeated,\n“Miss Bai, someone wants to meet with you.”\n\nBai Yue said nothing.\nBut Rong Xi, hot-tempered as always, snapped,\n“Why should Sister Bai go with you?”\n\nIn response, the woman removed her mask and sunglasses.\n\nBai Yue’s eyes narrowed slightly in surprise.\nThis woman was stunning, no less beautiful than Bai Yue herself.\n\nBai Yue responded firmly,\n“You do realize it’s almost midnight, and I don’t even know who you are. Why would I go with you?”\n\nThis story is posted elsewhere by the author. Help them out by reading the authentic version.\n\nThe woman gave a calm smile.\n“Miss Bai, come on now. You’re the daughter of the Bai family. More importantly, you’re the daughter of the second-in-command of the Shenfeng sect, and the granddaughter of a central leader.”\n\n\"You shouldn’t have much to fear in the whole of China. But if someone like you is afraid of a harmless girl like me, then I can only say… sorry.\"\n\nThen she pulled out a badge.\n\"You should recognize this.\"\n\nBai Yue looked at the badge with a flicker of surprise.\nShe thought to herself,\n“Who wants to see me at this hour? And why?”\n\nThe woman answered coolly,\n“Sorry, that’s not for me to say. He will tell you himself.”\n\nBai Yue had no real hesitation.\nShe knew that badge well; it belonged to the Red Guards, elite central government agents tasked with protecting VIPs.\nThey only guarded people connected to national security.\n\nBesides, Bai Yue had her own powerful Huajin-level tool for protection.\n\nStill, although she wasn’t afraid, she did feel uncomfortable around this woman.\nThere was no killing intent, but there was a strange hostility, something cold beneath her beauty.\n\nThe woman then turned to the others.\n\"You two can go back. The person only wants to see Miss Bai. And Miss Bai, your bodyguards can come with you.\"\n\nBai Yue nodded.\n\"Bai Xue, Rong Xi, you two head back.\"\n\nThe woman added with a faint smile,\n“Yes, I’ll return Miss Bai in one piece. You don’t need to worry.”\n\nThe two girls replied in unison,\n“Alright, Sister, come back soon. Tonight was exciting, and the ending is… kinda weird.”\n\nThe woman in leather pants didn’t respond with words, just chuckled softly.\n\nThen she gestured toward the darkened street.\nTwo more cars slowly emerged from the shadows.\n\nBai Yue’s eyes narrowed as she recognized one of them.\nThis car… she thought.\nIt was one of the highest-security vehicles in the country, built from a classified metal alloy used in top-tier fighter jets and submarines.\nHer grandfather and mother had access to such a vehicle; even her father didn’t.\n\nAfter Bai Yue and the leather-pants woman got in the car, the convoy began moving.\nThe last car was for Bai Yue’s bodyguards.\n\nThe journey was incredibly smooth.\nWith the Red Guards’ escort vehicle in front, all other traffic made way without delay. This sort of VIP treatment was rare, even for her.\n\nBai Yue tried to guess their destination from the direction of the roads.\nShe didn’t have to wait long; the trip was short.\n\nAnd when they arrived… Bai Yue was surprised.\n\nIt wasn’t a hidden or secret location.\nIn fact, it was one of the most iconic landmarks in Tianhai, the tallest building in the city.\n\nThe headquarters of the Eastern Bank’s Tianhai branch.\n\nBai Yue pondered again,\n“Who wants to see me? I don’t have any connection to the Eastern Bank…”\n\nThey entered the elevator.\nIt took nearly two minutes before it reached the top floor.\n\nBai Yue looked around.\nIt was clearly the highest floor, likely the chairman’s office or that of one of the top executives.\nThrough the glass walls, she could see the beautiful night view of the seductive, glowing Tianhai City.\n\nThe woman in leather pants walked ahead and opened a door, but it wasn’t an office.\nIt was a luxurious private suite.\n\n“Alright, she’s here. Tell her whatever you want to say. I’ll wait outside.”\n\n“Thank you, Di Yan.”\n\nThe only response from Di Yan was a light snort.\n\nThen a familiar voice rang out:\n“Hello, wife. We meet again.”\n\nYes, it was Gu Jun, sitting comfortably on the sofa, a wine glass in hand.\n\nThis time, Bai Yue was truly shocked.\nSo shocked that she couldn’t speak for a long while.\n\nHer mind went back to the quiet village boy from the train, the one Rong Xi had half-jokingly accepted as a junior brother.\n\nNow… if she still couldn’t see that Gu Jun was no ordinary person, then she didn’t deserve her reputation as the \"academic bully\" of Tianhai.\n\nShe finally asked,\n“What’s your relationship with the Eastern Bank?”\n\nDue to her status, she knew a bit about the Thirty-Three Great Influences.\nAnd even among them, no one dared to provoke the Eastern Bank lightly.\n\nGu Jun didn’t answer directly.\nInstead, he said,\n“I told you I’d give you an explanation.”\n\n“I’m listening.”\n\n“From now on, you’ll be my girlfriend, at least in front of others.\nWhether we become a real couple… well, that depends on the future.”\n\n“Why do you think I would agree to that?”\n\n“Because I believe you’re in a dangerous position right now.\nMany powerful people are watching you, and most of them don’t have good intentions.\nYou might think your mother is secure in her position, but the truth is… she’s walking a fine line.\nHer situation isn’t as stable as it seems.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Although your mother is the top candidate to become the next Sect Master of the Shenfeng Sect, her biggest weakness is her cultivation level.\nEven though she’s the most talented among the contenders, cultivation strength is a decisive factor.\nAnd right now… she’s falling behind.”\n\n“Also, your grandfather is in a difficult position right now. The Han family is eyeing him closely. If they get the chance, they’ll drag him down from his pedestal.\n\nAnd then there's the Bai family. You know the Xiao family is becoming more and more aggressive in their attempt to control Tianhai City. They could strike at any time.”\n\n“But do you know what the worst-case scenario is?\nAll your enemies are joining forces and attacking at once.\nAlthough it may be almost impossible, if that happens… you could lose everything in a matter of hours.”\n\n“Now, I can help you in this situation.\nIf you agree to act as my girlfriend, I promise the Eastern Bank will back you in all three situations.”\n\n“I’ll also shield you from those annoying suitors who keep pestering you.”",

            "content": "“So, what do you think?”\n\nBai Yue wanted to reply, but as soon as she opened her mouth, Gu Jun stopped her.\n\n“You know what, since we’re talking about relationships, I think I should explain why I chose you, and why I need a lover in the first place.”\n\nGu Jun paused, then added, “Actually, my mother is planning to set me up with a fiancée, and I’m not okay with that. So I need a lover, and in all of Tianhai, you’re the only one I know who can counter that woman.”\n\nAfter saying this, Gu Jun stood up, poured a drink, and handed the glass to Bai Yue.\n\nBai Yue was now looking at him with laughter and amusement in her eyes.\n\n“If you really agree to act with me, you have to be extremely careful. Whether it's my mother or my future fiancée, neither of them is an easy person to deal with. Your performance has to be flawless.”\n\nGu Jun took another pause and added, “By the way, my fiancée is one of the youngest innate-level warriors in all of Country X.”\n\nHearing this, Bai Yue almost spat out her drink.\n\nInnate-level? That was the dream stage of every cultivator on Earth. Nobody, absolutely nobody in the whole earth dares to take an innate cultivator lightly; they were the real power holders behind the curtain, at the top of the food chain.\n\nAfter some moments, she was finally able to compose herself. Although she was stunned, she felt a strange excitement in her heart.\n\n“So why don’t you marry her? Are you afraid of her?”\n\n“You don’t need to know that,” Gu Jun replied. “If you agree, I’ll instruct the Eastern Bank to help your mother, your grandfather, and the Bai family. I know you're very intelligent, but right now you’re powerless to help your relatives. I'm giving you this chance, and you’re not losing anything except a bit of mental peace. It’s a win-win deal. So, what do you think?”\n\nBai Yue fell silent for a full five minutes.\nThen she said, “Okay. I agree.”\n\n“Good.”\n\nThen the door opened. A man in his fifties entered the room. Bai Yue recognized him immediately; he was a well-known figure in Tianhai, the president of the Tianhai Eastern Bank branch.\n\nGu Jun looked at him and said,\n“From now on, you will take care of the Bai family. Manage their finances and ensure their security. This order remains in effect unless they do something that goes against morality.”\n\nThe president said nothing. He only nodded.\n\nAfter some time, Bai Yue left for her home, and Di Yan followed her.\n\nAfter that, only Gu Jun remained. He gave a subtle signal, and the hidden people around him quietly withdrew.\n\nNow, Gu Jun was truly alone.\n\nAfter a long pause, he began to speak.\n\n“Do you think I’m showing weakness? Do you think I’m afraid of my mother just because she showed me goodwill?”\n\nSuddenly, another presence appeared in the room. It was Xuanzhi.\n\nHe said,\n“Maybe it is showing weakness, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Do you think having weaknesses is shameful? Let me ask you this: who doesn’t have weakness? Our dark warriors, our assassins? We created them to follow orders. They lack independent thought.\n\nThroughout human history, every great emperor had their own weaknesses. Their journey was never easy. Having weaknesses and overcoming them is the Imperial Way.\n\nYou have several weaknesses. One of them is your mother. You have a complex relationship with her. You don’t want to get close to her, but you also don’t want to cut ties. You're caught in a dilemma. But if you can navigate through this, you’ll gain valuable insights. It will strengthen your resolve.\n\nI won’t tell you what to do. You're still in the learning phase, not yet in true danger.”\n\nHe paused for a moment, then added:\n\n“In fact, there are some powerful people who are concerned that your rise has been too smooth. If you can’t convince them, they won’t support you, and your future progress will face resistance. On the other hand, they don’t want to openly oppose the Imperial Way, so they’ve prepared some surprises for you.”\n\nStolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\n\nXuanzhi then looked at Gu Jun deeply and said,\n\n“You should know, your eighteenth year and seventy-first day is approaching. That marks the universal age of adulthood. At that time, your fate tribulation will begin, and you’ll lose most of your Dao protection. The surprises prepared by those people will also take effect. So be ready.”\n\nFor some reason, a chill crept up Gu Jun’s spine. He hadn’t felt such unease in a long time.\n\nIt took him a while to calm down. By then, Xuanzhi had already vanished.\n\nAfter a few moments, someone entered the room. He appeared to be around thirty-five years old, energetic and striking, nearly six feet tall.\n\nBut most striking of all was his presence. His aura shifted like a blade in one moment and a calm sea the next.\n\nThe reason for this is that the person was standing on a threshold, the border between late-stage innate and peak innate level.\n\nGu Jun looked at him and said, “You should go into seclusion for the breakthrough.”\n\n“Yes, Your Highness, I will soon. I just came because I haven’t seen you in a long time. So I thought, before closing up, I should visit you.”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nGu Jun looked at him with a complicated expression.\n\nThis person was named Longtian. He was the First Elder of the Gu Empire. He also served as the head of the Planning Council, the Empire’s Finance Manager, and the controller of the Eastern Bank.\n\nAfter a few moments, Gu Jun left. He didn’t say much to the people of the Eastern Bank, just one phrase:\n“Take care.”\n\nNow, Gu Jun was walking down a street at night. He was heading to the residence Uncle Tang had arranged for him, as the university dormitory was already closed. Truth be told, it was supposed to be his first night staying there, and he had wanted to sleep in the dorm, but things had come up.\n\nGu Jun looked up at the night sky. Then he glanced toward the Eastern Bank skyscraper and felt a rush of mixed emotions.\n\nHe knew very well that many things were beyond his control, and there were still many things he didn’t understand. There were likely old powerhouses, those fossils, who didn’t care about him, didn’t value him, or simply wanted to manipulate him. Some were likely within the solar system; others, perhaps, beyond it.\n\nThinking this, Gu Jun gave a soft chuckle.\n\n“But they’ve made a mistake, or forgotten something. Maybe it’s because they’re too obsessed with so-called fate or divine mechanics. They’ve forgotten why I was chosen as heir to the throne.\n\nYes, I will grow by overcoming my weaknesses. But if anyone thinks they can manipulate me easily, they will soon learn what it truly means to walk the IMPERIAL WAY.”\n\nGu Jun was now hungry. Strangely, he didn’t have much money on him.\n\nHe soon saw a group of people sitting at a roadside noodle stall, most of them bikers, with a few security guards as well.\n\nOne of them called out to him,\n“Hey, kid! Why are you walking around alone at this hour? You look like a decent college or university student. Are you hungry?”\n\nGu Jun replied,\n“Yes, I’m hungry... but I don’t have much money.”\n\n“OK, no problem. Come here, we’ll cover your bill.”\n\nGu Jun then learned that these bikers were from the military and currently on vacation, so they had come out together to enjoy themselves.\n\nAfter eating, Gu Jun resumed walking. He was deep in thought, thinking about the writings of that great book:\n\nAN EMPEROR CAN LAUGH,\nAN EMPEROR CAN LOVE,\nBUT\nAN EMPEROR CANNOT TRUST,\nBECAUSE THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH,\nAND\n\nTHE EMPEROR IS ALWAYS ALONE.\n\nIf any of you want to use me or try to manipulate my decisions, I will give you a great surprise one day.\n\nSuddenly, Gu Jun felt a tingling sensation in his heart. He immediately looked up at the sky. The feeling seemed to be coming from above, or more precisely, from the full moon.\n\nGu Jun stared at the moon and muttered,\n“Don’t worry. I’ll come for you soon.”\n\nHe then slowly made his way toward his house. His shadow stretched along the street, cast by the silver moonlight. Somewhere, music was playing, softly, mysteriously, but no one knew where it was coming from.\n\nMeanwhile, Bai Yue had reached home.\n\nUnder the questioning eyes of Rong Xi and Bai Xue, she quietly entered her room.\n\nShe took out her secured satellite phone and made a call.\n\nTruth be told, she didn’t have a good relationship with her father or mother. In the family, the only person she regularly spoke to was her grandfather, who lived in the capital.\n\nHer grandfather picked up the phone.\n\n“My sweet granddaughter, why are you calling at midnight? Aren’t you going to sleep?”\n\n“Grandfather, I heard that the Han family is targeting you again.”\n\nHer grandfather paused for a moment, then replied,\n“Where did you hear that?”\n\nBai Yue then explained what had happened. She knew the matter needed to be kept secret, but she had to tell her grandfather to find out whether there was any risk involved or not.\n\nHer grandfather replied,\n“Eastern Bank, huh? You made the right decision. Also, do not try to investigate Gu Jun’s identity. Do you understand?”\n\n“OK, Grandfather.”",

            "content": "Antarctica\n\nLongyun and Code B were still fighting the underwater monster.\n\nMore and more sword slashes and stabs flowed through the water, accompanied by the monster's occasional attacks. This once peaceful underwater place was now filled with violence and murderous intent.\n\nIt was now increasingly clear that defeating the monster completely was impossible, especially since it had become far more mobile than before.\n\nLongyun’s innate weapon kept breathing fire, but the results were underwhelming. There were some scars on the monster, but none of them were life-threatening.\n\nLongyun realized that the monster still suffered from a lack of intellect, as though something was constantly suppressing its mind. Otherwise, it would have been unstoppable by now.\n\nLongyun tried the previous tactic again, each of them attacking from opposite sides, but the effect was minimal.\n\nHe also began to notice that Code B was growing weaker, despite taking top-level pills. After all, it was an energy-consuming battle.\n\nLongyun now understood that they wouldn't be able to defeat the monster without using that ultimate move. Fortunately, they now knew the creature’s weakness.\n\nThinking of this, Longyun felt a pang of sorrow. Code B had been his companion for a long time. But the mission was more important.\n\nThen Longyun looked at Code B and began to communicate through divine sense. Hearing the command, Code B’s eyes turned cold and resolute.\n\nHe gathered all his remaining strength for the final push.\n\nLongyun then took out nearly all his attacking tools and weapons, like his rod, and threw them toward Code B. After that, pain spread across his face. He was about to extract his innate core, an excruciatingly painful process. After some time, his face was full of fatigue, his eyes lost their luster, and it could be seen that he had become a lot weaker. And then a golden bead, glowing as brightly as the sun, appeared in Longyun’s hand. He gazed at it with a hint of nostalgia. He hadn’t wanted to take this step, but the array piece was too important.\n\nOnce everything was ready, Code B launched himself at the monster.\n\nIn his hands were all the tools, both his own and Longyun’s. As soon as the monster saw Code B rushing toward it, it instantly opened its massive jaws. Code B dove directly into its mouth. Just before it could close, Longyun threw his innate core. It followed Code B into the monster's mouth, just a moment behind him.\n\nThe monster shut its jaws, visibly satisfied. It then looked at Longyun with a provocative gaze, ready to digest Code B.\n\nInside its mostly transparent belly, Code B was now surrounded by the monster’s digestive fluids. Slowly, he swam toward the inner area, toward the monster’s weakness. Though he didn’t show it, Longyun knew he must be in immense pain; this creature’s digestive fluid was no joke.\n\nIts weakness… yes, that heart-like organ that pulsed and contracted rhythmically. Code B was almost there. Longyun watched the scene with unwavering focus.\n\nJust as Code B reached the target, he paused.\n\nLongyun immediately became alert. He activated all his defensive mechanisms and, taking advantage of the moment, retrieved the array piece into his space ring.\n\nAfter a brief pause, Code B’s face filled with determination and fanaticism. He then opened his eyes wide and looked around, as if it were the last time he’d see the world.\n\nAfter that, he muttered something. Though Longyun couldn’t hear the words, he understood them:\n\n“Humanity shall prevail. The Gu Empire will live forever.”\n\nThen Code B ignited his weapon.\n\nAt the same moment, Longyun snapped his fingers, signaling his innate core to activate.\n\nThen… Bang.\n\nA massive explosion followed.\n\nIt was as if the earth itself had collapsed.\n\nThe blast was so powerful that neither the underwater array nor the monster’s incredibly durable innate body could withstand it.\n\nNearly everything within a one cubic kilometer radius was obliterated. Water and ice were vaporized in an instant.\n\nEven with Longyun’s powerful defensive tools and his formidable innate body, he couldn’t fully protect himself. The shockwave left him nearly unconscious.\n\nThough he was an innate-level warrior, he had lost his core, and the force unleashed in the explosion was extraordinary. Several powerful tools and the innate core had been used simultaneously.\n\nAnd so, it happened. He was now completely crushed.\n\nOn the icy surface, Code Z sensed everything.\n\nThen he saw the huge mushroom cloud in the sky. Although he was not harmed severely, he was visibly shaken.\n\nFor a long time, he had received no information from either Longyun or Code B. Now, since the influence of he underwater array was gone, he could sense Longyun, but not Code B.\n\nEnsure your favorite authors get the support they deserve. Read this novel on Royal Road.\n\nLocking onto Longyun’s aura with his divine sense, he moved swiftly through the ruined underwater landscape to reach him.\n\nLongyun was nearly unconscious.\n\nHe picked up Longyun and began searching for the array piece.\n\nLongyun, through divine sense, told him that the array piece was in the space ring. Just after conveying this, he lost consciousness completely.\n\nCode Z quickly checked on him. Although Longyun’s condition was critical, it wasn’t life-threatening.\n\nWith no time to waste, Code Z lifted Longyun and made his way to the surface, then started running through the ice.\n\nThough Antarctica was a barren continent, it held immense resources beneath the ice, so inevitably, various countries maintained a military presence.\n\nAfter running nearly five kilometers, Code Z suddenly sensed a disturbance in the air. Being highly experienced, he immediately recognized it; it was Eagletron, one of the most advanced fighter planes from Country B, capable of vertical landing.\n\nCode Z knew all too well that several military camps from different nations were stationed nearby. It was impossible to conceal the explosion from them; they had detected it and were now moving in to investigate.\n\nHe had to move fast and do it while carrying Longyun.\n\nAfter running for a while longer, he finally spotted the aircraft approaching. As it neared him, it began hovering overhead, scanning him carefully.\n\nThen, it descended and landed on the ice.\n\nAfter some time, four soldiers stepped out of the plane.\n\nThe pilot remained in the cockpit, and Code Z knew very well that the pilot’s finger was likely resting on the trigger of the plane’s weapon system.\n\nThey had to be cautious; they knew that Code Z was no ordinary person. Truth be told, under normal circumstances, Code Z wouldn’t have feared this plane. But now, things were different. He was carrying Longyun and protecting the mission.\n\nThe four soldiers surrounded him and demanded his identity.\n\nCode Z calmly replied that he was from Country X and served in the military.\n\nOne of them stepped forward and said, “Show us your ID.”\n\nIn response, Code Z asked coldly, “Why should I show you? Who are you?”\n\nOriginally, Code Z had planned to get some help from these men. There would be complications, of course, but he believed he could handle them, even eliminate them, if necessary. But now, something had changed.\n\nHe felt a presence.\n\nThe soldiers were also stunned. They did not understand why this person suddenly became so aggressive.\n\nJust as the soldiers were about to show a dominating attitude and prepared to threaten to use force, a sword sliced out from the white, snowy world.\n\nFour strikes.\n\nFour heads flew.\n\nFour soldiers dropped dead.\n\nIt was a bloody scene. Crimson stained the pristine white ice, and the four severed heads rolled like grotesque blossoms, four vivid red flowers blooming on the frozen ground.\n\nThe attack was so sudden that there was still calmness in the soldiers’ eyes. Even in death, they had not seen it coming.\n\nClean. Ruthless. Silent.\n\nExactly what one would expect from the Empire’s Dark Guards.\n\nCode Z now realized he should have anticipated this. Of course, the Dark Guards would trail them. This was a mission of critical importance, and an elder was directly involved. Moreover, the Dark Guards were notorious for being nosy; they were expected to follow missions like this, even from the shadows.\n\nFrom the cockpit, the fighter pilot saw everything unfold. He immediately realized the danger. Panicked, he tried to lift the aircraft back into the air, and almost succeeded.\n\nBut then, another flash of sword light—\n\nThis sword strike was unusual, not aimed at the plane itself, but at the pilot. It was a mental sword strike, soft and precise. It slipped effortlessly into the cockpit like magic, bypassing the exterior without damaging the plane’s structure.\n\nThe pilot died instantly.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t enough to stop the aircraft. This type of fighter had a powerful autopilot system that would automatically follow its pre-set flight path in such emergencies. So it flew away fast before the dark guards got the chance to take any more action to stop it.\n\nThen, five figures emerged from the void like a tornado of wind.\n\nThey were the attackers, the Dark Guards of the Gu Empire. Each of them was at the HuaJin level, clad in the standard uniform of their order.\n\nCode Z asked them, “How many of you are here?”\n\n“You don’t need to know,” one replied coldly. “What you do need to know is, we’ve already sent someone to retrieve the item from the blast site. Also, stay alert. The danger isn't over.”\n\nJust as he finished speaking, seven more figures appeared on the horizon.\n\nCode Z turned his gaze and immediately recognized them, not ordinary soldiers, but Werewolves from the Werewolf Association. They, too, had a powerful military presence on the continent, and it was near the blast site.\n\nTruly, human greed knows no bounds; everyone wants to get a piece of this frozen continent.\n\nTruth be told, Code Z didn’t want to fight them. Why?\n\nBecause the Empire had been attempting to bring the Werewolves under its control for years, and recently, some progress had been made. These particular Werewolves might one day become valuable warriors for the Empire. They were an integral part of the Empire’s long-term strategic development plan.\n\nAfter all, they were one of the two dominant forces of continent E and had powerful influence in the order of thirty-three.\n\nThe other?\n\nThe Vampires, of course.\n\nAs Code Z pondered this, the Werewolves reached the scene. True to their impulsive nature, they took one look at the severed heads on the ice and immediately launched an attack without any notice or conversation.\n\nCode Z wanted to stop them.\n\nBut then he let out a long sigh.\n\nWhatever.\n\nFrom the insignias on their uniforms, emblazoned on their towering three-meter-tall wolf-headed hairy bodies, it was clear: these Werewolves weren’t from any tribe currently aligned with the Gu Empire.\n\nIf they wanted to die, so be it.\n\nThey were just too hot-headed.",

            "content": "Soon, the Werewolves reached them.\nThey weren't speaking English, but some other language.\nThen, they attacked.\n\nThey did not use any weapon; to them, their bodies were their best weapon. When they became enraged, they grew to almost four meters tall.\n\nAnd then?\n\nAnother slaughter.\n\nAlthough the Werewolves were greater in both number and size, they were ultimately only at the equivalent of the Dark Realm. So the inevitable happened.\n\nThey didn’t stand much of a chance.\n\nCode Z understood this was due to their overconfidence and hotheaded nature.\n\nHe looked at these werewolves and thought, these bloody things, these foolish things, when will they be able to control their temper? Actually, they never learn. For these kinds of hotheadedness, they are always suppressed by the vampires.\n\nFrom start to finish, they did not utter a word to them, nor did they ask anything, which only made the dark guards more enraged.\n\nSince you people are so idiotic, die happily.\n\nBut then something else happened that left Code Z stunned. He instantly snapped out of his light mode.\n\nFrom the sky, several small missiles dropped.\n\nIt was so sudden, and so silent, that even the Dark Guards were caught off guard. Their focus had been entirely on fighting the Werewolves. As a result, tragedy struck, and almost all of them were injured to some degree.\n\nOne of them was badly wounded in the leg; he was clenching his jaw strongly, trying not to let any painful sound come out of his mouth.\n\nThen, from the far sky, two military helicopters came into view. These two helicopters were the culprits who threw the missile.\n\nCode Z recognized the machines immediately, and their information came into his mind; they were from Country M: H3 helicopters, some of the deadliest military helicopters in the world. Especially designed for operations in extreme weather, they were perfectly suited to Antarctica.\n\nThese machines were the prized possessions of Country M’s military. They were export-banned; only Country M's forces were authorized to use them.\n\nAs soon as the choppers approached, bullets started flying.\n\nThese weren’t ordinary bullets; they were specially coated with uranium, making them dangerous even for HuaJin-level cultivators.\n\nIt was clear: Country M suspected that the explosion was related to cultivators, and that they might have recovered some valuable treasure from Antarctica. Unlike the team from Country B, they had come far more prepared.\n\nFollowing the bullet barrage, a powerful projectile was launched, also designed specifically for cultivators. It exploded into uranium-coated splinters upon impact.\n\nCode Z understood that these machines were using a super AI, although the dark guards were moving and evading the bullets with super-fast speed, the muzzles of the guns were always following them. These guns must use an excellent prediction algorithm.\n\nFrom the looks of it, Country M had made their decision:\n\nKill first. Ask later.\n\nAfter understanding this, the looks in the dark guard members' eyes became colder and more ruthless.\n\nWith the gunfire continuing, the members of the Gu Empire somehow managed to survive,\nBut all the remaining werewolves were killed.\n\nCode Z looked at the Country M military personnel and their helicopters and let out a bitter smile.\n\nAs expected of Country M, they’re always so arrogant. No questions asked. Just fire.\n\nDue to the ongoing barrage and the evasive maneuvers by the Dark Guards and Code Z, several massive holes had formed in the ice, revealing the frigid waters beneath.\n\nTo survive the bullets and rockets, some of the Dark Guards dove into the water.\n\nThis situation was even worse than when they had been attacked by the fighter jet from Country B. These helicopters were far more dangerous in close combat.\n\nCode Z didn’t jump into the water. Why?\n\nBecause of Longyun.\nHe was already badly injured, and plunging into sub-zero temperature water would only make things worse, so jumping into the water would be the last resort.\n\nSuddenly, a Dark Guard burst out of the water like a bullet.\nHe leapt high into the sky and, in an instant, reached the helicopter hovering nearly sixty meters above the ground.\n\nAs he closed in, he unleashed a deadly sword strike at the helicopter's rotors.\n\nCode Z glanced up. He recognized him; it was likely the leader of the Dark Guards.\n\nThe sword light struck the base of the rotors with surgical precision, shattering them instantly.\n\nThe rotors, still spinning, flew off and crashed violently onto the ice.\n\nMoments later, the helicopter itself seemed to realize its fate and followed suit, plummeting from the sky and slamming into the ground with a devastating explosion.\n\nThe blast fractured the ice, and freezing water spilled out in waves.\n\nThe Dark Guard who had attacked remained hovering mid-air, eyes scanning the sky for another opportunity to strike.\nBut the remaining helicopter had ascended, climbing higher, nearly two hundred meters, and no opening was left.\n\nCode Z watched the wreckage below and couldn’t help but admit—\n\nIt was an exceptional attack.\nEven for him, executing something like that would have been extremely difficult.\n\nClearly, the Empire had dispatched some of its finest Dark Guards.\n\nNow, the other helicopter had grown more cautious.\nIt kept its distance and only launched occasional attacks from afar.\n\nThey had reached a stalemate.\n\nThis tale has been unlawfully lifted without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.\n\nAn impasse.\n\nCode Z assessed the situation and turned to the Dark Guard leader, who had just landed nearby.\n\n“Shouldn’t there be a Country X base here? From what I see, it looks like this copter has contacted its base and is waiting for reinforcements. Maybe you should consider using that mental strike again.”\n\nThe Dark Guard leader responded calmly,\n“There are two Country X bases on this continent, but they’re a bit far from here. We didn’t inform them; this mission was top-secret from the start, so we never expected any assistance. That said, they might already know something’s going on. But don’t worry. We have a Dark Guard base hidden beneath the ice, and reinforcements are on their way. As for the mental strike… it consumes too much energy.\n\nWe could escape if we wanted to, but I’m staying. These soldiers attacked without warning, without asking a single question. We have to teach them a lesson. Bringing down both copters isn’t just about survival, it’s about the prestige of the Dark Guard.”\n\n“Hmm,” Code Z muttered in agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, skirmishes between the remaining helicopter and the Dark Guards continued.\n\nOccasionally, the helicopter fired bullets and missiles. In response, streaks of sword light sliced through the sky from the Dark Guards.\n\nSince the initial ambush, one Dark Guard had been badly injured. The others had only suffered minor wounds.\n\nThe severely injured guard remained underwater. Surfacing was too dangerous; his slowed movements could get him caught in the line of fire.\n\nCode Z studied the scene and said with a frown,\n“We should end this quickly. Other parties may arrive soon. It’s best if we leave.”\n\nThe Dark Guard leader gave a faint smile.\n\n“Don’t worry. Our reinforcements have already arrived.”\n\nJust as he finished speaking, a blinding beam of light streaked across the sky from afar and struck the helicopter directly. It moved so fast that even the highly advanced copter didn’t have a chance to evade.\n\nFrom the glow and the force behind it, Code Z could tell that it was a powerful spiritual tool, possibly semi-innate, or even at the innate level.\n\nThis was likely the strongest weapon the Dark Guards possessed at their Antarctic base.\n\nThe blast tore a massive hole through the center of the helicopter.\n\nThen came the explosion, loud, fiery, and final.\n\nThe entire unit was wiped out.\n\nAfter some time, the battlefield quieted.\n\nThe situation was finally stabilized.\n\nAnd then, Code Z saw the weapon that had struck the copter.\n\nIt was a silver spear, now floating motionlessly in the sky.\n\nAfter a few moments, a man appeared.\nHe wasn’t running, just walking. But with every step he took, he covered nearly ten meters of distance, closing in swiftly and calmly.\n\nHe raised his hand toward the sky, and the spear flew directly into his grasp.\n\nWalking over to Code Z, he asked,\n“What’s the elder’s current condition?”\n\n“He’s very weak, but not in a life-threatening state.”\n\n“Good. Let’s go. We’ve retrieved everything important from the blast site. We also found the remains of Code B. He’s dead, obviously.”\n\n“Yes, I knew.”\n\n“Hmm.”\n\nIt was deep into the night.\nGu Jun was asleep.\n\nBut then, something strange happened.\nHe began to toss and turn in his sleep, his face twitching, his breath uneven.\n\nFrom the outside, it looked like physical discomfort. But inside, he was dreaming, or perhaps, experiencing something more.\n\nIn his dream, he saw a platform.\n\nBut it wasn’t a normal platform. It was massive, so vast that he couldn’t see where it began or where it ended. The space felt surreal, almost maze-like, distorting all sense of scale.\n\nAnd on that endless platform, he saw a person, although he could not see clearly; it should be a woman.\n\nShe was bound by hundreds of thousands of tiny chains, each forged from a strange, unknown material. The chains shifted constantly, sometimes tightening, sometimes twisting, and always moving.\n\nEverything about them screamed restraint and containment.\n\nOn her head sat a black, blood-soaked crown. Her entire body was drenched in blood, and Gu Jun could see that the chains were absorbing it, feeding on it.\n\nThe blood seemed to power the chains, fueling their ability to hold her down.\n\nEven though she was wounded and restrained, her aura was overwhelming.\n\nGu Jun didn’t know how strong she was, but he instinctively knew:\nThis was the most powerful person he had ever seen.\n\nShe stood motionless, her head bowed, eyes hidden beneath shadow.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, she raised her head.\n\nAnd looked directly at him.\n\nGu Jun froze.\n\nIn that instant, he made eye contact.\n\nAnd something ancient, terrifying, and unfathomably deep stared back at him.\n\nHe was stunned, paralyzed in the dream world.\n\nWhat kind of eyes were those?\n\nThey were cold, yet loving.\nRuthless, yet benevolent.\nA paradox of emotions, shifting in every blink.\n\nGu Jun understood instantly—\nThis was the supreme mindset, supreme dao heart.\nOne thought to Buddha, one thought to the Devil.\n\nThen the woman smiled, a strange, haunting smile.\nEven though it was a dream, Gu Jun felt it in every fiber of his being.\nHis flesh went numb. His bones turned cold. He couldn’t move.\n\nThen the woman spoke—\n“Hehe… Tell me, boy. What is an Emperor?”\n\nThere was a sudden jolt.\nGu Jun snapped awake, his body drenched in sweat.\n\nHis heart pounded.\nHis eyes darted around.\n\nHe sat up, took a long breath, and muttered,\n“That dream again…”\n\nAfter some moments, he stood, walked out of the house, and crossed the empty street.\nThere, under the dark sky, he sat on a cold park bench, alone.\n\nA strange sight, indeed:\nA man, alone, on a bench, at this hour of night.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Gu Jun spoke:\n“What happened?”\n\nA respectful voice answered from the shadows.\n“Your Highness, we received a report from Antarctica.”\n\n“Tell me everything.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nAnd then Gu Jun listened, quiet and still, as every detail of the Antarctic incident was relayed.\n\nWhen it was over, he asked,\n“When will they arrive?”\n\n“Tomorrow night. About 18 hours from now.”\n\n“Alright. I’ll go. You may leave.”\n\n“Your Highness…”\n\n“I know. You go.”\n\n“Farewell, Your Highness.”\n\nThen that person vanished.\nDisappeared into thin air without a sound.\n\nThat was Longwei, the messenger.\n\nGu Jun sat still, then slowly turned his gaze toward the far end of the park, into the dense shadows among the bushes.\n\nHe had known for a while…\nTwo people were hiding there.\n\nHe didn’t know when they’d arrived, but it didn’t matter.\nThey were assassins.\nNot top-tier, but still competent, likely at the level of Bright Strength.\n\nGu Jun didn’t know who had sent them.\nIt could have been the Wang family,\nOr the Xiao family,\nOr even Ning Zhe himself.\n\nAll three had their hands in the Bai Yue affair, so all three had a reason to see him dead.\n\nHe had sensed them since last night, when they began tailing him through the streets.\nThey didn’t strike then, probably due to a lack of opportunity.\n\nBut now…\n\nAfter that dream,\nAfter the troubling report from Antarctica,\nGu Jun’s mind was weighed down, with frustration, unease, and the sting of loss.\n\nAn elder had been gravely injured. That alone was a heavy blow.\n\nSo now, he was offering them a chance.\n\nA chance…\nTo kill him.",

            "content": "Gu Jun slowly stood up.\n\nHe walked deeper into the park.\n\nIt was a community park attached to his residence, so it remained open at night.\n\nTwo assassins looked at him with mild surprise, as if wondering why someone would be strolling here at such an hour. Then, they smiled.\n\nWow, what a great opportunity. It’s true, when death calls, you subconsciously walk toward it.\n\nGu Jun smiled as well. He glanced at the two assassins. One was older, around forty, with a mustache. The other was younger, likely in his thirties, and his cultivation level was noticeably lower.\n\nAs Gu Jun continued walking deeper into the park, the two assassins silently followed him.\n\nGu Jun didn’t bother hiding his footsteps. As he walked, the crisp sound of dry leaves being crushed underfoot echoed softly in the still night air.\n\nThen, suddenly, when he passed beneath the shadow of a tree, he vanished.\n\nSome time later, the two assassins reached the spot where Gu Jun had disappeared.\n\nThey exchanged puzzled glances, then resumed searching the area.\n\nAs they looked around, a stone suddenly came flying out of nowhere and struck the younger assassin in the knee.\n\nHe stumbled and collapsed to the ground.\n\nThe older one turned toward him. “What happened? Why are you falling on your own?”\n\n“I thought something hit me.”\n\n“Nothing hit you. You just tripped over a tree root. You can’t even avoid that? Your quality is too low.”\n\nJust as he finished speaking, another stone flew through the air, this time striking the older assassin.\n\nUnlike his companion, the older one had far more experience. The moment the stone hit him, his instincts kicked in. He immediately became alert.\n\nHe scanned the surroundings carefully.\n\nHe recalled the information about the target; it was just a student from the countryside, supposedly with no combat experience. Someone like that shouldn't pose any threat.\n\nThen who was throwing the stones?\n\nAs the two assassins moved forward again to search for Gu Jun, a slender tree branch suddenly flew in from a short distance. Its sharpened tip pierced the younger assassin’s leg, passing clean through. He dropped to the ground with a cry.\n\nBefore he could react, another stone came flying, this one much smaller. It struck his forehead with precision.\n\nHe didn’t even realize what had hit him before he died. A small, round hole appeared at the center of his forehead.\n\nThe older assassin immediately understood everything had gone wrong.\n\nThe target clearly wasn’t some ordinary student. He was a warrior. He might even have a cultivation level higher than his own.\n\nWasting no time, the older assassin stopped trying to investigate. There was no point looking, no point asking questions.\n\nHe turned and ran.\n\nBut before he could get far, a leg stretched out from the shadows.\n\nHe tripped over it and fell hard to the ground.\n\nThe leg, of course, belonged to Gu Jun.\n\nHe now stood over the assassin, gazing down at him with indifferent eyes.\n\nThen he asked coldly, “So, tell me, who sent you?”\n\n“Who are you? Your profile said you were just a normal person. But you clearly have high cultivation!”\n\n“You don’t need to know. To be honest, you’re going to die today, that much is certain. But you should be happy. Normally, someone like you wouldn’t have the honor of dying by my hand. But today, I’m in a bad mood.”\n\n“I don’t know who wants you dead! I just accepted the mission from a site online. Please, let me go!”\n\nThe moment he finished speaking, a thin branch shot out and stabbed into the soft part of his neck.\n\nThe truth was, Gu Jun didn’t really care who sent them. He could find out easily enough if he truly wanted to.\n\nHe looked at the bloody corpses of the two assassins.\n\nIt was true that he hadn’t killed many people in real life. But he had bathed in blood countless times within the virtual world of the training device. And that device, an extraordinary treasure, made everything feel terrifyingly real. In that world, he had become numb to killing.\n\nJust to be sure, he pulled the branch from the assassin’s neck and examined his own reaction.\n\nHe waited to see if there was any discomfort… any guilt.\n\nNope, Nothing.\n\nThose assassins had assumed he possessed a higher cultivation level than them. But that wasn’t the case. He was only at the Vitality Sensation level. However, thanks to his top-tier training and relentless effort, he could easily deal with them; he could see the flaws in their techniques and methods.\n\nAnd with their mediocre cultivation methods, he could have taken them on even if they were at the Peak Bright Strength level, though it wouldn’t have been as easy as it was now.\n\nIf you spot this story on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\n\nHe then slowly left the park and headed back to his house.\n\nHe needed to get some sleep; tomorrow was the first day of university life.\n\nMorning.\n\nGu Jun woke up and went to the university.\n\nAs soon as he arrived, he noticed many luxurious cars, driven by both male and female students.\n\nGu Jun had come on a bicycle, making him stand out awkwardly among all those flashy vehicles.\n\nSome students even looked at him with contempt.\n\nEven walking was better than this; after all, this was Tianhai Royal University.\n\nHuh. Materialistic society, he thought.\n\nHe left the parking area and entered his dormitory. All of his roommates were already there, getting ready for their first day.\n\nAs soon as he entered, nearly all of them looked at him with admiration. Especially Xiao Wei, he gazed at Gu Jun with worshipful eyes.\n\n“Boss, you're on fire! You made Bai Yue your girlfriend yesterday, and you didn’t come back to the dorm last night. Where were you? Off getting some night action with the cold queen?”\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” Gu Jun replied. “I was at my house, the one my family arranged for me.”\n\n“Ohh, so you were at your house… with Bai Yue, right?”\n\nGu Jun lightly smacked Xiao Wei’s head. “No, I was alone.”\n\n“Alone with Bai Yue, right?”\n\n“No. I was completely alone.”\n\n“Really? That’s hard to believe.”\n\nXiao Wei gave him a suspicious look.\n\n“You’ll have to believe it, whether you want to or not. Now let’s go to the cafeteria. I’m starving.”\n\nAs soon as they stepped outside, they ran into Luo Yuxin, who had clearly been waiting for them.\n\nThe group then made their way to Cafeteria No. 1.\n\nAfter everyone sat down, Luo Yuxin took the lead in ordering food, as she was the most familiar with the cafeteria's menu.\n\nGu Jun glanced between her and Zhao Ming, curiosity in his eyes.\n“So... what’s your relationship? You two must have some history.”\n\nXiao Wei smirked and chimed in, “Yeah, tell him. We all know already, he’s the only one who doesn’t.”\n\nZhao Ming looked a little embarrassed. “We were childhood playmates. My mom was her nanny when she was little. Then we went to school together, learned piano together… During college, we started dating. When her family found out, they—”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Gu Jun interrupted, waving his hand. “Sounds like a typical dog-blood love drama. So, you came to this university for her?”\n\n“She’s definitely one of the reasons,” Zhao Ming admitted.\n\nAt last, Luo Yuxin turned to Gu Jun and said politely, “Sorry for the late introduction. I’m Luo Yuxin, Zhao Ming’s girlfriend.”\n\nGu Jun gave Zhao Ming a slight smile. Yesterday, this guy was checking out the girls on the top ten list. Maybe he wasn’t sure about her before.\n\nLuo Yuxin, on the other hand, was quietly observing all of Zhao Ming’s roommates.\nShe hadn’t forgotten the events of the previous night.\nShe knew none of these boys were simple.\n\nShe spoke sincerely, “Thank you all for what you did last night. If you weren’t there, I don’t know what would’ve happened to me.”\n\nXiao Wei waved it off. “Forget it. That wasn’t just about you; it was a complicated situation. Anyway, now you’re our sister-in-law. Of course, we’ll protect you.”\n\nZhou Hao nodded in agreement. “Mhm.”\n\nGu Jun then turned to Zhou Hao and remarked, “You had a good fight yesterday. Looked like you were in rough shape… but today, you’ve recovered well.”\n\nZhou Hao’s expression turned slightly bitter.\nHe had paid a heavy price for that recovery.\n\nGu Jun could guess—Zhou Hao had clearly used a powerful and expensive healing pill. Without it, recovering so quickly from that kind of injury would’ve been impossible.\n\nGu Jun took a deep breath, subtly trying to catch the lingering scent…\nMaybe he could identify the origin of the pill.\n\nAnd just as he suspected, he caught the scent.\nThat pill had come from the Medicine God Sect.\n\nThey continued eating and laughing. The atmosphere was light and harmonious.\n\nBut it didn’t last.\n\nSuddenly, heavy footsteps echoed behind Gu Jun.\nA tall, imposing figure approached their table.\nHe stared at them for a moment, then spoke loudly:\n\n“Who here is Gu Jun? Come to the Martial Arts Club right now. Our boss wants to see you.”\n\nHe didn’t even get to finish his sentence before he was sent flying backward.\n\nHe crashed onto the floor with a heavy thud and let out a gasp of pain.\n\nThe strike had been brutal.\n\nThe one who moved was Xiao Wei.\n\nHe stood up slowly, walked over to the man now groaning on the ground, and delivered another swift, stylish kick.\n\n“Idiot,” Xiao Wei sneered. “With that weak strength, you dare walk up to someone from Dormitory 3? Haven’t you heard? Dormitory 3 is ominous. And you dare ruin our good mood?”\n\nHe leaned closer and added, “Go back to wherever you came from and tell your fucking boss, next time, come himself. Hitting a minion like you doesn’t feel satisfying.”\n\nWith a dramatic flick of his hair, he turned around and strolled back to his seat.\n\nAlmost every girl nearby looked at him with starstruck eyes.\n\nAfter finishing their meal, the group left the cafeteria and made their way to the grand auditorium.\n\nIt was time for the university’s inauguration ceremony.\n\nThe event itself was dull. Speeches, introductions, formalities, nothing worth remembering.\n\nThe only highlight was the appearance of Bai Yue.\n\nShe stood out like a breeze of cool wind in a blazing summer, calm, elegant, refreshing.\nMany boys and even girls watched her with admiration in their eyes.\n\nIt had only been a day since the incident, so not many people were aware of it yet. But Gu Jun knew, once word spread, the pressure on him would multiply several times over.\n\nThe cafeteria incident today… was just the appetizer.\n\nThinking of all this, Gu Jun made a soft clicking sound with his tongue.",

            "content": "After the inauguration ceremony, there was nothing particularly exciting.\n\nThere were no classes today, as it was the first day of university.\n\nTruth be told, Gu Jun wanted to visit the Martial Arts Club, but then he remembered, tonight, he had to visit the elder.\n\nSo, after some time, Gu Jun returned to his house.\n\nEvening.\n\nA three-car convoy sped through a quiet road.\n\nAfter a while, it reached a small hill.\n\nPeople stepped out of the cars.\n\nLi Ming exited first and opened the door of the middle car.\n\nGu Jun stepped out.\n\nAs they arrived at the hilltop, a door appeared out of thin air, formed from the void itself.\n\nGu Jun and the others walked through it.\n\nThe moment they entered, the door vanished behind them.\n\nThey now stood at the beginning of a long hallway.\n\nThey proceeded forward and soon reached its center.\n\nOnly two people were present, the Left Protector and the Right Protector.\n\nBoth protectors bowed and spoke in unison,\n“Greetings, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun nodded.\n“How is everyone doing?”\n\n“Thank you for asking. Everyone is well. The First Elder has entered seclusion. We expect him to break through to the peak of the Innate level very soon.”\n\n“Good. Let’s go see the Tenth Elder.”\n\nThe group continued down a series of maze-like hallways.\n\nEventually, they arrived at a room that resembled a high-end hospital suite.\n\nGu Jun entered alone.\n\nThe others remained standing outside.\n\nInside the suite, two people were present.\nOne of them lay unconscious on the bed, the Tenth Elder.\n\nGu Jun now stood by the bedside, looking at the Tenth Elder, Longyun, with quiet sorrow. It was a significant loss.\n\nHe stepped closer and placed his right hand gently on Longyun’s forehead.\n\nAfter a few moments, he turned his gaze to another person in the room.\n\nThis man resembled a kind uncle, not particularly remarkable in appearance. If anything stood out, it was his gentle expression and the numerous scars across his hands, hinting at frequent work with fire.\n\nBut to someone knowledgeable, there was something more telling: the distinct scent of medicine that lingered around him.\n\nThis was Longfeng, the Fourth Elder, and the head of the Medical and Alchemy Division of the Gu Empire.\n\nGu Jun asked,\n“What’s his condition?”\n\nLongfeng replied solemnly,\n“Not good. He’s lost his Innate Core. He will survive, but under normal circumstances, it will take around thirty years to recover his strength. If we can find any rare heavenly or earthly treasures with healing properties, we may be able to shorten that time considerably.”\n\n“For now, use whatever resources we have in our inventory,” Gu Jun ordered.\n\n“Yes, Your Highness,” Longfeng responded respectfully.\n\nGu Jun stood and began walking away, with the Fourth Elder silently following.\n\nAfter a while, they arrived at a massive meeting room, roughly five hundred square meters in size. At its center stood a large, egg-shaped table surrounded by numerous chairs.\n\nSeveral people were already present, standing respectfully beside their seats.\n\nGu Jun walked over and sat in the central chair, the seat of command.\n\nToday was a significant occasion.\n\nWhy?\nBecause almost all the important officials of the Gu Empire were gathered here.\n\nOnce Gu Jun was seated, he gave a slight nod. The others followed his signal and sat down as well.\n\nHe took out a cigarette, his imperial cigarette, and lit it.\n\nAs always, the moment he took a drag, a subtle shift occurred in him. His demeanor hardened, and a wave of imperial authority radiated outward.\n\nHe didn’t speak for a long while.\n\nHe smoked in silence.\n\nThen, slowly, Gu Jun raised his gaze.\n\nOn Gu Jun’s right sat the Right Protector, and on his left sat the Left Protector.\n\nThe Great Elder was seated directly across from him, facing Gu Jun from the opposite side of the table.\n\nThis novel's true home is a different platform. Support the author by finding it there.\n\nGu Jun spoke slowly,\n“Begin the completion of the Heaven-Encompassing Array immediately.”\n\nThe Great Elder nodded and replied,\n“Acknowledged, Your Highness. We now have everything needed to complete the array.”\n\n“Also…”\n\nThe moment Gu Jun uttered the word, a sharp wave of killing intent and dominance surged from him.\n\nSeeing this, everyone present instinctively straightened, their expressions growing solemn.\n\n“In Antarctica,” Gu Jun continued, “destroy the bases of Country M and Country B that attacked us. Also, eliminate the werewolf base.\n\nAs for Country M and the werewolves, leave nothing behind. Erase both life and equipment. For Country B, destroy only the equipment.”\n\nThe entire room fell silent.\n\nThen, all eyes turned to Gu Jun, their gazes filled with respect.\n\nThe Right Protector responded,\n“Order received, Your Highness.”\n\nThen the Left Protector stepped forward and handed Gu Jun a document. It wasn’t very thick, only about ten pages.\n\nGu Jun took the file and began reading.\n\nAt first, his expression was indifferent.\n\nBut by the time he reached the final page, a faint flicker of emotion crossed his face.\n\n“So, the Ning family is involved…” he muttered.\n“Fine. Help him. First, get him out. After that, we’ll decide how to use him.”\n\n“Understood, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun then stood.\n“The meeting is over.”\n\nEveryone rose to their feet.\n\n“Farewell, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun turned and began walking away.\n\nOnly the Left Protector followed him.\n\nAfter a brief walk through the vast corridor, Gu Jun stepped into another massive room.\n\nInside the room stood a massive crate, five meters on each side. It was clearly a magic tool, and one of innate-level quality.\n\nSomething was moving inside it.\n\nGu Jun observed it for a moment, then asked the Left Protector,\n“Have you identified it?”\n\n“No, Your Highness,” the Left Protector replied.\n“We couldn’t fully identify it. Judging by its appearance, it’s definitely some kind of bird. It was at the late stage of the Innate level when it fought with the Tenth Elder. What’s truly remarkable is that even after such a powerful explosion inside it, it didn’t die.\n\nIn fact, it began to heal. Though its strength dropped to the semi-innate level, it’s recovering rapidly. At this rate, it’ll be fully healed soon. Its regenerative speed is astonishing.”\n\nGu Jun gave a low hum.\n“Open it.”\n\nThe Left Protector signaled with his hand, and the crate slowly opened.\n\nGu Jun focused his attention.\n\nIt was a bird.\n\nA strikingly beautiful bird.\n\nNow standing nearly two meters tall, with a wingspan of about 2.4 meters, it radiated a quiet strength.\n\nIts feathers were an enchanting ice-blue, and its eyes glowed like polished rubies.\n\nGu Jun could barely believe this majestic creature was the same ugly, tattered thing he had seen in the footage of its battle with the Tenth Elder and Code B.\n\nAs the crate fully opened, the bird rose to its feet. Gu Jun noticed, with some surprise, that there was no hostility in its eyes or behavior.\n\nWhen the bird opened its eyes, it immediately looked at the Left Protector with clear fear.\n\nIt could sense the threat.\n\nThe fear was justified. Even at its peak, the creature was like a child before the power of the Left Protector.\n\nThen its gaze shifted to Gu Jun.\n\nIt stared at him, silent, steady, for nearly thirty seconds.\n\nAt the end of that long gaze, Gu Jun sensed something unusual.\n\nThere was a trace of solicitation in its eyes… as if it wanted to communicate.\n\nAnd then, just as he was about to speak—\n\nA voice echoed softly in Gu Jun’s ears.\n\nIt was the voice of Xuanzhi.\n\n“It’s a variant of the Ice Phoenix,” Xuanzhi’s voice continued.\n“Its bloodline is noble, and there’s a good chance it could eventually evolve into a true Ice Phoenix. It’s incredibly old.\n\nOnce, these creatures were numerous across the Milky Way Galaxy, but after the last Great War, their numbers dwindled dramatically. They’re a peaceful species by nature and rarely interact with other beings or races.\n\nThe fact that it was found at the array piece site means someone used it, tainted it with corrupt elements, and forced it into violent behavior. It was a trap.\n\nIts blood possesses powerful healing properties. Until you find a better method, you can use its blood to treat the Tenth Elder.\n\nAlso, humans can form contracts with this kind of creature. However, this species is traditionally more compatible with women as contract partners. In any case, we’ll need some special items to complete the contract ritual.”\n\n“Understood,” Gu Jun replied.\n\nHe then turned to the Left Protector.\n“I’ll be taking it with me.”\n\n“Acknowledged, Your Highness.”\n\nGu Jun left the room and entered the next chamber.\n\nIt was where the array piece had been stored.\n\nHe stood still, observing the artifact from a distance, not stepping too close.\n\nThen, just as he was about to ask the Left Protector a question, something unexpected occurred.\n\nFrom within the array piece, a wisp of black smoke emerged, thin and eerie, like mist in the shape of a serpent.\n\nThe moment it appeared, the entire atmosphere shifted.\n\nIt was as if hell itself had descended into the room.\n\nA wave of oppressive cold and gloom settled over the area.\n\nEveryone, except Gu Jun, was immediately suppressed by the pressure.\n\nAs soon as it emerged, the smoke-like entity darted toward Gu Jun, clearly recognizing its true target.\n\nIts speed was blindingly fast. Even the Left Protector, a peak Innate-level expert, couldn’t track its movement, let alone react.\n\nAll of Gu Jun’s hidden guards and companions attempted to intervene, but they were heavily suppressed, paralyzed by the overwhelming presence of the entity. They realized at once that this thing or being existed on a level far beyond their own.\n\nThere was now nothing between Gu Jun and the smoke-like thing.\n\nHe stared at it with narrowed eyes.\n\nAs it plunged toward him and began to enter his body—\n\nA flash of brilliant purple light erupted.",

            "content": "The purple light emerged from Gu Jun’s body.\n\nNo one saw how it appeared.\n\nFor the first time in many years, the Left Protector was genuinely afraid.\n\nEven if he didn’t know exactly what that purple light was, he could feel that it was something utterly unfathomable. Despite being one of the top powerhouses on Earth, he felt completely vulnerable before it. That smoke-like thing had been terrifyingly powerful, but this purple light… it belonged to an entirely different realm. It held the power to suppress the world itself. The Left Protector understood clearly: whatever that thing was, whether a person or a weapon, it hadn’t even revealed itself. That light was merely a glimpse of its power, and even that had surpassed his imagination.\n\nHe quickly turned toward Gu Jun and bowed deeply.\n“Your Highness, are you alright? I sincerely apologize; my negligence brought danger upon you. Please punish me.”\n\nGu Jun responded calmly, “Stand up. Don’t worry, I’m fine. And you’re not to blame. That thing’s level far exceeds yours. What you need to do is be more careful. Earth is not a simple place.”\n\n“Yes, Your Highness. I will remember your words.”\n\nAt that moment, XuanZhi spoke. “From start to finish, it was a trap.”\n\nGu Jun nodded slightly. “Hmm.”\n\nThen he turned and exited the room, instructing the Left Protector to stand down. As he walked toward another chamber, the Right Protector joined him midway.\n\nThey arrived at a different office chamber, which belonged to the Tenth Elder. Now, it was occupied only by Code Z.\n\nAs Gu Jun entered, Code Z, who had been sitting at a desk, immediately stood and gave a deep bow.\n\nGu Jun asked, “What is the family situation of Code B?”\n\n“Your Highness, he only had a daughter, no other relatives.”\n\n“Very well. Ensure her safety. If possible, bring her to Tianhai.”\n\nThen Gu Jun turned to the Right Protector.\n“Add him to the highest level of the Honor List. His bravery and loyalty deserve it.”\n\n“I have received the order, Your Highness.”\n\n“Hmm.”\n\nAfter finishing everything, Gu Jun left the base.\n\nNow there were four cars in the convoy, one more than before, added to accommodate the Ice Phoenix.\n\nGu Jun had decided to give the bird to Di Yan.\n\nShe hadn’t come with him today.\n\nIt was already late at night when Gu Jun arrived at his residence.\n\nOnce he got home, he called for Di Yan. She looked at him with surprise. Gu Jun rarely called her personally. So why tonight?\n\nGu Jun said plainly, “You’ve been with me for a long time. But your strength is far too low.”\n\nAs soon as she heard the first part, Di Yan smiled slightly, pleased. But the second part crushed her mood instantly.\n\nShe stared at Gu Jun coldly. “So?”\n\n“So,” Gu Jun continued, “I’ve decided to give you a gift. It will greatly enhance your strength.”\n\nDi Yan eyed him suspiciously. “Really?”\n\n“Yes. Don’t you believe me?”\n\nShe didn’t respond, still watching him warily.\n\nGu Jun sighed and looked at her with a slightly exasperated expression.\n“Come with me.”\n\nThey walked together into the inner section of the house.\n\nThere, a large crate stood in the center of the room.\n\nGu Jun gestured toward it. “Inside this crate is a bird, a variant of the Ice Phoenix.”\n\nDi Yan’s eyes widened. “Oh…”\n\nDi Yan didn’t look very interested at first.\n\nGu Jun smiled faintly and said, “Right now, it’s at the semi-innate level. But not long ago, it was at the mid to late stage of the innate realm.”\n\nThis time, Di Yan was clearly moved. Her eyes widened in surprise.\n\nInnate—that word carried immense weight for Earth’s cultivators. It symbolized power, prestige, and fear. Even a semi-innate creature was incredibly rare. A being at that level could cause massive destruction in Tianhai, and very few could stop it.\n\nShe turned toward the crate, now gazing at it with reverence.\nForget about innate; just a semi-innate beast alone was enough to dominate.\n\nGu Jun looked at her and added, “I have a method to form a contract between you and the phoenix. Once it’s done, you’ll be able to control it. You’ll understand each other instinctively. You can use it in combat, or however else you choose. Pretty cool, right?”\n\nUnlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.\n\nDi Yan narrowed her eyes. “It’s nearly at the innate level. Are you sure I’ll be able to control it?”\n\n“Don’t worry. Once the contract is complete, it will recognize you.”\n\n“Fine. I’ll reluctantly believe you.”\n\nGu Jun chuckled. “Come with me.”\n\nThey walked deeper into the house and arrived at the largest room, the main hall.\n\nThis community was a high-end one, so the construction and layout of the houses were top-tier. The main hall itself was spacious and well-designed.\n\nAt the moment, all the furniture had been cleared out.\nLi Ming was already inside, carefully drawing an intricate formation on the floor.\n\nThe entire room was filled with the soothing aroma of incense.\n\nAs Di Yan stepped into the space, she felt a subtle, sacred energy radiating from the formation. It stirred something in her heart, a feeling of awe, as if the room itself had been sanctified.\n\nGu Jun handed her a scroll containing the mantra required for the ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, Li Ming and Lin Mo left briefly, returning with a vial of the phoenix’s heart blood.\n\nDi Yan sat down in the center of the formation and began to chant the mantra, just as she’d been instructed.\n\nIt took nearly three hours to complete the ritual.\n\nSeveral times during the process, Di Yan had to be revitalized due to her dwindling vitality. Gu Jun didn’t hesitate; he used some of his finest pills to keep her going.\n\nOnce the ritual was finally over, Di Yan couldn’t hold on any longer. She fell into a deep sleep.\n\nBy then, it was almost morning, and Gu Jun couldn’t sleep; he had promised Uncle Tang that he’d come over for breakfast.\n\nAfter a short rest, Gu Jun left the house, hailed a taxi, and headed to Uncle Tang’s residence. Di Yan was still asleep, an unusual sight for someone at the peak of the Dark Level. It showed just how much the ritual had drained her.\n\nEveryone at Uncle Tang’s house was already gathered for breakfast.\n\nAfter the meal, they had a small sit-down together in the living room.\n\nUncle Tang smiled and asked, “So, how are you doing? How was your first day at university?”\n\nBefore Gu Jun could reply, Tang Xia smirked and said, “He’s living a very sweet life, both inside and outside the university.”\n\nGu Jun glanced at her.\n\nShe clearly knew everything that had happened at the nightclub.\n\nAfter that, Gu Jun stepped out and got into Tang Mei’s car; he would be heading to the university with her.\n\nAs soon as he settled into the passenger seat, a divine sense transmission arrived from Li Ming.\n\n“Your Highness, we have an intruder at Miss Bai Yue’s residence. Our team hasn’t identified his purpose yet. He appears to be at mid-stage Dark Level. The bodyguards have been neutralized, and only one person remains in the house. Should we intervene?”\n\n“Who?”\n\nAlthough he spoke in a low voice, the confined space of the car made it easy for Tang Mei to hear him. She gave him a curious look.\n\nGu Jun didn’t respond to her. He was thinking.\n\nLast night, Bai Yue had gone completely off the radar; for all the interested factions, she had seemingly vanished. That kind of disappearance could only be caused by someone with immense influence. Now, with their nerves fraying and no clue who had neutralized their surveillance, some of those factions were bound to react with aggression.\n\nThen the reply came from Li Ming.\n\n“Rong Xi.”\n\nGu Jun was momentarily stunned when he heard the name.\nThen, suddenly, he laughed, loud and nonchalant.\n\nTang Mei jumped slightly at the sound, startled. She looked at him and muttered, “Weirdo.”\n\n“No,” Gu Jun replied to Li Ming, still smiling.\n\nBai Yue’s Residence.\n\nRong Xi stood by the window, watching in horror as the bodyguards were killed.\n\nShe was trembling.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nFirst, I need to signal the family.\n\nShe pressed a small button hidden within her ring, which would send out a distress signal.\n\nNext, I have to call RAB.\n\nRAB was a government organization, similar to the police, but they only handled cases involving cultivators and other special entities.\n\nShe quickly dialed their number and gave them the address.\n\nAfter that, she began to calm down. The suddenness of the attack had caught her off guard, but she wasn’t completely defenseless.\n\nShe knew that no matter who the intruder was, it was rare for anyone to have the nerve to kill her or any woman living in this household. If someone dared, they had to be backed by a truly rogue influence, or perhaps chaos had already begun to unfold.\n\nEven though Rong Xi had regained some composure, she had no intention of being caught. The fact that the intruder had already killed the bodyguards meant this was no empty threat.\n\nShe ran quickly and hid under the bed in the maid's room.\n\nThen she heard footsteps, rapid and erratic, echoing throughout the house.\n\nIt was just one person, but he moved incredibly fast.\n\nThe intruder was, in fact, an assassin.\n\nHe hailed from Cloud Island, the most notorious rogue force in the world.\n\nNo matter how structured or civilized the world may seem, there are always some reckless influences who rise, believing they can do whatever they please. And when they cross the line too far, sooner or later, someone comes along and wipes them out completely.\n\nCloud Island was one such rogue force. It was incredibly powerful, classified near the order of Thirty-Three, but its time was almost up.\n\nAfter searching all the bedrooms, the assassin moved toward the maid’s quarters.\n\nHe already sensed that someone was hiding there.\n\nHe stopped in front of the room where Rong Xi was hiding.\n\nInside, Rong Xi felt her heart pounding so hard it was as if it might burst out of her chest.\n\nThe assassin stepped closer to the bed she was under.\n\nHe crouched down and looked under the bed.\n\nWhat he saw made his blood run cold.\n\nTwo eyes stared back at him, glowing red, like molten fire.\n\nBefore he could even react, a slender, beautiful finger with a razor-sharp nail pierced straight through his forehead.\n\nAnd then… everything went black.",

            "content": "It happened around fifty years ago.\nSeveral fragments fell from the sky along with a meteor.\n\nThey landed in different places, breaking into multiple pieces.\n\nA few years later, governments around the world realized that these fragments were not ordinary meteorites; they gave off strange readings.\n\nThis discovery triggered a global race to collect as many of these fragments as possible.\n\nNaturally, the three major countries acquired the largest share.\n\nScientific analysis began soon after.\n\nSome nations used the material for healthcare, others for the energy sector, but most directed it toward military applications.\n\nCountry M and Country B used it to power their advanced machinery, and in some cases, to create devastating weapons.\n\nCountry X also applied it in these sectors, but their primary focus was on experimenting with humans.\n\nAfter years of intense research and billions of yuan in funding, they discovered how to use this material, named Suncore worldwide, to enhance human cultivation.\n\nIt is said that with Suncore, one could potentially reach the innate level of cultivation.\n\nBut if it were that easy, it would be too good to be true.\n\nTo use Suncore for cultivation, one must endure immense suffering.\n\nIn addition, you must have perfect health, suitable physical attributes, and the proper equipment.\n\nEven with all these conditions met, success is not guaranteed.\n\nReaching the dark level might be possible, but the innate level? Almost impossible.\n\nEven under the best circumstances, perhaps one in a thousand will succeed. Failure, on the other hand, almost always means death.\n\nAnd that’s after removing as much toxicity as possible. If the toxins are not properly eliminated, the chances of success drop to nearly zero.\n\nIn the whole of Country X, very few people have succeeded in doing this. The exact number is unknown, but it likely does not exceed ten, and most of them are from the government, which has the best technology and resources for removing the toxicity.\n\nThree days ago – Arctic.\n\nAfter most of the ice in the region melted, new possibilities opened for humanity and for the nations of the world. A new sea route opened, a new landmass emerged from beneath the melted ice, and most importantly, a vast deposit of rare earth materials was discovered.\n\nAnd, as always, humans did what they do best: they began dividing the territory among themselves.\n\nOnce again, most of the land went to the three most powerful countries.\n\nAnd with power came military presence.\nThis is now one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world.\n\nOn an ice cap in the Arctic stood a man.\nHis name was Yang Leng.\n\nHe was unknown to ordinary people; after all, he was no celebrity, but within certain circles, his name carried heavy weight. In the global military community, Yang Leng was a legend.\n\nIn fact, he might be the most famous innate warrior ever created using Suncore.\n\nNow, he served as the commander of Silver Spear, the most elite and deadly special forces unit in Country X’s military.\n\nHe and his team were in the Arctic on a mission.\n\nThe operation was nearly complete. A few minor tasks remained, but they could be handled by others; Yang Leng’s part was done.\n\nJust as he prepared to head back to base, a phone call came.\n\nAfter hearing what was said on the phone, Yang Leng’s fury erupted, and the icecap under his feet was destroyed.\nAt that moment, everything changed.\n\nTwo days ago.\n\nYang Leng stood by the window of a small apartment in the capital.\n\nThis tale has been unlawfully lifted without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.\n\nBeside him stood a girl.\n\nHe looked at the window and said quietly,\n\n“So… this is the window she jumped from.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThe girl Yang Leng was speaking to was named Qiao Fenger.\nShe was the younger sister of one of his closest friends.\n\nWhen Yang Leng had first joined the army, that friend had enlisted alongside him. They had been life-and-death companions, and he had proven his loyalty through his actions.\n\nBack when they were ordinary foot soldiers, during one mission, that friend had taken a bullet for Yang Leng. He didn’t die instantly; he survived for a year, but in the end, he succumbed to the health complications caused by that wound.\n\nBefore his death, he had made Yang Leng promise to take care of his only sister.\n\nAnd now… this.\n\n“Tell me everything again,” Yang Leng said.\n\n“We saw this talent-hunting ad in an online newspaper,” she began. “They were looking for actresses. We were in the final year at our art college, so we decided to give it a try. It was a mistake; we didn’t investigate properly. The company was new, owned by some wealthy playboy from the capital.\n\n“When we went there, I was disqualified, but Fenger was selected. She was so happy that night.\n\n“Two days later, she came running home, and there was blood on her dress. I learned that a friend of the company president wanted her to be his mistress. She refused. After that, they forcibly drugged her with something addictive, planning to keep her under their control.\n\n“She acted along at first, and when she got the chance, she stabbed him in the genitals. During the chaos, she escaped and came home. She wanted to call you but didn’t get the chance.\n\n“Later, several police cars followed her, along with the company’s private guards. When they tried to catch her, she jumped.”\n\n“Hmm.”\n\nThe sound that escaped Yang Leng’s lips was so cold that Qiao Fenger nearly fainted. Sweat broke out across her skin.\n\nJust then, a phone rang.\n\nYang Leng answered.\n\nThere was silence for a few seconds on the other end. Then a voice spoke:\n\n“Yang Leng, why are you in the country? I know there may be some issues here, but you can’t just leave your post. Your mission still isn’t complete.”\n\nAt first, Yang Leng said nothing. Then he suddenly laughed.\n\nThat laugh was so cold that everyone within a one-square-kilometer radius felt a chill crawl down their spine. In the capital, where many warriors resided, the effect was even stronger. They all turned their eyes toward the apartment where Yang Leng stood. Their gazes were filled with both fear and reverence.\n\nSome powerful warrior murmured “Innate”\n\n“I worked as a simple soldier. Then you convinced me, no, you even morally blackmailed me, into taking the Suncore. Fine. It was your duty. I won’t blame you for that.\n\n“After hellish suffering, I somehow survived and became an innate warrior. Since then, I’ve been serving this country without hesitation.\n\n“And this is how I’m repaid? My sister, who was also the sister of my best friend, the same friend who gave his life for this country, was forced to jump. My sister… the sister of two soldiers… the sister of an innate warrior… was forced to jump.\n\n“And you didn’t help her. Worse, you’re now playing mind games with me.\n\n“And the man responsible is enjoying seven-star treatment in a hospital.\n\n“You ask me why I left my post? So you’re saying I should keep fighting… so animals like that can live happy, promiscuous lives?”\n\nThere was a long sigh from the other end of the line. Then came the reply:\n\n“Alright… forgive me for this. But the situation was complicated. The man your sister stabbed was from the Ning family and held a prominent identity.\n\n“You should know the Ning family. They might not be that impressive on their own, but they’re connected to two of the Thirty-Three Great Influences, the Zi family and the Han family.”\n\n“What prominent identity? He’s just a spoiled dandy.”\n\n“He’s indeed a dandy, but his mother is from the Han family; she’s the youngest daughter of the current Han family head. She has a special place in his heart. Because of that, we had to be careful. But ultimately… we did manage to save her.”\n\n“Save her? She’s in a coma, and there’s almost no chance she’ll wake up. She’s just a normal person, not a cultivator.”\n\nYang Leng took a deep breath.\n“Alright. I know why you're calling. You don’t have to worry about it. I’ll take care of it.”\n\n“How are you going to take care of it?”\n\n“You don’t need to know.”\n\n“What do you mean, I don’t need to know? You’re my soldier, our soldier, the face of Country X’s military and the pride of our nation. You should know we have to be careful. This involves the Ning family, the Han family… and even the Zi family.”\n\n“Huh, the Han family may be a problem, but don’t tell me about the Zi family. I know very well they don’t have a good relationship with the Ning family.”\n\n“That may be true, but even for the sake of the family’s reputation, they might be forced to take action. Overall, you should avoid being impulsive. You don’t know much about the strength of the Han and Ning families. We can take revenge, but we must be careful. Listen to me… hello? Hello?”\n\nIn the capital military region, also known as the Nator Military Region, inside one of the central rooms, an old man threw his phone away in a fit of rage.\n\n“Damn it, too arrogant!”\n\nSuddenly, another older man entered the chamber.\nHe then sat on a chair and asked, “What did he say?”\n\n“Boss, this boy is too arrogant. He’ll surely create trouble. The situation in the capital will collapse.”\n\n“Isn't it normal?”",

            "content": "These two old men were anything but ordinary. They were not mere soldiers; they were pillars of Country X’s military.\n\nThe man who spoke with Yang Leng was the deputy commander of the Nator Military Region. The second, who followed him in, was the commander himself, the supreme authority in this powerful region.\n\nThe deputy commander leaned slightly toward his superior, his voice low and grim.\n“Boss, what do you think? Could it really come to an innate-level clash in the capital? If it does… what’s our move? The procedures are clear enough, but this time, one of the fighters is one of our own. Do we follow protocol, or do we protect him?”\n\nThe commander’s eyes narrowed. He tapped a finger lightly against the armrest, a habit of his when deep in thought.\n“Hmph. Naturally, we safeguard our asset. But you and I both know this situation isn’t simple. Too many factions have dipped their hands in already. Unexpected turns are inevitable. Still… as things stand, the majority of influential forces are leaning toward supporting Yang Leng. As for an innate-level battle—” He gave a faint smile. “That is not something you should be overly concerned about. You know why.”\n\n“I understand, Boss,” the deputy commander said with a nod. Then, after a pause, his eyes flickered with unease. “But what I can’t figure out is… if the innates really cross swords, how much will the Azure Tower intervene?”\n\nNator Military Hospital.\nA VIP ward, dimly lit.\n\nYang Leng sat at the bedside, staring at the fragile figure lying under a web of medical instruments.\n\nQiao Feng’er.\n\nHis hand trembled as he clenched it into a fist. He reached out, placing his palm gently against her forehead, searching for some sign of warmth, of life, of hope. But there was nothing. Just silence.\n\nSlowly, he pulled his hand back, his eyes burning with a storm of emotions.\n\nThe doctors had spoken plainly: there was little hope.\n\nSorry, little sister… But don’t worry. I’ll take care of those bastards. I’ll make them bleed for what they did. I’ll carry your hatred on my back until the debt is paid in full.\n\nThe Ning family and the Han family had already realized the storm they had invited upon themselves. The girl that their spoiled heirs had dared to harm was no ordinary victim; she was the sister of an innate cultivator. Not just any innate, but a war hero, draped in the prestige of the military.\n\nAnd the military was not a force that could be offended lightly. It was a vast and perilous behemoth.\n\nThe moment Yang Leng returned to the capital, countless eyes turned toward him.\n\nThe capital itself seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the storm that was about to break.\n\nIn the depths of the city, hidden beneath an unmarked building, there was an underground chamber.\n\nSeven figures sat inside, their gazes fixed on glowing screens and spiritual monitoring arrays. These were the shadows tasked with watching every movement of Yang Leng.\n\nAnd then…\n\nBoom!\n\nThe world above seemed to shatter. A deafening explosion ripped through the chamber, swallowing it whole in an instant. Walls caved, flames roared, and dust surged upward like a dragon of smoke. The seven observers never had the chance to scream.\n\nBut the interesting part was not their deaths.\n\nLurking in the darkness nearby were others, agents from other factions, secretly monitoring those who had been monitoring Yang Leng. When the explosion tore through the underground room, they quietly withdrew. Some wore expressions of delight, some shock, and others cold indifference.\n\nWithin ten minutes of the blast, the Han and Ning families received the news. The Ning household in particular descended into chaos. Their pampered heir, Ning Fang, was lying injured in a hospital bed, and now the very enemy they dreaded was on the move. They scrambled to respond, but it was already too late.\n\nNator United Hospital.\nOne of the most prestigious institutions in the capital. Its halls combined cutting-edge modern medicine with the ancient arts of renowned medical sects. Officially, it was a hospital. In truth, it was also a fortress, and it belonged to the Ning family.\n\nYang Leng stood outside its towering entrance.\n\nHis steps were unhurried, almost casual, as he pushed open the glass doors.\n\nThe moment he crossed the threshold—\n\nWEE-OO! WEE-OO!\n\nThe alarms blared, echoing through every corridor. His photo, flagged in the database, had triggered the hospital’s security system.\n\nIn an instant, the entire building came alive. Hallways filled with shouting, staircases thundered with footsteps. Warriors appeared one after another, some of the Bright Realm, others of the Dark Realm, and even several of the demi-Huajin Realm.\n\nYang Leng’s gaze swept over them once.\n\nThat was all it took.\n\nTheir bodies stiffened, their movements locked as though chains of invisible iron bound them. They were Bright and Dark Realm cultivators, so before his overwhelming aura, they were no more than ants.\n\nThis novel's true home is a different platform. Support the author by finding it there.\n\nYang Leng walked past them without pause, his expression indifferent.\n\nAnd then… the horror began.\n\nOne by one, the warriors dissolved. Their bodies shimmered faintly before unraveling into wisps of smoke, evaporating as though they had never existed.\n\nBy the time Yang Leng’s footsteps faded into the next corridor, the hall was empty.\n\nFrom beginning to end, he had never even looked them in the eye.\n\nYang Leng stepped onto the stairway.\n\nWarriors rushed at him in wave after wave. Their blades glinted, their spiritual auras surged, their footsteps thundered.\n\nThe result never changed.\n\nDeath.\n\nThey fell like wheat before the scythe, collapsing one after another.\n\nAt some point, his indifference shifted into boredom. Do they not understand? Before an innate cultivator, their resistance was meaningless. Yet still they came, tide after tide, moths drawn to the flame.\n\nBy his count, nearly a hundred warriors had already fallen, two of them even Huajin experts.\n\nAnd still, they came.\n\nFinally, Yang Leng reached the corridor that led to the VIP cabin where Ning Fang lay.\n\nTwo Huajin warriors stood guard at the door. Unlike the rest, Yang Leng recognized them immediately; they were from the Han family.\n\nHis gaze sharpened. He spoke in a calm voice, but his tone was as heavy as steel.\n“I have no wish for enmity with the Han family. You both should know that what lies in that cabin is worthless. Not worth opposing me. Let me kill him, and this ends here.”\n\nThe two Huajin remained silent. Their eyes flickered, their grips tightened on their weapons, but they did not move aside.\n\nYang Leng understood the situation. His divine sense surged outward, descending upon them like a mountain. Crushing pressure bent the walls and warped the air.\n\nBut unlike the lesser warriors before them, they did not crumble immediately. Mid-stage Huajin, armed with powerful defensive tools, so they held on, though their eyes betrayed the horror that clawed at their hearts.\n\nYang Leng did not waste words.\n\nHe raised his index finger.\n\nTwo streaks of white light shot forth, faster than thought. They pierced directly through the warriors’ foreheads. Then blood trickled down from the tiny, perfect wounds on their brows. Their bodies slumped lifelessly to the ground.\n\nSwift, clean, and absolute.\n\nYang Leng flicked his hand, and the corpses dissolved into nothingness, erased from the world. Huajin bodies were treasures of immense value, but tonight, such things meant nothing to him.\n\nWithout another glance, he pushed open the door and stepped into the cabin.\n\nOne minute later, the suite door opened again.\n\nThree figures entered.\n\nThe air itself seemed to tighten.\n\nAt the front stood an early-stage innate expert. This man was one of the ancestors of the Ning family.\n\nBehind him were two more. Both at the peak of the Huajin Realm. One was Ning Fang’s paternal grandfather. The other, an elder of the Han family.\n\nWhen the three figures entered the suite, the first thing they saw was Ning Feng lying on the bed. At first glance, he seemed to be sleeping peacefully.\n\nBut their divine senses told a different story.\n\nHe was dead.\n\nNot the clean death of a warrior, but something far worse.\n\nEvery bone in his body was shattered. His organs had been crushed, his flesh torn apart from the inside out. The remains before them were not of a man who had merely died; they were the remnants of someone who had suffered a death soaked in agony.\n\nThe three men stared down at the body, rage burning in their eyes.\n\nThis was not simply the death of a pampered heir. This was a blatant insult, a slap across the face of two great families.\n\nEspecially for the Han family, one of the Order of Thirty-Three, it was more than an insult. It was provocation, a direct challenge to their authority.\n\nThere could be no forgiveness. Only vengeance. Brutal, unrelenting vengeance, so that no one else would ever dare the same.\n\nSome time later.\n\nA military plane touched down on the private runway of the capital’s armed forces.\n\nFrom its cabin descended a tall and beautiful woman. Luo Yan.\n\nHer long strides carried a mixture of grace and urgency. She was a member of the elite military circle, her family long established and powerful within its ranks. More than that, she was known to many as Yang Leng’s potential lover. For years, she had pursued him, hoping to win a place in his heart. She had not yet succeeded, but now she believed she was close.\n\nNow, however, all such thoughts were drowned beneath a tide of unease.\n\nThe entire elite circle already knew: Yang Leng had killed Ning Feng.\n\nAnd Luo Yan understood better than most what that meant. Her family’s heritage gave her insight into the ruthless laws of power. She knew how the great families operated, how they washed away insult with blood. The Nings and Hans would not let this go.\n\nWorry gnawed at her chest.\n\nInstead of returning home, she slid into a black car bearing military plates. The vehicle carried her away from the airport, past the bustling streets, toward Uptown. Her destination was not a residence, but a place whispered about in hushed tones.\n\nThe Holy Lotus Club.\n\nA fortress of influence, hidden behind the mask of luxury. Established nearly fifteen years ago, it was less a club and more a sanctum of power. Few dared oppose it, not only because of the mystery and fear that shrouded it, but because its moves were always precise, never reckless.\n\nBy the time Luo Yan’s car stopped before its gates, an hour had passed.\n\nThe building loomed like a modern castle, its marble walls glowing under the soft shimmer of countless lights, Elegant and Quiet.\n\nLuo Yan barely spared it a glance. She hurried inside.\n\nThe ground floor was alive with music and laughter. Men and women lounged with drinks in hand, their laughter sharp, their eyes sharper. Luo Yan instantly recognized faces from the upper echelons, members of the Dongfeng clan, the Zi family, and other powerful influences.\n\nAmong them sat the youngest daughter of the Dongfeng family; her presence was radiant beneath the lights.\n\nHer eyes tracked Luo Yan, who was moving swiftly toward the upper floors.\n\nWithout hesitation, the Dongfeng girl reached for her phone. Her expression shifted as she lifted it to her ear.\n\nShe was calling her elder sister.",

            "content": "Among the three great orders of the thirty-three families of Country X, each had carved out its own domain of power. The Zi family stood at the forefront of politics and the military. The Han family was famed for its cultivation might, feared and respected across the land. And then there was the Dongfeng family, masters of commerce and pioneers of military technology.\n\nSo the Dongfeng is the wealthiest family; only the Eastern Bank and the Medicine God Sect are richer than they are in Country X.\n\nBut what truly set them apart was not just their riches or their reach. It was their ability to raise successors. They had long understood a simple truth: the future of a clan rested not on past glory but on the heirs who carried its torch. A prosperous future demanded capable hands. Thus, they devoted great care to grooming their next generation. Each lineage had produced its share of useless dandies, but alongside them always emerged figures of brilliance.\n\nAnd in this era, brilliance often came dressed in silk and ambition. It was the age of remarkable women, daughters who burned with a sharper fire than many sons.\n\nAmong them, Dongfeng Bingling shone the brightest. She was already being hailed as one of the two top flowers of the capital, due to her beauty and capability. Though her family’s strength lay in business and technology, her heart had always leaned toward politics. Upon graduating from Capital University, she entered the Central Political School, where she achieved record results. Now, she served as the secretary to the mayor of Nator, an enviable position for someone so young.\n\nNator Mayor’s Office\n\nDongfeng Bingling sat at her desk, arranging documents for an upcoming meeting. The phone on her table buzzed, interrupting her concentration. She glanced at the caller ID and picked it up.\n\nHer sister’s voice came through, hushed but urgent.\n“Sister, I just saw Luo Han head into the office floor of the Holy Lotus Club. It must be connected to Captain Yang Leng’s matter.”\n\nBingling leaned back in her chair, thoughtful. “Hmm… if Luo Han has gone there, then perhaps the club, or the power behind it, plans to move in this situation.”\n\n“Yes. And if they do, we might finally glimpse the true strength behind the Holy Lotus Club.”\n\nA faint smile curved Bingling’s lips, though her tone remained measured. “Don’t get your hopes up. The club has always been cautious. They won’t act just for the sake of friendship.”\n\n“…Understood, sister.”\n\nThe call ended, but Bingling’s eyes lingered on the silent phone, a flicker of calculation passing through them.\n\nOn the other hand, Luo Han did not take the lift when she entered the fifth floor of the Holy Lotus Club. Instead, she chose the stairway, ensuring that everyone along the way saw her arrival. It was a calculated move, a clever trick that forced the club into a position where silence would be costly.\n\nSuch tactics were not uncommon. Families, factions, even entire nations had used similar methods to achieve their ends. Luo Han wanted the message clear: she had come here to seek aid. Now, if the club ignored her, there were only two possible reasons.\n\nThe first, that they simply refused. But all the capital elites knew she was a close friend of the club’s manager. For the manager to abandon her now would make the club appear heartless, its reputation stained.\n\nThe second, that the club was incapable of helping. That possibility was far more dangerous. The Holy Lotus Club thrived on its aura of mystery and power. If the veil of strength were torn away, their influence would crumble.\n\nAfter a while, Luo Han sat across from the massive office desk. On the other side, in the seat of authority, was a woman of about thirty-five, elegant, striking, and commanding. She was the club's manager.\n\nThe woman studied Luo Han, lips curling into a faint smile. “Girl, you grow more cunning with each visit.”\n\nA flush of embarrassment colored Luo Han’s face. None of her little maneuvers could escape this woman’s eyes. After all, the manager had spent years weaving through the capital’s elites.\n\n“I’m sorry, Sister,” Luo Han said softly. “I truly don’t know what else to do.”\n\nThe manager leaned back, her expression gentling. “Hmm. You are still just a young girl. I can’t blame you. And… the situation truly is dire.”\n\nLuo Han’s heart sank. Panic flickered in her eyes. “Sister, even you are saying that?”\n\n“It isn’t the worst yet,” the woman replied calmly. “Listen carefully. I have already reported everything to my master. But my master cannot act on her own will. Approval must come from the top level. That hasn’t happened yet. Still… your lover is an innate. That alone makes him precious, something every great power covets. I believe the top level will lend a hand. But I cannot say for certain. If they refuse, then I can only rely on my own strength and the club’s. Yet against more than one innate, that may not be enough.”\n\nTaken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.\n\nHer gaze drifted for a moment, her voice dropping almost unconsciously. “In the end, your best hope lies in that person’s decision. If he agrees… everything will be resolved.”\n\nLuo Han blinked, confusion written across her face. “That person?”\n\nThe manager’s eyes sharpened instantly, like a blade drawn from its sheath. She snapped back to the present, her stare cutting into Luo Han’s hesitation. “Forget what I just said. It’s better for you that way.”\n\n“…Alright, Sister.” Luo Han lowered her head.\n\nThe manager’s voice softened again. “Don’t torment yourself with worry. I’m still waiting for the reply from the top brass. The situation is not beyond recovery. Remember, there are countless powers in the capital, each with its own schemes. Until the very end, no one can predict the outcome.”\n\nThe manager paused for a moment, then added quietly, “And there is also… the Azure Tower.”\n\nAt those words, Luo Han’s eyes brightened faintly, a spark of hope flickering across her face.\n\nThe Azure Tower.\n\nThe most mysterious and powerful artifact in all of Country X, perhaps even on the entire earth. People called it a mysterious-grade tool, not an innate tool, because no one truly knew its origin or rank. Its existence defied the limits of human knowledge. What was certain, however, was that it stood above anything an innate warrior could wield.\n\nUnlike innate tools, the Azure Tower possessed a will of its own, a tool spirit. It could act independently, and that alone set it apart from anything mortals could comprehend.\n\nAnd its function?\nIt governed the innates themselves.\n\nEvery innate warrior in Country X, and beyond, was subject to its unseen oversight. Upon breaking through to the innate realm, a warrior was automatically registered by the tower, their life force branded into its system. From that moment on, they were bound by codes of conduct. Any who dared defy them would face the tower’s judgment, swift and merciless.\n\nIt was because of this unseen law that peak innates, upon reaching the summit of their cultivation, were compelled to leave the mortal world behind. The tower tolerated no imbalance that threatened the fragile equilibrium of the mundane realm.\n\nYet, the Azure Tower was not a tyrant. It carried no personal stake, no bias. Its judgments were considered the purest form of justice in existence. In times of conflict, if innates clashed and the destruction threatened civilian lives, the tower would intervene. Sometimes it would even open an independent space, a sealed battlefield where warriors could unleash their might without endangering the world outside.\n\nTo cultivators of Country X, the Azure Tower was more than a tool. It was the silent guardian of the entire cultivation order. None dared defy its authority.\n\nBut its power did not rest solely on automatic enforcement. There was also a way to petition the tower, though it was far from simple. The process operated like a vast, impartial council. Seven votes were held by the highest-ranking government officials of Country X, seven more by the seven thirty-three great influences of Country X, and every peak innate held a single vote of their own. Only with sixty percent approval could a petition be brought before the tower’s spirit for judgment.\n\nThis system ensured that no single force, no matter how mighty, could bend the tower’s will.\n\nAnd it was because of the Azure Tower that the Holy Lotus Club could exist at all.\n\nA mysterious influence of unknown origin, the club should have been torn apart long ago by the combined weight of the capital’s great factions. But none dared to make the move. To provoke a force as enigmatic as the Holy Lotus Club without absolute certainty risked destabilizing the entire chessboard. Under the watchful presence of the tower, no one would take that gamble.\n\nOf course, the Azure Tower was not the sole reason for the club’s survival. Careful maneuvering of relationships with other factions, deep financial resources, shrewd use of the laws of Country X, and a formidable reservoir of muscle ensured its continued rise.\n\nSo, in the grand game of the capital, the Azure Tower remained one of the greatest anchors of balance, an invisible hand pressing down on all sides of the board.\n\nAs Luo Han and the manager spoke in hushed tones, a sharp chime shattered the air. Both their phones vibrated on the desk at the same time, the identical alert tone echoing like a warning bell.\n\nTheir eyes met, a silent understanding passing between them. Slowly, they reached for their devices.\n\nThe manager’s expression hardened as she scanned the message, her face taking on a rare, dignified gravity. Luo Han’s hands trembled slightly, her features tightening with worry.\n\nThe message was brief, but its weight was crushing.\nIt was a joint statement from the Ning family and the Han family.\n\nFor a long moment, silence reigned inside the office. The only sound was the faint hum of the air conditioner, cold against the sudden heaviness in the room.\n\nFinally, it was Luo Han who broke the stillness, her voice strained.\n“Sister… say something.”\n\nThe manager exhaled slowly, her eyes narrowing as she summarized the words with deliberate calm.\n“The statement declares that Yang Leng has committed a heinous crime, slaughtering many warriors, even direct descendants of their families. They claim they cannot tolerate such madness, and they vow to retaliate.”\n\nHer tone grew sharper, each word carrying the weight of the threat.\n“They’ve also warned all other powers to stay away from this matter. No government, no military, no outside influence is to interfere. Their intent is clear: they will strike soon, and when they do, they will take their bloody revenge.”",
