    "description": "After a lifelong battle with illness, a young girl from Earth is reborn into the world of Pokémon as Peppa 'Pep' Carmine— the daughter of a prestigious family of Pokemon breeders. At the ripe age of seventeen, Pep's parents ship her off to the Sinnoh region, where she must attend classes at the elite Jubilife Trainer Academy. Peppa's parents have high hopes of molding her into a heiress that can live up to their expectations, but much to their chagrin, Pep isn't interested in what they think.\n\nShe's here to prove that there are no such thing as bad Pokémon-- only bad trainers.\n\nBest of the Worst is a Pokémon Fanfic that takes place in the Pokémon world. (Though a few details about the world itself have been changed.)\n\nThis is not a dark fic, but there will be some potentially triggering subject matter. (Bullying, illness, etc.)\n\nDisclaimer: I do not own the rights to Pokémon. (obviously.) All rights to the Pokémon franchise are reserved by Nintendo.",

You won't regret it.\n\nAn ambitious, but well launched fic. Where Pokemon SIs are a dime a dozen these days, Best of the Worst sets itself apart by slowly creating a fleshed out Pokemon world that manages to give itself a sense of care and uniqueness to it.\n\nThe characters are quirky enough to stand out, but not overwhelming enough to seem fake or too trope-ish. The Pokemon are written in a way to give them a good personality without seeming too human-like. The conflicts between characters have been a bit on the nose with cliches and could use some work to be more believable as to repercurssions, but they arent enough so to turn you away from the fic.\n\nThe Pokemon world is one that has been written about many times before, but Best of the Worst's quality makes it stand out from others of similar length and age. The author should be proud of what they have managed to evoke.\n\nAll in all, a well done story that I am looking forward to seeing updates from. Something of this quality deserves more exposure and I eagerly await to see what the author manages to accomplish next!\n\nAs of 13/11/25: The author continues to show improvement and try different things with their writing. The story has managed to stay fresh and I still have this story near the top of my watchlist.\n\n Report",

            "content": "Things didn't really pan out quite the way I had hoped.\n\nSure, I never had the highest of expectations for my life, but I had always expected it would amount to more than.. this.\n\nToday was my nineteenth birthday, and here I was spending it rotting away in a hospital bed, no family or friends in sight.\n\nI had been sick most of my life, and while I understood that the never-ending cycle of doctors and hospital visits was exhausting, I couldn't help but be bitter that I hadn't even received a call. Once I had turned eighteen, and legally became an adult, I suspected my family just wanted to be done with it all- not that I could blame them. My parents, after all, had given up quite a bit just to keep me alive. It couldn't have been easy.\n\nI sighed. \"Things could be worse.\" I thought to myself. At least my nurse had brought me a cupcake.\n\nI shifted uncomfortably, attempting to readjust myself, which always proved challenging while attached to an IV drip, among other assorted chords. I slumped back with a huff, looking down at the red Nintendo 3DS clutched in my hands. \"At least I have you guys.\" I chuckled quietly, suddenly finding myself choking back bitter tears. I allowed myself to cry for a bit and lament my own loneliness, but I eventually took a deep breath and wiped my tears away.\n\nOnce I managed to calm down, I began flipping through my Pokémon team members- all of which had been meticulously bred and trained to have ideal stats and move sets. Battles were far from my favorite part of this particular game, though. This game had a feature called PokéAmie, which was very reminiscent of Nintendogs. You could feed, pet, and play with your Pokémon-- which I absolutely adored.\n\nNothing beat feeding the Lord of Darkness Giratina little cupcakes, after all.\n\n\"There you go,\" I hummed, feeding one of my treasured companions a pokepuff. The Pokémon on the screen wiggled and cried happily. I couldn't help but crack a smile. I continued playing for a few hours, before closing my 3DS and placing it back on its charger.\n\n\"Goodnight,\" I sighed to the empty room, which had now grown dim. I lowered myself carefully amidst the chords, and drifted off to sleep.\n\n---------\n\nUpon regaining my awareness, I realized I was no longer in my bed, but standing- floating? in what appeared to be a bright white, featureless space.\n\n\"Where.. where am I?\" I wondered aloud to myself. I looked down at my hands, but instead found an aura of glowing color in their place. \"What the hell is- Okay. Don't panic. This is just a dream.\" I assured myself.\n\n\"I am sorry.\" A voice boomed, reverberating through my mind. \"I am afraid that this is not a dream.\"\n\n\"Then- what- who,\" I stammered. \"Huh?\"\n\n\"Listen.\" The voice replied solemnly.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, I heard noises off in the distance. The sound of frantic voices, and a shrill mechanical beeeeeeeeeeeeeep.\n\nAnd then nothing.\n\n\"That was..\"\n\n\"Yes, child. Unfortunately, your life has come to an end.\" The voice replied solemnly.\n\n\"Ah.. haha. I see.\" I chuckled. \"That.. really sucks.\"\n\nFor a while, everything was quiet.\nI thought back on my life, recalling good and bad memories alike. Beach trips. My favorite scented candle. My family dog. My childhood bully. Hospital rooms. Ice cream. Pokemon.\n\nResigning myself, I asked the voice, \"Okay. Now what?\"\n\n\"You seem to have processed this information rather quickly.\" The voice responded, betraying a hint of surprise.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, I don't want to be dead, but I had known for some time that this day was coming.\" I shrugged my non-existent shoulders.\n\n\"I see. How unfortunate.\"\n\n\"It is what it is.\"\n\nAfter a long pause, the voice responded again. \"Tell me, child. What is it that you desire most?\"\n\n\"I.. I'm not sure, really. All I ever really wanted was to live a normal life. To be happy, I guess.\" I pondered. \"If I could have anything, well.. I..,\" I paused.\n\n\"I just don't want to be alone anymore.\"\n\nBefore me, four spindly legs stepped out of what appeared to be a glowing, golden fog. I was sure I recognized this form from somewhere, but I couldn't quite make out any distinguishing features apart from its legs-- and what appeared to be glowing green eyes that stared back at me through the haze.\n\n\"If given the opportunity, would you wish to continue living?\" The form asked.\n\n\"Uh.. Do you mean like, reincarnation?\" I responded.\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\nI pondered the question for a few moments. My life had been short, but not particularly easy. It could have been worse, sure. I had seen plenty of other patients whose conditions were far more painful than my own, which made me hesitant to roll the dice on another life. What if I reincarnated just to suffer all over again?\n\nI swallowed at the thought. If the figure before me was to be believed, this could be my chance to do and experience all of the things I had missed out on in my short existence. Did I really fear pain more than I wanted to live?\n\n\"I suppose.. I could try again.\" I replied.\n\n\"I see. A bold decision, young one. Are you certain?\" The form asked.\n\n\"Yes.. I would like to try again.\" I finished.\n\nThe being before me stretched a spindly legs towards me, touching where my forehead would have been. All at once, I was enveloped by a warm, golden light.\n\nAs the being spoke, I felt a wave of calm wash over me. I let my form relax into the fog.\n\n\"Very well. Rest now, child. You will awaken very soon.\" The being's voice echoed in my mind.\n\nFinally giving into fatigue, I allowed my awareness to slip away from me, until there was nothing left but silence.\n\n---------\n\n\"Peppa dear, are you awake?\" Mother's voice called down the hall.\n\nI rubbed the sleep from my bleary eyes and stifled a yawn, before snuggling back into the soft covers.\n\n\"Five more minutes,\" I grumbled.\n\n\"Young lady, you simply cannot be late!\" Mother chided. \"You wouldn't want to miss your flight, would you?\"\n\nStolen novel; please report.\n\nI willed my eyes to remain shut, hoping to steal just a few more seconds of delicious sleep. \"I'm just.. so comfy.\" I muttered.\n\n\"Your Grandfather will be here to pick you up soon-- Do I need to get Mawhile?\"\n\nMy body stiffened, and I immediately darted up.\n\n\"That's what I thought.\" Mother chuckled, now standing in the doorway to my room. Her tiny menace of a pokémon hugged one of her legs, giving me a smug look.\n\nThe last thing I wanted was to be dragged my by ankles through the house by Mawhile's teeth again. I shuddered.\n\nFor a pokémon so small, her giant maw was extremely strong. Capable of throwing a person, I regrettably had discovered on numerous occasions.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" I huffed, lifting myself out of the bed and onto my feet. I pulled a loose sweater onto my body and shuffled past mother and her Mawhile, giving the pokémon a soft pat on the head.\n\n\"Mah-maw,\" the pokémon purred triumphantly.\n\nMawhile wasn't a bad pokémon; in fact, I quite liked her. She was just eager to please mother, not unlike the rest of the family. I could understand her enthusiasm, even if it often did result in me being rag dolled out of bed by my ankles.\n\n\"You're sure you've packed everything, right? Toothbrush, shampoo, underwear?\" Mother asked, following me down the hallway.\n\n\"Yes, Mother. I'm sure.\" I yawned.\n\n-------\n\nAs I brushed my teeth, I studied my reflection in the mirror. In this life I had been born quite the physical opposite to my previous one. I was certain that I had once been short and stocky, but in this life, I now possessed a long, gangly body- standing at about five feet and nine inches tall. Very tall for a girl, let alone a seventeen year old.\n\nI couldn't help but smirk. I had always wanted to be tall, so I felt that Arceus really did come through for me there. I stretched my noodly arms into a pose in the mirror.\n\"Perfection.\" I muttered, before setting to the task of wrangling my messy red hair into a halfway presentable bun.\n\n\"And she's so humble, too.\" A voice scoffed from behind me, causing me to jerk. Behind me in the mirror stood my younger brother, Florian.\n\nI felt my face flush.\n\n\"Admiring yourself again, I see.\" Florian huffed, rolling his eyes.\n\nFlorian was thirteen, turning fourteen this year. He stood at about chest height for me- he hadn't quite hit his growth spurt yet.\n\nI reached down and ruffled his red hair with one hand. \"Hey, it's important to love yourself, kiddo.\" I shrugged.\n\n\"Hey- cut it out!\" He laughed, trying his best to sound annoyed.\n\nI looked down at him and smiled.\n\n\"You're leaving today, right?\" He asked, looking a bit forlorn.\n\n\"Yeah, sorry Flor. You'll be able to join the academy next year, though.\" I replied. Florian gave a bit of a half-smile in response, but I could tell that he was just trying to be mature about it.\n\nThough this was definitely the Pokémon world, many things were distinctly different than I had remembered from the anime and games. Instead of setting off at ten years old, children were required to attend a 'regular' school until they were fourteen. After completing primary schooling, they then became eligible to enroll in a Trainer Academy, where they could study to obtain an official trainer license. As such, Florian wouldn't be able to join the Trainer Academy until next year, and by then I would be on my own journey. I couldn't help but feel a bit guilty for having to leave him behind.\n\n\"Well, can you hurry up? Some other people would like to use the bathroom.\" Florian said, crossing his arms.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah.. I'm almost done.\" I responded, returning to the task of making myself presentable.\n\nWhen I finished, I turned to Florian and lowered myself to give him a big hug. \"I'll miss you, Flor.\" I said, ruffling his curly red hair.\n\nHis disgruntled expression softened, betraying a sad smile. \"I'll miss you too, sis.\"\n\nFlorian really was a good kid.\n\n--------\n\nI hurried down the stairs, luggage in tow, and made my way into the front parlor. Father sat on the sofa reading the morning paper and sipping his coffee. At his feet, his Ninetales was curled up and sleeping. I said nothing, silently hoping he hadn't noticed me, and took a few steps towards the door.\n\n\"Peppa.\" Father's voice rumbled, causing me to stiffen.\n\n\"Yes, Father?\" I asked.\n\n\"Do not make a fool of yourself, young lady.\" He growled. \"I had better not receive any calls from the Academy this year.\"\n\nBefore I could say anything in response, Mother chimed in.\n\n\"Oh, relax dear. It will be fine.\" Mother smiled, despite giving me a pointed stare. \"I'm sure Peppa knows just how important this is.\"\n\nI grimaced. Being a member of the Carmine family meant that many eyes would be on me during my final year, before I officially made my debut as a trainer. If I looked bad, the whole family would look bad, which was not something my parents would abide.\n\nThe Carmine Family was well renowned throughout Hoenn for their expertise in pokémon breeding. They had made their fortune by selectively breeding highly sought-after pokémon, such as Eevee, Gardevoir, Skitty, Vulpix; the list goes on. Pokémon bred by the Carmine family were known to possess a unique and unrivaled beauty- a highly coveted feature among Pokemon Coordinators. Their Pokémon were the very picture of elegance and composure-- Not unlike the family themselves.\n\n\"I.. I'll do my best.\" I responded, giving a fake smile.\n\n\"See that you do.\" Father grumbled, before returning to reading his paper.\n\nNinetales stretched and sauntered over to me, before pushing her head into my side. I hugged the large fox-dog, giving her a scratch behind the ears. \"Niiiine.\" She whined.\n\n\"I'll see you soon girl,\" I assured her, giving her a final pat on the head.\n\nI finished saying my good-byes and headed for the door, smiling to myself. I wasn't about to let the grumpy old man put a damper on my spirits.\n\nThis was the year I finally got my own pokemon, after all.",

            "content": "\"Pfft. Don't listen to your father. He's always been a bit of a stick in the mud.\" Grandpa sniffed, his eyes focused on the road.\n\nAs soon as I had gotten into the car, he had quickly deduced something was amiss-- he seemed to have a sixth sense for things like that when it came to his grandchildren. Admittedly, I did feel a bit deflated, but I didn't think I was that easy to read. After a bit of prodding I had told him about the unceremonious-partly hostile-sendoff my father had given me earlier.\n\n\"He's worried that I might damage the family's reputation.\" I muttered, my gaze focused on a few Wingulls flying off into the distance. The sun had only barely begun to rise.\n\nIt had just now dawned on me (pun intended) that Florian must have gotten up extra early just to see me off. My chest tightened at the thought. I didn't remember having any siblings back on Earth, but if I did, I was sure I'd liked Florian better. Hopefully, I'd be able to bring back a cool pokemon for him to meet.\n\nFor a long moment, I zoned out, watching the the landscape of opulent houses and buildings speed past. Little by little, the sights of the city gave way to a vista of beautiful Lilycove shores, copses of tropical flora dotting the brilliant landscape. In the distance, the looming form of Mt. Pyre stood, dwarfing everything else by comparison.\n\nI wondered if I really could find some ghost pokemon there.\n\n\"Reputation,\" Grandpa scoffed, jerking me from my trance. \"Listen, kid. The Carmine family name wasn't built on kissing ass,\"\n\nThe annoyance in his voice was palpable.\n\n\"It was built on expertise--finesse. Skill.\" He motioned with one hand, flicking his wrist. \"Skill that your father wouldn't know if it smacked him in the face.\"\n\nI winced a little. Grandpa had never made much of an effort to hide his disdain for my father-- his own son, which likely contributed to Father's grumpy-old-bastard behavior. Ultimately, Father always put the good of the family first- and though he could afford to be a bit nicer about it, it wasn't like he was downright cruel, either.\n\n\"You just focus on yourself, kid. Become someone that you can be proud of. As long as you're happy, that's what counts. Anyone who has an issue with my granddaughter can take it up with me.\" He smirked back at me, giving me a thumbs up.\n\n\"Grandpa-the road!\" I panicked as we swerved for a moment, eliciting a honk from a vehicle in the lane opposite to us.\n\nGrandpa chuckled sheepishly, hurrying to correct the wheel. \"Don't tell your mother about that.\"\n\nI stared at him dubiously for a moment, and sighed. \"Snitches get stitches.\" I smirked.\n\nGrandpa rumbled out a raspy laugh.\n\n\"Atta girl! I knew I taught you right.\"\n\n\"...But seriously. Don't tell your mother.\" He muttered, his face becoming serious for a moment.\n\nDamn. Even Grandpa didn't want to get on her bad side.\n\nWe talked a bit more throughout the drive, discussing my upcoming final year at the Academy. He asked if I was hoping for any pokemon in particular as my first partner, which I denied. Honestly, just thinking about having my own pokemon--any pokemon, made my heart pound with excitement. While I was fuzzy on some of the details of my previous world, I knew that pokemon did not exist there- at least, not in the way they did here. In my old world, pokemon were fictional creatures; only existing in video games and anime. Here, pokemon were very real--and an essential part of everyday life.\n\nIn this world, catching your first pokemon and becoming a trainer was considered a necessary rite of passage before truly becoming an adult. A rite of passage that soon enough I would be undertaking. I swallowed, wiping a bead of nervous sweat from my forehead. I was practically vibrating in my seat with anticipation at this point. Somewhere out there was a pokemon--my pokemon, waiting for me to find them.\n\nI felt a seed of anxiety take root within me. Would I be good enough to be their trainer?\n\nI quickly pushed the thought away-- those kinds of thoughts did not serve me. 'There's a pokemon out there for everyone' was a common expression in this world for a reason. Plus, given the sheer diversity and abundance of pokemon, I had no real reason not to be optimistic. It would all work out in the end, I assured myself.\n\n\"Wont be long now. We're almost there,\" Grandpa said, perhaps noticing my mounting anticipation.\n\nWe talked a bit more, before reaching a natural lull in our conversation. We fell into a companionable silence for the rest of the drive.\n\n---------\n\nAfter making our way through airport security, we were greeted by a steward who sent out a Machop to help with my luggage. It felt a bit unnecessary, as I only had but one suitcase and a small backpack, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't grateful to be spared a few extra moments to say my goodbyes. I was really going to miss the old geezer. Asides from Florian, Grandpa was the only person here who I felt ever really believed in me.\n\n\"Make sure to call me, and your parents when you get there,\" Grandpa said, scratching his white, fluffy beard. \"I suppose its a little late to ask, but you're sure you've got everything, right?\"\n\n\"I'm sure, Gramps. Mom wouldn't let me live it down if I forgot anything important.\" I sighed, clutching my carry-on bag.\n\n\"You've got that right,\" He chuckled, and made an exaggerated, terrified expression. I mimicked while comically clutching my chest and mouthing the words, \"The horror!\"\n\nBehind me, a woman cleared her throat. I ceased my miming and straightened out, shuffling awkwardly out of the woman's way. Grandpa and I exchanged a glance, before giggling to ourselves once we were sure she was out of earshot.\n\n\"Attention all passengers of the Hoenn-Sinnoh Flight 82, we will begin boarding now. Passengers in the seating rows A through B, please have your tickets ready before you board.\" A stewardess called over the loudspeaker.\n\n\"Looks like that's your cue, kid. C'mere.\" Grandpa said, pulling me into a tight hug. \"I'm proud of you, Pep. I know you'll do great things out there.\"\n\nI squeezed back. \"Thanks Grandpa. I love you.\"\n\n\"I love you too, bean-sprout.\" He released his grip, giving me a gentle push- and a wink. \"Show those Sinnoh brats what-for.\"\n\n\"You got it!\" I flashed him my cheesiest grin and gave a thumbs up, before making my way to the gate, fumbling for the tickets in my pocket. Panicking for a half second, I turned behind me to see Grandpa still standing there, staring at me with a quirked brow, as if to say, \"You better not have lost them.\"\n\n\"Just kidding!\" I stuck out my tongue, revealing my tickets. He rolled his eyes and snorted. \"Get out of here already!\" He shouted back.\n\nTurning my attention back towards the stewardess's desk, I realized the woman at the desk had seen my childish display. I cleared my throat and handed her my tickets, my face flushed with embarrassment.\n\n\"Enjoy your flight, miss.\" she said with a smirk.\n\n\"You too,\" I replied, internally facepalming as I entered the gate. Nice one, Pep. Real smooth.\n\n---\n\nThe long flight had-so far- been uneventful. I had hoped to be seated a bit closer to the front of the plane, but truthfully I was just grateful to have gotten a window seat. I had watched from the window as Hoenn disappeared beneath me, and an endless sea of clouds now spanned the horizon as far as I could see. I had seen a few Swablu and Altaria soaring through the clouds earlier, but I supposed that our current altitude might be a little too high up, even for them.\n\nI silently wondered if any pokemon could actually live this high up. I seemed to recall that there had been legendary and mythical pokemon that lived in outer space, at least there were in the Pokemon games from my last life- but I couldn't quite remember their names. Images of a green serpent jetting through the clouds popped into my mind. \"Rayquaza, was it?\" I muttered.\n\n\"I sure hope not.\" I jerked as the woman next to me spoke.\n\nI had made little note of my seat-neighbor upon being seated, but now that I really looked at her, I realized that she was beautiful. The woman appeared to be in her mid-to-late thirties, sporting a mop of thick, fluffy brown hair. She wore a thick, fur-trimmed jacket- which sported a pattern reminiscent of a stony cliff-face. Matching clothing to your preferred pokemon type wasn't uncommon- even if a little on the nose. Advertising what pokemon you're going to use could be counter-intuitive in battles, but confident trainers often liked to show off- and this woman did have a certain air of confidence about her. Judging by her outfit, I would have speculated her to be a rock or ground type trainer.\n\n\"What do you know of Rayquaza, girl?\" The woman's brown eyes narrowed at me.\n\n\"I-uh,\" I stammered. \"Not much really. I've just heard stories.\"\n\n\"Hey, relax. You're not in trouble, kid.\" The woman laughed, her expression relaxing. \"Are you a student?\" She asked.\n\n\"Yeah- er, yes ma'am.\" I replied, fidgeting with the buttons on my corduroy jacket. \"I'm transferring to the Jubilife Trainer Academy for my final year.\"\n\n\"Ho? Why so far away?\" She asked, looking puzzled.\n\n\"Its supposed to be the best of the best,\" I replied. \"At least that's what I've heard from my parents.\"\n\nI knew the real reason, though. At best, I would do well, and potentially make a name for the Carmine family in Sinnoh. At worst, well-- at least I would be far away enough from home that it wouldn't embarrass my parents too much.\n\nThe woman pursed her lips for a moment. \"I see. Well, they wouldn't be wrong about that.\"\n\nAn awkward silence set in, and I felt myself zone out again as my eyes drifted back towards the window. After a few moments, the woman spoke again. \"Rayquaza does exist, by the way.\"\n\n\"...Huh?\" I replied, coming out of my daze.\n\n\"Rayquaza,\" she started. \"It isn't just a story. It exists.\"\n\nReally? There really was a forty-foot giant sky serpent out there? Color me interested.\n\n\"Really? How do you know?\" I turned, giving the woman my full attention. \"Have you seen it?\"\n\n\"Simmer down,\" the woman laughed. \"And no- to answer your question- I've not seen it myself, but there are people who have.\"\n\n\"I guess it wouldn't really be a legendary if you could see one so casually.\" I mused.\n\n\"Yes, but- who knows? You might get to see it one day, if you're lucky.\" The woman smiled.\n\nI could certainly hope so- or rather, maybe I shouldn't hope to see a giant space dragon, capable of leveling cities on a whim. That generally wouldn't be something a normal person would hope for. Dragons are just objectively awesome, though. What would it be like to capture such a beast? To ride it into the heavens? I sighed dreamily at the thought.\n\n---------\n\nI waved good-bye to the woman from earlier as I made my way through the terminal. I had been instructed prior to my flight to wait at baggage claim for someone from the Academy to collect me. After retrieving my luggage, I tentatively scanned my surroundings, but didn't see anyone that seemed to be waiting. I sat down on one of the benches, attempting to pull my gangly legs in closer so as not to obstruct traffic.\n\nI waited for about ten minutes before being approached by a girl in what looked to be a Japanese school uniform. She wore a long white skirt that went down to her shins, and dark navy stockings underneath. Admittedly, the uniform was very cute--and tasteful I might add-- but I couldn't help but hope that I wouldn't be forced to wear a skirt.\n\n\"Excuse me, are you Peppa Carmine?\" she asked, tucking a lock of jet-black hair behind her ear.\n\n\"That's me,\" I replied, rising to my feet.\n\nThe girl stiffened for a moment as I towered over her. I gave her a smile, trying my best to not look intimidating. (Which rarely worked.) \"Er, you are?\" I asked.\n\n\"Beatrice. I'm here to take you to the dorms,\" the girl spoke with clear composure. If she was intimidated, she definitely wasn't showing it now. \"Please, follow me.\"",

            "content": "I followed behind Beatrice silently, taking in the unfamiliar sights of Jubilife City. The sun had long since set by now, but the city remained... bright-- obnoxiously so. What little stars could be seen in the sky were all but choked out by a thick blanket of light pollution. Lilycove City had by no means been small, but Jubilife easily dwarfed it by comparison. This city was big.\n\nOn our way we had passed a large building with a comically massive TV screen mounted on its front-- displaying the current time and weather conditions. Despite it being rather late, the streets were bustling with traffic; absolutely teeming with people and pokemon alike. More than once I had been stopped by someone offering me 'the deal of a lifetime', but Beatrice quickly shut that down and continued to hurry me along.\n\n\"Don't make eye contact with them. Just keep walking.\" She told me. I gave her a nod.\n\n\"Is it always like this?\" I asked.\n\n\"Here? Yes.\" she sighed. \"You'll get used to it.\"\n\nWe continued walking, ignoring the street vendors along the way-- which admittedly felt a teensy bit rude, but only the first few times. After the fifth or sixth person attempted to flag us down, I happily threw my manners to the wayside. Being annoying seemed like a common business practice here.\n\nHopefully I wouldn't be spending too much time here, apart from my stay at the Academy. While I could admit that the city itself was impressive, crowds had always made me anxious-- and the pushy street vendors certainly didn't help. Everywhere I looked, the buildings seemed to close in around me. I found my vision rapidly focusing into a tunnel with Beatrice at its center. She continued to walk ahead of me with her head held high, seemingly unbothered by the cacophony of stimuli that pelted us from all sides. I willed myself to hold it together-- Perhaps she was right, maybe I would get used to this-- though I seriously doubted it.\n\n------\n\nI shivered as I stared up and the hulking building before me. The Jubilife Trainer Academy cut an imposing figure, even among the rest of the cityscape. It wasn't just big, but it was ornate--featuring chiseled stone columns along the entranceway, among other impressive feats of architecture. The courtyard was decorated with a brilliant display of meticulously trimmed hedges and shrubbery, which coalesced around an impressively large fountain that featured a statue of a familiar pokemon at its center- A Lucario, if I wasn't mistaken. The Lucario was positioned in a triumphant stance, as if challenging any who opposed it. The rest of the Academy seemed to exude the same energy.\n\nI clutched my knees, letting my luggage fall to my sides for a moment. The trek through the city had taken more out of me than I realized.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Beatrice asked, stopping in front of me.\n\n\"Yeah- I'm fine,\" I panted, forcing myself to smile up at her. \"Crowds just make me pretty nervous.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Beatrice's eyes lingered on me for a moment, but her face betrayed nothing of what she was thinking.\n\nIf you spot this story on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\n\n\"Let me know when you've regained your bearings.\"\n\n--------\n\nUpon arriving at the dormitory, I asked Beatrice if there was a phone I could use to call my family. She led me to a landline phone, before leaving me with a note that had my dorm number hastily scribbled onto it. I thanked her, but she said nothing in return-- only giving me a polite nod before heading up the stairs. I felt a little bad that the school had sent her halfway across the city to retrieve me. I had honestly expected a teacher or staff member-- someone at least getting paid for such a tedious task. I would have to do something to thank her properly later.\n\nI hobbled awkwardly up the stairs with my luggage, once again stopping to catch my breath upon making it to the third floor. Picking myself up, I hurried down the hall in search of my dorm room, which thankfully didn't take long to find. The siren song of sleep was calling my name.\n\n\"Twenty-four C,\" I muttered, looking at the note. \"Yeah, seems like this is it.\"\n\nI reached out to knock on the door, hesitating for a moment. I hoped I wouldn't be waking my roommate up-- though, they would probably be expecting me. Attempting to swallow my anxiety, I gingerly knocked on the door.\n\nNo response.\n\nI knocked a little louder.\n\nNo response.\n\nA little louder.\n\nStill no response. Maybe my roommate was out?\n\nI didn't want to be rude, but my feet were practically screaming at me by this point-- I was exhausted. I gulped as I tried the knob, which was fortunately unlocked. \"Pardon me,\" I called sheepishly as I cracked the door open. Peering inside, I could clearly see that the lights were on.\n\n\"Er- Hello?\" I called again, opening the door to poke my head further inside. I was met with no response, but someone else definitely lived here. Clothes were strewn about one side of the room, and a cute Chansey doll rested atop disheveled bed. Opposite that, the other side of the room appeared empty, save for a bare mattress. Presumably, that would be my bed.\n\nI once again checked the note and number on the door, confirming that I did, in fact, have the correct room.\n\nOh well. I entered, closing the door behind me. I was just too tired to care.\n\nI immediately plopped myself onto the bare mattress, and the world around me went black.\n\n----\n\nI awoke to the sound of footsteps entering the room, causing me to shoot up. How long was I out?\n\nIn the doorway stood a petite girl with shaggy pink hair. She wore thick, dramatic eye makeup--and a completely deadpan expression.\n\n\"You're awake.\" She spoke, her voice as devoid of emotion as her face. \"You're the transfer student, I take it? I was told you'd be late.\"\n\n\"That's me,\" I yawned, offering a wobbly hand to the girl. \"I'm Peppa. You can call me Pep, though.\"\n\n\"Pep it is then.\" She gave me a dubious look, before shaking my hand. \"I'm Rita. You can call me.... Rita.\"\n\nI laughed nervously. Was that supposed to be a joke?\n\n\"I had some.. family stuff to take care of last night, so I left the lights on. I didn't expect you to crash without even changing clothes, though. Long trip then, yeah?\"\n\n\"All the way from Hoenn,\" I replied, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.\n\n\"Well, as much as I love small talk, we really ought to book it. Our teacher is.. interesting. I'd prefer not to be on her shit-list.\"\n\n\"We're in the same class, then?\"\n\nRita nodded. \"You missed orientation yesterday, so I was told to make sure you got to class today. You mind getting a move-on?\"\n\n\"Ah, right. Sorry.\" I replied, scurrying out of bed. I didn't want her getting into any trouble on my account.\n\nAs I rose, I realized I had been draped with a pink, fuzzy blanket. I turned to look at my new roommate, but got the feeling that she was intentionally avoiding my gaze. I smirked. What a nice girl.\n\nAfter a quick rinse in the shower, I donned my favorite outfit- My signature corduroy jacket, a cute Gulpin t-shirt, and some light-denim jeans. Tying the ensemble together was my trusty pair of (slightly scuffed) steel-toed boots. Fiddling with my bangs for a moment, I gave myself a quick once-over in the mirror, decidedly pleased with myself-- I was ready to go.",

            "content": "As Rita and I made our way down the hall, I couldn't help but notice that the sea of students seemed to part to let us through. Despite my best efforts to keep my eyes down, I couldn't help but feel the stares of our fellow peers pelting us from all sides.\n\nI swallowed, feeling a lump of anxiety forming in my throat. This was the prestigious Jubilife Academy-- surely transfer students weren't so uncommon as to illicit this amount of attention?\n\nBattling my nerves, I raised my head as I continued to shuffle through the crowded hallway, following behind Rita closely. Some students whispered as we passed, giving furtive glances -- or straight up scowls -- in our general direction. While the student's gazes seemed to hang on me just for a moment, it was clear to see that the majority of them had their eyes fixed on Rita.\n\nI internally facepalmed at my own self-absorption; feeling a wave of relief-- and then concern-- wash over me. On one hand, I was glad that I wasn't somehow already the object of their ire; but I couldn't help but wonder what their beef with Rita was about. She seemed nice enough to me, even if a bit standoffish.\n\nUpon entering the classroom, I was greeted by an elderly woman who introduced herself as Mrs. Briar, and explained that she was the substitute teacher for the day. Apparently, the class's regular homeroom teacher was out sick. She pointed me to my seat, which happened to be smack in the middle of the classroom. No protagonist window seat for me, I mused. That spot appeared to be taken by Rita, who stared out the window with an uninterested look on her face. I couldn't help but internally chuckle to myself about how well that spot suited her, on account of all the brooding.\n\nDespite Rita's insistence that we 'book it' to class, it seemed that we had been rather early, since we were among the first few students to take our seats. I yawned, watching as others steadily gathered in the classroom, taking their seats and engaging in small talk with their peers. A rather portly boy took his seat next to me, giving me a friendly smile as he sat down.\n\nSupport the creativity of authors by visiting Royal Road for this novel and more.\n\n\"I haven't seen you around before,\" the boy spoke.\n\n\"Yeah, uh. I just got in last night. I'm new here.\"\n\n\"Well hello, new here. I'm Tom.\" He grinned.\n\nI gave a playful scoff. \"Interesting choice for a first impression, Tom.\"\n\n\"What can I say? It's a gift. So, do you have a name or--?\"\n\n\"Peppa. I prefer Pep though.\"\n\n\"Well, it's nice to meet you, Pep.\"\n\nTom and I chatted for a bit before class started. Fortunately for me, Mrs. Briar graciously allowed me to skip over the whole \"transfer-student-introduction\" bit, (Arceus bless her,) and instead opted to get right down to business.\n\n\"Now, as I'm sure you're all aware, it is customary that students in their final year be given their first partner Pokémon,\" Mrs. Briar paced as she spoke. \"But today, we will be going over some basic information you need to know before you can take that first step.\"\n\n\"Jubilife Academy is known for its rather.. Unique approach in teaching these skills. While most schools may focus on written curriculum, we believe that hands-on experience is what truly makes a difference in our student's futures.\" Mrs. Briar turned on her heel and stopped. \"Which is why we will not be giving you a Pokémon.\"\n\nAn air of shock and confusion filled the room as Mrs. Briar paused. Her gaze seemed to sweep across the room, giving each of us a hard glance.\n\n\"You will be capturing your first partner yourselves.\" She gave a shrewd smile. Puzzled looks shot around the classroom, but before anyone could raise any questions, Mrs. Briar continued.\n\n\"Now-- I'm sure you're all wondering how you're going to be capturing a wild Pokémon without already having a partner Pokémon to keep you safe; and you'd be right to ask that question. The answer is simple: It won't be safe. But you'll find out more from your homeroom teacher tomorrow.\"\n\nI swallowed. I'm going to be meeting my partner Pokémon tomorrow.",

            "content": "After Mrs. Briar's lecture, the rest of the morning classes were a bit uneventful. We received basic refreshers in most courses, before being let out for lunch. Tom offered to show me to the cafeteria-- which I happily took him up on, as Rita seemed to disappear the moment the bell rang. It seems like she's just always in a rush.\n\n\"So, you said you're from Hoenn?\" Tom asked, as a woman behind the counter made his plate.\n\n\"Mhm. Lilycove City, actually.\"\n\n\"That's where all the big Pokémon contests happen, right?\"\n\n\"Well, in Hoenn, sure-- but Jubilife's contests are probably bigger.\"\n\n\"Well yeah, I guess you're right. It's just that Jubilife has so much else going on that I kind of forgot about that. I think most people here are all about the battles these days, though.\"\n\n\"Yeah, the city seems... Kind of intense.\"\n\nTom chuckled. \"You'll get used to it.\"\n\nI still don't believe that, but I do appreciate the attempt at reassurance, Tom.\n\nThe line moved forward, and I was given a tray of surprisingly good-looking food. Our lunch consisted of a salad, freshly cut fruits, and an egg salad sandwich. Simple-- but from what I recalled of school lunches in my previous life, I was always happy to receive something that actually resembled food.\n\nAs I expected from a world where all of the animals are relatively sapient, most people opted to be vegetarian. That isn't to say that people didn't eat meat, but it was much less common here. I personally had no qualms about this, as the thought of befriending and raising some Pokémon, only to turn around and eat others, didn't sit quite right with me.\n\nBreaking away from the lunch line, I looked across the crowded cafeteria. Despite most of the tables being packed, there seemed to be an empty swathe cut right through the middle, where a familiar figure sat at a lone, empty table.\n\n\"Do you know her?\" Tom asked, perhaps noticing the concern on my face.\n\n\"Not really, but she's my roommate. We just met this morning.\"\n\n\"And she didn't bite your head off?\"\n\nI frowned. \"No? She was actually pretty nice.\"\n\nTom's eyes widened, but before he could say anything, I started heading towards the empty table. \"I'll see you later, Tom.\" I called, my voice slightly straining above the cacophony of conversations taking place.\n\n\"Oh wow. This is actually pretty good,\" I said, swallowing a bite of my sandwich.\n\nRita blinked at me, her face void of any discernable expression. \"Do you.. need something from me?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"I'm asking what you want.\"\n\n\"I just want to eat my lunch,\" I replied, taking a swig of my little carton of milk.\n\nRita's eyes narrowed. \"You don't have to follow me everywhere, you know.\"\n\nI paused. \"I'm sorry if I'm bothering you. I could leave if you want. I just.. Didn't like seeing you eating by yourself.\"\n\nReading on this site? This novel is published elsewhere. Support the author by seeking out the original.\n\n\"Oh. So that's what this is.\" Rita stood up. \"Well, you can consider your good deed for the day done then.\"\n\n\"Wait--\" I stammered, \"I didn't mean it like--\"\n\n\"I don't want your pity, okay? Just.. Mind your own business.\" Rita sighed.\n\nBefore I could say anything else, Rita stormed off, leaving me alone at the table.\n\nShit. That could have gone better.\n\nWith Rita gone, the table felt like an island, surrounded by an ocean of prying eyes from all angles. As good as the food was, I doubted I could continue eating now. I wondered if this was how she felt, before I came traipsing in like a white-knight. I'm such an asshole.\n\nThe rest of the day dragged on, though I struggled to pay attention to much. I replayed the conversation with Rita in my head over and over, internally reprimanding myself. Nobody likes to feel pitied. I begrudged my own social ineptitude.\n\nI walked slowly on my way back to the dorms, mentally rehearsing how I would apologize to Rita when I got there. By now the sun had already begun to set; golden light dappled the courtyard through a canopy of carefully pruned trees. My eyes followed a couple of Starly flying off into the horizon. I wonder if I'll get capture one while I'm here, I wondered.\n\nReally, any Pokémon would be fine, as long as they were okay with having me as a trainer. My stomach churned with a combination of nerves and excitement. What kind of trainer would I get to be?\n\n\"Pardon me, Peppa.\" a familiar voice called, snapping me from my thoughts. Beatrice stood before me, fixing the cuffs of her sleeves.\n\n\"Oh, Hi Beatrice. Thanks again for last night.\" I chuckled nervously as I looked down at her.\n\n\"It was no trouble. Do you have a moment? There's something I wanted to speak with you about.\"\n\n\"Um, sure-\" I stammered. \"I'm not already in trouble though, am I?\"\n\n\"No, not at all. Walk with me, please.\"\n\nI did my best to keep my composure as I followed beside her. Despite her diminutive stature, Beatrice cut a rather imposing figure. She stood perfectly straight, spoke eloquently, and overall seemed to exude an air of importance.\n\n\"I couldn't help but notice you in the cafeteria today.\" She spoke without looking at me.\n\nGreat, she saw me make an ass of myself.\n\n\"Not that it's any of my business, but you may want to be careful with who you decide to associate with.\"\n\nI paused for a moment, but kept walking. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'm referring to Rita Joy,\" she started, flipping her long hair away from her face as she walked. \"I'm afraid not much good came come of associating with her.\"\n\n\"Okay, this is getting ridiculous. What is everyone's deal? Because it seems like bullying.\"\n\n\"I can see why you'd think that, but Rita is.. Well, an interesting case. She gets nearly perfect grades, never misses classes, and is from a prestigious family. You could call her a model student.\"\n\n\"So, what's the problem?\" I asked, growing impatient.\n\n\"All of this is precisely why it came as a shock when she suddenly attacked a student last year.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks. \"That.. doesn't sound right.\" I may have just met Rita this morning, but she didn't seem like the violent type to me.\n\n\"I don't know the exact details of what happened, but another student was hospitalized last year after getting into a fight with her. There were a few witnesses who attested to seeing Rita attack the girl without any provocation.\"\n\n\"I... see.\" I paused. \"Why are you telling me all of this?\"\n\n\"I was advised to warn you. As the future heiress of the Carmine family, it would serve you well to choose your friends carefully, after all.\"\n\nI swallowed hard-- I did not like where this was going.\n\n\"How did you know that?\"\n\n\"Surely you didn't think the Academy would have sent an escort for just anyone?\"\n\nBeatrice blinked at me, and then laughed. \"You are interesting, Peppa.\"\n\nI looked down at her, unable to find anything to say in response.\n\n\"Mind you, I know that she's you're roommate, but it wouldn't hurt to exercise caution. People like us have too much at stake to risk being dragged down before our careers even have a chance to start.\"\n\n\"People like us?\" My tone betrayed a hint of bitterness that surprised me when I spoke. Calm down, Pep.\n\n\"Please, you understand.\" Beatrice smiled.\n\n\"I actually don't--\"\n\nBefore I could finish that sentence, Beatrice clapped her hands together, cutting me off entirely.\n\n\"Well, it was lovely chatting with you, Peppa. I'm looking forward to seeing how you fare tomorrow.\"\n\nI watched Beatrice's back as she strode off, bile rising in my throat. I didn't have much choice in coming to Sinnoh for my final year, but I chose not to put up a fight in hopes it might get me away from all of the social politics surrounding my family-- a naive thought, in hindsight. There really was no way of escaping my father's scrutiny, it seemed.\n\nI sighed, pushing away the thought. Dwelling on this now wasn't going to help. Whatever the old man had in store for me, I would just have to deal with it as it came. Moreover, what did Beatrice mean by 'how I fare' tomorrow? Was she referring to what Mrs. Briar said about catching our own partner Pokémon?",

I think it'd be better for her to be able to showcase her experiance being raised by business savvy parents in small ways. Remember, she didn't just appear in this world. She was raised in it as the daughter of rich and influential parents for 17 years. She should know skills and techniques affuencial society likes to teach their kids. That means she probably knows at least one instrument, that she can speak at least one more language of that exists in your version of the Pokemon world, that she can understand people with personalities similar to her parents (she's lived with them for 17 years - if she's not been disowned then she knows how to work with these people), and that she's should probably be at least a little spoiled. You've got to think of your character as the culmination of her experiances - with the more immediate being more influential. The last 17 years should have more of an affect on her than her previous life where she was sick for most of it, albeit her previous life should obviously still affect her.\n\nHere, as an example: Her last parents were distant and her new ones demand a certain standard for their affection. Therefore - she is probably eager to prove herself as competent to the people around her.\n\nAnother: Unless she was around people who have less money she might not even know what the standard income level is. With her living in luxury for 17 years she would probably be confused about what is considered expensive.\n\nOne more: Her parents are rich and infleuncial. Therefore there is a chance she is distrustful of people who want to get close to her. People have probably wanted to be friends with her due to wealth and family instead of for her herself. She is much less likely to fall for schemes involving this as someone who is nearly an adult - if someone hasn't tried this on her already then she nows someone who has.\n\nA natural consiquence of this is that most people are nice to her and that she hasn't experianced severe bullying. The teachers and staff are going to step in out of fear of her parents and kids are less inclined to be mean since they want her favor. The most she would experiance is another rich girl getting katty and pushing her around a little or being isolated by other rich kids meaning her friends would be mostly middle to middle-high income.",

The point of my critism is that this is the kind of thinking that you should do if you want a beleivable character with 17 years on the planet before the story starts.\n\nA good exersize might be to accurately descibe who your character is with as few words as possible and then use that to create their history. You can then use that history to inform your characters choices which would help a lot.

With her living in luxury for 17 years she would probably be confused about what is considered expensive.\n\nOne more: Her parents are rich and infleuncial. Therefore there is a chance she is distrustful of people who want to get close to her. People have probably wanted to be friends with her due to wealth and family instead of for her herself. She is much less likely to fall for schemes involving this as someone who is nearly an adult - if someone hasn't tried this on her already then she nows someone who has.\n\nA natural consiquence of this is that most people are nice to her and that she hasn't experianced severe bullying. The teachers and staff are going to step in out of fear of her parents and kids are less inclined to be mean since they want her favor. The most she would experiance is another rich girl getting katty and pushing her around a little or being isolated by other rich kids meaning her friends would be mostly middle to middle-high income.",

The point of my critism is that this is the kind of thinking that you should do if you want a beleivable character with 17 years on the planet before the story starts.\n\nA good exersize might be to accurately descibe who your character is with as few words as possible and then use that to create their history. You can then use that history to inform your characters choices which would help a lot. It would also help a lot to remind you who is who while writing so that characters don't seem to morph illogically between chapters.",

The MC being surprised is understandable, she's only here for the final year but the other students? They should be excited or expecting it all, not surprised.\n\nUnless of course it's the first time they're doing a capture instead of a gifting in which case the wording should be changed to \"this year we're doing things differently cause we believe practical experience is important\" which would be a surprise.\n\nAs for the MC, they're mentally older than 17. It's perfectly fine to be childish and playful cause body age, but at the same time being able to recognise other 17 year olds as kids as compared to her should be noted. Of course that's a very difficult thing to balance so don't worry to much about it, my only advice is that don't let the MC come down to the same level as her classmates. No worries if she's acting like a 17 year old, as long as she sees the bigger picture.",

            "content": "I fiddled with my pencil, waiting for class to begin. Rita hadn't been home last night when I made it back to the dorm, but she had been the first to arrive to the classroom this morning. I had considered approaching her to apologize for yesterday's blunder, but decided now probably wasn't the best time. Other students had begun to pile in, and I didn't want to risk the possibility of turning it into a spectacle. There was no point in apologizing if I just ended up making her feel uncomfortable in the process.\n\nI yawned, tears forming in my eyes. Between the guilt I felt about yesterday, and excitement at the prospect of finally meeting my first partner Pokémon, finding any sort of meaningful sleep had been a fruitless effort.\n\nToday was finally the day, after all. The past seventeen years of my new life had been leading up to now.\n\n\"So how was your first day yesterday, Pep?\"\n\nI jumped as Tom spoke. I hadn't even heard him sit down.\n\n\"Well, uh. It was good, I guess.\" I lied.\n\n\"I'm sorry if I startled you. You looked a million miles away there. Are you settling in okay?\" Tom's hazel-green eyes shone with concern.\n\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\n\"Well, I mean. Just asking. Is the.. dorm okay?\"\n\nI frowned, grasping the double-meaning of his question.\n\n\"I just wanted to see if you were doing okay is all. You know, because..\" Tom's gaze flicked towards the window and back to me.\n\nBecause of Rita's supposed violent reputation.\n\n\"Its fine.\" I huffed, dropping my head into my arms. \"I made an ass of myself yesterday, though.\"\n\n\"Really? What happ-\"\n\n\"ALRIGHT, LISTEN UP KIDDOS.\" A woman's voice boomed over the din of classroom chatter, squashing it completely.\n\nA tall woman with a commanding presence strode through the classroom, taking her place at the forefront.\n\n\"We've got a lot to get through so I'll keep introductions short. My name is Vivienne Kimber, and I will be your teacher for all things Pokémon this year.\"\n\nThis story has been unlawfully obtained without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.\n\nThe woman, Ms. Kimber- sported a thick mop of brown, curly hair, and piercing brown eyes. She wore a rugged, oversized jacket that featured a pattern reminiscent of a stony cliff face-\n\nWait a second.\n\n\"Now, as you all heard from Mrs. Briar yesterday, you will be capturing your first Pokémon today. As she may have informed you, our approach here at Jubilife Academy is a bit different than what you would normally expect.\"\n\nMy eyes widened in recognition. This was the same lady from the plane.\n\n\"Normally, you would just be given a Pokémon, right? Not here. You need to earn your Pokémon, just as you need to earn your place here. We aren't the best of the best for nothing, and we sure as heck aren't going to let you take it easy. I know you're all excited to meet your first Pokémon, but this isn't going to be a walk in the park. I expect you all to take this very seriously.\"\n\nA few students shuffled uncomfortably.\n\n\"Don't think of this just as an important milestone, but also a critically important exam. As such, you will be graded on your performance. Make sure you all listen closely, this is a test you definitely want to pass.\"\n\n\"What will happen if we fail?\" A girl asked from behind me.\n\n\"Failure to successfully capture your first Pokémon will result in expulsion.\"\n\nThe severity of her statement had been punctuated by a nearly collective gasp. All around the room jaws dropped and eyes widened. There were a few panicked exclamations and students attempting to ask questions, but they went ignored as Ms. Kimber seemed to relish the panicked response of her students.\n\nOur teacher stood silently for a few moments, a small but unmistakably sinister grin tugging at the corners of her lips. Her eyes seemed to scan over the room, perhaps gauging our individual reactions.\n\nHer eyes lingered on me for just a moment, sending a shiver down my spine. I wondered if she had recognized me.\n\nAfter going through all that I had; being reborn into the world of Pokemon and living out the last seventeen years as a member of the Carmine family-- there was no way I could return home empty-handed. My family's expectations had weighed heavily on me since I came here, but now I found that my own expectations weighed even heavier. Though it was becoming increasingly difficult to recall my previous self, I was certain that the me I had been in the other world would never forgive the present me if I were to let this chance slip by. Graduation from the Academy practically guaranteed a sponsorship once the term ended, which meant this was the best opportunity I would have at becoming a real Pokémon trainer. Getting sponsored meant a monthly stipend among other benefits, which would be critical to supporting and building a team. If I was going to live out my dreams, I quite literally couldn't afford to be stopped here.\n\nI took a deep breath. I wouldn't fail. I couldn't.\n\nLooking over, I noticed that the color had drained completely from Tom's freckled face. Everyone else probably was having thoughts not too dissimilar to my own.\n\n\"Now, I will give you a brief explanation of how you will go about capturing your Pokémon. I will then escort you to the site on Route 204, where we will begin.\"\n\n\"If you have any questions....\"\n\nNumerous hands shot up.\n\n\"..Save them for later.\" Ms. Kimber coughed. \"Like I said, we have a lot to get through.\"",

            "content": "The tense, nervous energy that had taken hold of our class had given way to tired, agitated grumblings as we shuffled along towards our destination.\n\nMs. Kimber checked over her shoulder periodically, ensuring we hadn't lost anyone on our trek. At this point, we had walked for what felt like miles. The paved roads of the city had long since given way to the dirt and gravel pathways of Route 204.\n\nI looked up, wiping a bead of sweat from my brow. By now, the sun was beating down on us from above. Judging from its position, it looked to be about noon.\n\nBefore setting off, Ms. Kimber had given us a brief rundown of what we were to expect. Upon arriving at our destination, we would be given our Pokeballs, along with some basic supplies. We would then set off on our own, and attempt to catch our first Pokémon ourselves-- much how the people of Ancient Hisui once did. We would then have until sundown to return to the meeting point with a captured Pokémon.\n\nApparently the Academy had been known as the \"Jubilife Survey Corps\" long ago, and took immense pride in that legacy. Back when people feared Pokémon as unstoppable forces of nature, the members of the Survey Corps were among the first to pave the way to partnership between Pokémon and people-- hence the significance of catching a Pokémon with our own two hands. The people of ancient Hisui hadn't had the luxury of being provided with Pokémon to keep them safe, and neither would we-- At least, that was what we had been told. In the modern age, sending a bunch of teenagers out into the wilderness without their own Pokémon would be immensely frowned upon, (if not outright illegal), but I was certain that the Academy must have some way of ensuring our safety. If not, I doubted that the most prominent and prestigious families would have been sending their children here for generations.\n\nMy eyes followed a couple of Jumpluff that lazily floated through the sky over head, before I promptly smacked into the person walking ahead of me.\n\n\"Watch where you're going!\" A short girl with blonde ringlet-curls snapped, turning to look at me. She stiffened when she looked up and saw me looming over her.\n\n\"Ah, uh. I'm sorry.\" I looked down with a weak smile. \"Are we stopping?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Looks like it. I can't see much ahead though.\" She huffed.\n\nI craned my neck to look over the throng of students. Past the wall of bodies, I was able to make out a shimmering dome-shaped structure among the surrounding forest.\n\n\"Alright everyone, pile in!\" Ms. Kimber called over the crowd.\n\nAs we made our way towards the strange, iridescent dome, we were greeted by a couple of Kadabra-- each holding out a spoon respectively. Their eyes beamed with bright purple light as the duo raised their spoons high. With a mystical shing, an opening formed in the dome-- large enough for everyone to enter.\n\n\"Thankyou, Kadabra.\" Ms. Kimber addressed the two, but they did not respond as they continued to hold their spoons high. Just as the whole class had shuffled in, the opening in the dome sealed itself behind us.\n\nYou might be reading a pirated copy. Look for the official release to support the author.\n\nI stood stock-still in amazement, marveling at the shimmering construct that encompassed an entire expanse of forest around us.\n\nIs this.. a move? I don't remember any moves like this.\n\nWait a second. Could it be reflect? Or light screen?\n\nI approached the wall of the dome, where we had just entered. Pressing my hand against it, I found that any force exerted against it rebounded backwards. I tried to push with a bit more pressure, but my hand was sent flying back with ease.\n\nIt must be Reflect then. But, it shouldn't be this strong. This type of scale should be impossible. How is this possible?\n\n\"Something wrong?\" Tom approached from behind me.\n\nHe was dripping sweat and panting slightly-- the walk here, especially with the heat, must have been rough on him. Looking around, most of my classmates seemed to be in a similar state. I was thankful to be faring a little better, even if not by much. I silently thanked God, or Arceus-- or whoever, for giving me such a strong body this time. I didn't like to think about it, but I knew that I hadn't been so lucky before.\n\n\"Oh, Yeah! Um, sorry.\" I coughed. \"I was just wondering what this is-- or how its even possible.\" I gestured towards the wall.\n\n\"That would be a barrier.\" A woman wearing a lab coat approached us, holding a clipboard. \"Not to be confused with the move barrier. This is actually a highly advanced application of a couple of moves commonly known by Psychic type Pokémon.\"\n\n\"But.. How is it so big?\"\n\nThe researcher beamed. \"I'm glad you asked! We actually have a few dozen different-\"\n\n\"I see you've met one of our on-site researchers.\" Ms. Kimber interrupted, placing her hand on the woman's shoulder. The researcher froze.\n\n\"Don't worry kids, there will be plenty of time for questions later-- but we're on a tight schedule. Lets keep it moving, yeah?\" Ms. Kimber winked.\n\nThe researcher gave me an apologetic look, before sheepishly returning to her work.\n\nI internally bristled. I really wanted to know, damn it!\n\nMs. Kimber led us to a clearing where a handful of tables had been set up. On each of the tables, a few dozen bags had been neatly laid out.\n\n\"Okay everybody, listen up.\" Ms. Kimber cleared her throat as she addressed the throng of expectant students.\n\n\"Each of you will take one bag. Inside each bag, you will find three pokeballs, a pokedex, and some basic supplies. Line up single file and begin.\"\n\nOne by one my classmates stepped forward. When my turn to claim a bag came, I found my hands trembling with anticipation. The bag itself seemed to have been made of high-quality material, and even featured an adjustable over-the-shoulder sling. I stepped out of the line, fiddling with one of the bag's many zippers.\n\nReaching inside, I fished out the Pokedex Ms. Kimber had mentioned. It sort of resembled a flip-phone from my previous world-- one of the bulky ones from the early 2000's. It featured what looked to be a camera lens on the back, most likely intended for scanning pokemon. I pocketed it and continued rummaging through the bag's contents. Inside, I found a couple bottles of water, a small pack containing some berries, and three pokeballs.\n\nTaking out one of the pokeballs, I watched with childlike wonder as the device shrunk down to belt-clip size upon clicking the button at its center. I tapped the button a few more times, watching as it shrunk and grew repeatedly. I had no idea how the mechanics of the pokeball worked, but nonetheless, the technological wonder of the little device was not lost on me.\n\n\"First time seeing a pokeball?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"No, I've seen them. I've just never gotten to hold one.\" I responded. \"I never thought of it before now, but how do you reckon its even possible for a whole pokemon to fit inside this little thing?\"\n\nTom ruffled his sandy-blonde hair for a moment. \"I don't think anyone knows, aside from the people who make them.\" He shrugged.\n\nI marveled at the thing a moment longer before slipping it back into one of the front pockets of the bag for easy access. Soon I would be getting to use it.\n\nA grin spread across my face, and for a moment, all of my prior nerves melted away. My Pokémon was out there, waiting for me to come and find them.\n\nIt wouldn't be long now, and I didn't intend on keeping them waiting.",

            "content": "I tried my best to keep myself alert as Tom and I shuffled through the forest. Light filtered in from above, dappling the leaf-covered forest floor. Some of the trees had begun changing color-- Autumn would be upon us soon. Throughout the forest, the sounds of Pokémon cries echoed, setting me on edge. I gripped the pokeball in my pocket tight as I sidestepped around twigs and loose stones. I needed to keep my footsteps as light as possible-- It wouldn't do to scare off any potential encounters.\n\nMy mind swirled with anxiety--I had to find a pokemon, I needed to. I couldn't afford to fail here. Everything I wanted was riding on this.\n\nJust as I began to spiral, a cracking noise broke me from my thoughts-- above, a Chimchar was playing in the branches of a nearby tree.\n\nWithout thinking, I immediately lobbed the pokeball gripped white-knuckle tight in my hand at the little monkey. To my surprise, the pokeball was right on target-- but my stomach sank as the Chimchar looked down at me with a devious grin. I watched as the little pokemon actually caught the pokeball, and without missing a beat, launched it straight back at me. The metal ball slammed into my forehead with such force that I fell backwards.\n\n\"Augghh! You little shit!\" I growled in frustration as the little monkey pokemon slapped his behind, clearly taunting me. The Chimchar pointed and laughed at me, before swinging away through the dense canopy.\n\n\"Oh, gosh. That looks like it might bruise. Are you okay?\" Tom ran to my side, offering to help me up.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" I grumbled, taking Tom's arm. \"I'll get him next time.\"\n\nI took deep breaths as we continued on in silence. I needed to calm down-- as frustrating as it was, I couldn't afford to lose my cool like that again.\n\n\"So, was that your plan?\" Tom asked over his shoulder as he stepped over a large branch.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I responded, my eyes still searching the canopy for the Chimchar that wounded my pride... and my face.\n\n\"Are you just going to meander around, lobbing pokeballs at the first thing you see?\"\n\nI stopped in my tracks. I hadn't really had a plan to begin with, but since he put it that way, I felt a bit silly.\n\nTom laughed, taking my silence as an affirmative.\n\n\"Hey, don't worry. Thats probably what ninety-percent of the class is planning on doing, too.\"\n\n\"Well, what are you going to do then?\" I huffed, rubbing the forming bump on my forehead. If he had any better ideas, I was all ears.\n\nTom put his hand out, gesturing for me to stop, before placing a finger to his lips in a shushing motion.\n\n\"You hear that?\" He grinned. \"We're getting close.\"\n\nI listened for what he was talking about, but all I could hear was the sound of Pokemon calls and leaves rustling in the wind.\n\n\"Uh... close to what, exactly?\"\n\n\"Water. Running water.\" His grin grew cartoonishly. \"Thats my plan.\"\n\n\"Okay?\" I shrugged.\n\nTom sighed upon seeing my confusion. \"Water means water-type Pokemon. Running water means safe drinking water. Which means even more Pokémon.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" My cheeks flushed. \"That... does sound like a good place to start.\"\n\nOf course, Pokemon would need to drink somewhere. Safe drinking water would create a place where pokemon would naturally gather. I couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed for not thinking of that-- it was certainly a better plan than... well, nothing.\n\nCutting our way through dense underbrush, we soon came across the source of the sounds Tom heard-- a gentle river that flowed straight through the forest. All of my prior frustration melted away as I took in the sight before me-- it was truly breathtaking, like something you'd see on a postcard. The river curved in a soft bend through thick holts of trees; I watched as fallen leaves danced across the water's surface, before making their way down a couple of gently slopping waterfalls just at the river's bend. The spray coming off the waterfalls shimmered in the sun, making small rainbow effects in the light.\n\nStolen novel; please report.\n\nTom sat down beside the river's edge, fiddling with his bag. Looking down, I noted a few shadows moving under the water's surface.\n\nA little ways away, a Magikarp leaped with a splash, flopping back down into the water.\n\n\"Here we go,\" Tom said, retrieving an Oran berry from his bag. He broke the berry in half, before holding it just below the water. \"Its like fishing!\"\n\nI sat down next to him, staring at my reflection in the water. \"Think it will work?\"\n\n\"Eh, probably. Either way, some Pokémon are bound to come here sooner or later. I just hope I don't lose a finger.\"\n\nI gave a sheepish chuckle. \"That would be hard to explain to your parents.\"\n\nFor a moment I could have sworn I saw Tom's cheery expression darken at the mention of his parents, but he didn't say anything more-- and I certainly didn't want to pry. For now I was content to wait in companiable silence. Now that I had calmed down, I had a good opportunity to reassess my strategy.\n\nIt wasn't long before we were greeted by the face of a particularly chubby Goldeen, as it happily snatched the piece of berry from Tom's fingers. He reached out and gave the Goldeen a gentle pat on the head, to which it gave a contented trill in response.\n\n\"Oh would you look at this beauty-- a Goldeen,\" Tom beamed as the pokémon gently nibbled at his fingers. \"Did you like the berry, Goldeen?\"\n\n\"Deeen!\"\n\n\"You can have a little more, but not too much, okay? I don't have very much on me.\"\n\n\"Gol!\" The chunky fish spun in a circle, fanning out her billowing fins in affirmation.\n\nI took out my pokedex, and aimed it at the happily-splashing creature.\n\nWith a beep, its entry popped up immediately, which I read aloud:\n\n\"Goldeen, the Goldfish Pokemon. Goldeen is a water-type pokemon commonly found in rivers, lakes, and ponds. Though Goldeen are generally docile, they are capable of inflicting staggering amounts of damage with the sharp horn on their heads.\"\n\n\"Here, hit that button there-- it should be able to give us specific details on this Goldeen, I think.\" Tom gestured without touching the device, on account of his wet hands.\n\n\"Goldeen, female. Ability: Water Veil.\"\n\nGoldeen eyed my pokedex curiously, perhaps wondering how the little device knew so much about her.\n\n\"Are you going to catch her?\" Excitement bubbled in my chest as Tom fed Goldeen the other half of the oran berry.\n\n\"Well, that depends,\" The boy mused. \"Would you like to come with me, Goldeen? To become a trainer pokemon?\"\n\nThe fish paused for a moment before gulping down the other half of the Oran berry.\n\n\"Gol... Go-ol?\" She stared up, seemingly puzzled.\n\n\"You see, that would mean catching you in this ball,\" Tom held out the Pokeball for Goldeen to see. \"If you came with me, it would mean that we would be partners. Pokemon trainers work with their pokemon and direct them in battle. Does battling sound like something you'd want to do?\"\n\nGoldeen stayed silent for a moment, looking conflicted. \"Eeen...\"\n\n\"Its okay if you aren't sure. You could think about it if you want?\" Tom assured the Pokemon. \"If you do want to come with me though, you'll have to decide before sundown, okay?\"\n\nThe pokemon trilled, as if to say \"I'll consider it,\" before disappearing under the water. Tom watched Goldeen's shadow as she swam away.\n\nTom stared at the water, his face unreadable.\n\nI stared for a few moments, unsure of what to say.\n\n\"...Did you want to catch her?\"\n\n\"Well, sure I did,\" He replied, wiping his hands on his pant-legs. \"but what its not just about what I want. What Goldeen wants is important, too.\"\n\nA wave of realization washed over me. Earlier I had been so eager to lob a pokeball at the first thing I saw, and not once had I ever considered that I should ask the Pokemon what it wanted first. I felt a pit of guilt form in my stomach. No wonder that Chimchar hit me in the face. I wanted to hit myself in the face too, right about now.\n\nAfter a long silence, I let my shoulders slump with a deep sigh.\n\n\"You're a good guy, Tom.\"\n\n\"...I wouldn't say that.\" Tom shrugged. \"I'm just trying to be decent.\"\n\nTom was right. This wasn't a game like it had been in my old world. After seventeen years, I was so sure that I understood that. Pokemon were real-- and alive here. They had thoughts, and wants, and feelings-- and if I hadn't seen Tom's interaction with Goldeen, I could have been someone who callously trampled all over that. If not for Chimchar catching my pokeball, there was a very real possibility that I would have been.\n\nAsking for the Pokémon's consent wasn't something only a good person would do-- it should be common decency. I wanted to be my pokemon's friend, not their captor. What gave me the right to force them to accept me as their trainer?\n\nMaybe that was the point of capturing Pokémon this way; the point of the 'exam' itself. We didn't have the option of weakening a Pokémon and forcing it to join us-- we were supposed to convince it to come with us of its own accord.\n\nI stood up with a start, slapping myself on the cheeks. The sound caused Tom to flinch.\n\nThere was no time left to lose. If I was going to catch a pokemon today, I was going to do it right. If I ended up failing, so be it. All I could do was try my best, and hope that there was a pokemon in this forest content to have me as its trainer. Steeling myself, I slung my bag over my shoulders and across my chest.\n\n\"Umm, Pep?\" Tom stared at me with clear concern. \"You okay?\"\n\n\"Tom, thankyou. I think I'm going to go off on my own now.\"\n\n\"Oh-um. Alright.\" Despite looking confused, Tom gave me a supportive smile. \"Good luck, Pep.\"\n\n\"Thanks. You too, man. I'll see you later.\"\n\n\"Later, then. Be careful out there.\"",

Interesting\n\nEdit\n\nJust remembered, does the psychic barrier prevent bigger/evolved water pokemon like sealing or aggressive ones like basculin? I mean, it's a river, unless the barrier is creating a net at the entrance and exit of the river or there's a pokemon ranger/teacher keeping track of all water pokemon entering/exiting the river it's highly possible for something dangerous to enter and harm a student, especially a student from an influential family.\n\nOn the other hand, you could just say \"oh there's lots of psychic types/cameras keeping track of every student for safety reasons.\n\nOf course all of this could be explained in later chapters so no need to exposition dump this very chapter.",

            "content": "By now the sun had slightly dipped from its peak in the sky; I had estimated it to be around two o'clock in the afternoon. Far above me, the strange psychic dome-construct fainty shimmered in the sunlight. From here it was barely even perceptible-- I had to really squint to see it. I still wondered how the mechanics of it all worked, but decided that now wasn't the time to question it. The clock was ticking.\n\nOn my hike I had encountered a couple of Pokémon, none of which seemed all too pleased to see me. I had only narrowly avoided getting hit with a panicked Oddish's stun spore, before a group of territorial Shinx decided that I had trespassed on their property. Needless to say, I had done quite a bit of running-- by now my feet had long since been throbbing with exertion. Nevertheless, I was grateful to come away from the encounter with only exhaustion, considering it could have been electrical burns.\n\nI stopped to catch my breath at the river's edge-- noticing a couple of Lotad lazily drifting down the river. I shielded my face the second their eyes fell on me, bracing for an attack that thankfully never came. Almost every Pokémon I had come across thus far had attempted to attack me on sight, but fortunately, these Lotad seemed completely indifferent to my presence.\n\nBreathing out a sigh of relief, I decided that maybe this would be a good opportunity. Indifference was much better than aggression, so I figured that perhaps I had a shot at befriending the placid little creatures. Mimicking Tom's strategy, I called out to them--holding out a fresh berry in attempts of grabbing their attention. One of the Lotad peeked its head up, briefly inspecting the berry-- but quickly decided it wasn't interested.\n\n\"Ohoh, you're too good for my berries, then?\" I jokingly huffed at the lily pad creatures, as they continued their lazy commute down the river.\n\nTaking a seat on the grass, I watched for a few moments as the Pokémon floated away. Such pleasant little guys, I thought to myself.\n\nSoon, my attention was ripped away by a loud rumble from my stomach. \"Time for a break, I guess.\" I chuckled.\n\nDubiously, I eyed bright-red berry in my hands. If memory served me correctly, this was a cherri berry. Much like its name implied, it closely resembled a cherry from Earth, except much larger-- about the size of a lemon. I hadn't tried one before, but I'd seen my father's Ninetales gobble them up just fine-- so I figured, why not. At the very least I knew that they weren't toxic-- I'd heard some people used them to season their food. I internally shrugged. In a survival settling, I could probably do a lot worse.\n\nThis text was taken from Royal Road. Help the author by reading the original version there.\n\nI took a bite of the berry-- and immediately wished I hadn't.\n\nIt was hot.\n\nSo hot.\n\nTears welled in my eyes as I coughed the berry out onto the grass. Nothing could have prepared me for how aggressive the taste of this innocuous looking berry would be-- How could anything taste this.... anything. Within moments, the sadistic piece of produce had reduced me to a heaving, sweat-drenched mess.\n\nIt was like biting into a cherry that had been infused with the raw essence of every chili pepper on Earth, dunked repeatedly in sriracha sauce, and then marinated in the full concentrated power of the sun.\n\nEvery tastebud on my tongue seemed to wail in endless, burning torment; I coughed relentlessly as white-hot pain gripped my throat.\n\nI was certain-- nothing could be more anything than this berry was spicy. On the Scoville scale, I would have given in a ten-billion.\n\nI coughed and gagged, tears streaming down my face as I scrambled to empty the contents of my bag. Objects clinked and thudded as they hit the ground, scattering everywhere. I didn't care.\n\nFinally-- my prize hit the grass with a thud. I looked at the water bottle in front of me as if it had descended from the heavens above. Without wasting a second, I snatched up the bottle, uncapping it. Water splashed my face, drenching the front of my shirt as I took greedy gulps between sobs.\n\nIt wasn't enough. Somehow, the flaming, burning hell unleashed in my mouth had only been tamped down slightly-- as if I'd tried using garden hose to put out a forest fire.\n\nI didn't just regret eating this berry. I regretted being born.\n\nPanicking, I desperately searched the scattered pile of supplies for another bottle-- but had no such luck.\n\nThere was little choice now. With a splash, I dunked my head into the blessedly clean looking river, gulping down as much water as I could without choking. I had to go back a couple more times before experiencing any meaningful relief.\n\nThankfully, the pain had finally begun to dull-- though my mouth still felt thoroughly scorched. I had a feeling I wouldn't be tasting anything for a while.\n\nPanting, I flopped myself back onto the grass. For a while, I just laid there, trying to take deep breaths. Then the tears came.\n\n\"I'm an idiot.\" I laughed sardonically. \"I don't have time for this.\"\n\nI forced myself upright, and began to gather my dumped belongings. One by one, I haphazardly thrusted each object back into my bag.\n\n\"Stupid me,\" I crushed the empty water bottle. \"stupid school.\"\n\nSuddenly, my hand touched the partially-eaten berry. I stared down at it hatefully, as the sob I had been stifling bubbled up in my throat.\n\n\"STUPID BERRY!\" I wailed, throwing the wretched fruit as hard as I could.\n\nA couple of moment later, a Pokémon's cry snapped me from my tantrum. I froze as the bushes behind me rustled.",

            "content": "I silently cursed myself for choosing to set off alone. Just an hour ago I had been so confident, and now here I was-- cowering in the dirt.\n\nI half expected whatever magical beast I had unwittingly thrown the berry at to come charging out of the bushes at any moment. Images of gnashing teeth and rending claws filled my mind--In the Pokemon world, it was entirely possible that the creature behind these bushes could probably zap, scorch, or drown me on the spot.\n\nThe bushes shook violently-- sending me scooting backwards as I flinched away; my eyes shut tightly as I feared for the worst.\n\nBut no attack came.\n\nPeeking through my fingers, I slowly turned to look at whatever had popped out of the bushes. Thankfully, the pokemon that emerged hadn't been anything close to the terrifying beast my mind had cooked up. It was... small, among the smallest I'd ever seen. The 'beast' I had been cowering from barely stood at a foot tall, if that. I quickly recognized this pokemon as a wild surskit. All at once I deflated, letting out the breath I had been holding with a deep sigh.\n\nThis was still a pokemon--an anomalous being capable of wielding the forces of nature on a whim--so it went without saying that it wasn't to be underestimated. Even so, I couldn't help but feel relieved. I had seen surskit before, as they were native to Hoenn-- much like myself. (If you didn't count Earth, I suppose.)\n\nThe pokemon's shape was defined by its blue, orb-like body at its center, supported by four spindly legs. On the top of it's head/body, it sported an orange, antennae-like appendage that now skewered my thrown cherri berry. It's face featured two small, beady eyes, with little pink markings underneath that resembled blush. Truthfully, my mind couldn't have conjured a less intimidating image if I had tried. The only word that came to mind upon seeing the disgruntled surskit was, \"Cute.\"\n\n\"Sskit! Surrss! Ssk-Kit!\" The tiny pokémon hissed, it's adorable bug eyes blazing at me with barely contained rage.\n\n\"I-I'm sorry,\" I coughed, suppressing the nervous laughter that threatened to bubble up within my sore throat. \"I promise I didn't mean to hit you with that.\"\n\nThe perturbed little bug drew closer, it's tiny body wobbling under the weight of the berry now stuck to it's head.\n\n\"Suuuursss! SSsskiti-iit!\" It shrieked. I interpreted this as, \"Watch where you're throwing things, you stupid human!\"\n\nThe laughter died in my throat as I once again flinched, but only slightly this time. Instead of attacking, the surskit let out a pitiful cry as it lifted a leg and began furiously rubbing it against its face.\n\n\"Here, let me get that for you.\" I reached for the berry, eliciting a shrill hiss from the bug. Startled, it unleashed a torrent of bubbles from its mouth that stung slightly on impact. I winced under the sudden bombardment, but the attack fortunately left me with no real damage to speak of.\n\nThe cloud of bubbles quickly dissipated, revealing the surskit in clear distress. I looked on in confusion as it desperately rubbed its face into the dirt. \"What is it doing?\"\n\nA gasp escaped me as my eyes once again locked onto the berry stuck to the pokemon's head.\n\n\"The juice! It's in your eyes, isn't it?\"\n\nAll at once, recollections of chopping jalapeños back on Earth flooded my mind. A blurry image of a woman--no, my mother-- reminded me to always wash my hands after handling the spicy peppers, and to never touch my face after chopping them. The image flickered, revealing the child I had once been ignoring her mother's warnings, only to end up with her face under a running faucet minutes later. My head throbbed with a dull ache as I mentally pushed the images away.\n\nMuch like how I once ate jalapeños, a pokemon might have been able to eat a cherri berry without issue-- but that didn't necessarily mean that getting it's juices into their eyes wouldn't hurt like hell. After experiencing the wrath of the cherri berry firsthand, the poor surskit truly had my deepest condolences. I wouldn't have wished that pain upon my worst enemy-- and here I had inflicted it upon an innocent bystander.\n\nGuilt overtook me, swallowing my prior inhibitions-- I needed to fix this somehow.\n\nFind this and other great novels on the author's preferred platform. Support original creators!\n\n\"Please, I just want to help you,\" I pleaded as I inched closer to the flailing pokemon.\n\n\"SSssuurss,\" the Surskit protested, again hissing at me through a face-full of grime.\n\nMy heart sunk further as I watched the poor surskit frantically thrash about in the dirt; it's insectoid legs flailing wildly in the air. The pokemon wailed in distress-- It couldn't seem to dislodge the berry by itself.\n\n\"I did this,\" I admonished myself internally. \"Even if Surskit attacks me, I've got to get that berry off of it.\"\n\nSwallowing, I scooped up the Surskit, fully prepared to take another blast of stinging bubbles to the face. As quickly as I could manage, I plucked the skewered berry off of Surskit's antennae, tossing it onto the grass where it could cause no further harm.\n\nThe pokemon looked up at me for a moment, tears pooling at the edges of it's tiny black eyes. \"Ssskit?\"\n\n\"Its okay, buddy.\" I tried my best to make my voice as low and soothing as possible. \"I'm going to get the juice off of you, now--so please don't shoot me in the face with anything, okay?\"\n\nSurskit gave me a long, hard stare--before surprising me with a strangely person-esque nod. Earlier, I hadn't been sure it even knew what I was saying, but I took this as confirmation that it could understand me just fine.\n\nAs I rose, I carefully cradled the surskit against my chest. Unsurprisingly, the diminutive pokemon seemed to weigh almost nothing at all.\n\n\"Heeere we go,\" I hummed, gently lowering the Pokémon into the river.\n\nInstead of becoming submerged, Surskit stood perfectly still on the water as if it were dry land-- and I quickly set to to my task. Surskit whimpered and shifted slightly in response to my touch, but fortunately gave me no further trouble. Now that the pokemon had calmed down a bit, it allowed me to gently splash it's face with water; keeping it's eyes tightly shut as I wiped away the grime.\n\n\"Surskit, I need you to open your eyes for me, okay?\" I gently cajoled the little bug. \"I promise, it will feel much better when I'm done.\"\n\nThankfully, it didn't seem to take much convincing, as Surskit reluctantly opened one eye a couple of moments later.\n\nI gently scooped water into my hand, carefully pouring it over Surskit's exposed eye.\n\nThe pokemon blinked at me a couple of times, before giving a contented trill.\n\n\"See? That wasn't so bad.\" A small smile tugged at the corners of my lips. \"Are you ready to do the other one?\"\n\n\"Skiiit!\"\n\nWith Surskit's prior apprehension having all but melted away, I had an even easier time of rinsing her eyes-- she now seemed to lean into my touch, even if just a little bit. A dopey grin stretched across my face as I gave the bug a gentle pat on the head. With her mood having improved greatly, the pokemon did a little spin on the water-- happily blowing little bubbles from her mouth.\n\nUnfortunately, just as I began to laugh, my head was again seized by a throbbing, searing pain. I winced, desperately blinking away images of my mother on Earth cajoling me in much the same way I had just done with Surskit.\n\nConcern clouded Surskit's eyes as she paused her celebration. \"Suuurss?\"\n\n\"Ah- don't worry. I'm okay. Here, I've got something for you.\" Giving my head a shake, I pulled my jacket kept wrapped around my waist free, and offered the sleeve to Surskit to dry her face.\n\nSurskit blinked at the jacket, and back at me, as if to say \"What is that for?\"\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appeared that Surskit was already perfectly dry.\n\n\"Oh, that's right. You're a water-type, aren't you?\"\n\nI'd learned in school that water-type pokemon generally weren't effected by water the same way people are. I could only assume that Surskit's body had somehow already absobered the moisture.\n\nSurskit tilted it's head quizzically in response to my question.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess you wouldn't really know how we classify you, huh?\" I laughed, my smile returning. \"Here, let me show you.\"\n\nSettling back down on the grass, I retrieved my pokedex from my pocket.\n\nSurskit's entry read:\n\n\"Surskit -- The Pond Skater Pokemon, a Water/ Bug type. Surskit are commonly known to inhabit freshwater wetlands, such as rivers, lakes, and ponds-- though they are also known to occasionally appear in puddles after rainstorms. Surskit feeds on microscopic, aquatic organisms. The tips of surskit's feet secrete an oil that enables it to walk on water. Similarly, the antennae on it's head can also secrete a sweet-tasting syrup. The scent of said syrup is capable of attracting other wild pokemon.\"\n\nI whistled at the entry. \"You've got all sorts of tricks up your sleeve then, huh?\"\n\nSurskit gave no response-- her gaze seemed entirely fixed on my pokedex.\n\nHitting the button on the side like Tom showed me, I scanned Surskit once again.\n\n\"Surskit -- Juvenile Female. Ability: Swift Swim.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess that means you can swim really fast then? But you don't really seem to...really.. swim..\"\n\nA spindly blue leg tentatively poked at my leg from beside me, causing me to stiffen slightly. My breath caught for a moment as the curious bug stepped carefully over my lap-- I hadn't even heard her approach. Surskit reached one of her tiny feet out, gingerly tapping it against the pokedex's screen.\n\nBlack eyes looked back and forth between me and the screen, sparkling with wonder. \"Suuurss?\"\n\n\"Did you not know you had all of those abilities?\"\n\nSurskit's head shook, gesturing in the negative. \"Skiii! Suuu-uur!\"\n\nI had been under the impression that pokemon were born with the innate knowledge of their species, but I really couldn't be sure. The pokedex did indicate that Surskit was a juvenile, so perhaps she just hadn't grown into all of her powers yet. I wondered if somewhere there were a pair of surskit parents searching for her.\n\nThe familiar ache returned as my mind tore between images of my parents back in Hoenn, and my parents back on Earth.\n\n\"Hey, Surskit? Do you.. have a family?\"",

Like I said earlier, I’m still enjoying the story!",

            "content": "Surskit looked up at me with a confused expression.\n\nIt was common for wild pokemon to live within familial units or communities, but it really depended on the species. From what I had seen in my life so far in the pokemon world, pokemon's social behaviors largely mirrored the Earth counterparts they had been based on. That is to say, pokemon that resembled dogs would be more likely to live in packs- though there were many exceptions to this. I couldn't necessarily say whether or not surskits commonly lived together, because many bug pokemon were also known to lead solo lives straight from hatching. Pokemon like Beedril or Durant would be an obvious exception, though.\n\n\"Are there any other pokemon you live with, Surskit?\" I asked. \"Anyone that would miss you if you were gone?\"\n\nA pained expression crept across her face momentarily, but Surskit blinked before shaking her head in the negative. \"Skkkt.\"\n\n\"Did something happen?\"\n\nThe little bug huffed and jerked her head in response. Whatever had happened, she clearly didn't want to talk about it.\n\n\"I.. see. It must be hard living all by yourself then, huh?\" I swallowed. \"Would you.. like to come with me?\"\n\nSurskit gave me a searching glance, as if wondering what I meant.\n\nI slowly reached for my bag, not making any sudden movements as to startle the bug in my lap. After fishing for a moment, my fingers met the cool metal of my pokeball. I held it out for Surskit to inspect.\n\n\"See, this is a pokeball. If you let me capture you, that means you'll be my first pokemon- my partner.\"\n\n\"Surs?\"\n\nI took a deep breath, tamping down my own excitement. With a slow exhale, I set the pokeball down in the grass beside me.\n\n\"But its okay if you want to stay here, Surskit. Its your choice.\"\n\nThe blue bug stared up at me with wide eyes, and pointed a foot forward at my face. \"Surrsskkiit?\"\n\n\"M-Me? Sorry, I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself.\" I stammered. \"My name is Pep, short for Peppa. I'm an aspiring pokemon trainer.\"\n\n\"Skiit skit!\" Surskit shook her head.\n\n\"Oh, you want to know what a trainer is?\"\n\nA nod.\n\n\"A trainer is someone who works together with pokemon to battle and get stronger. I'm not really a trainer yet, but my goal is to become one-- a good one. I want to be strong, so that I can enter the pokemon league and go on my journey. I want to meet lots of different pokemon, and battle a whole lot of them too!\"\n\nUnauthorized usage: this narrative is on Amazon without the author's consent. Report any sightings.\n\nBlack eyes beamed up at me with excitement. \"Surrss!\"\n\n\"You want to battle?\"\n\n\"Skiit!\" Surskit chirped, pumping a leg in the air.\n\n\"Haha, you're a fiery one huh?\"\n\nThe little bug beamed.\n\n\"Surskit, listen, I- I really like you, and I'd love for you to come with me- but again, the choice is yours. If you need some time to think--\"\n\nAs I spoke, Surskit turned and placed a foot on the pokeball. In an instant, red light exploded in my vision, encompassing everything for a brief moment- before disappearing just as quickly.\n\nThe bug was gone.\n\nMy jaw hung slack in disbelief for a few moments, as I stared wide-eyed at the pokeball before me. With shaking hands I carefully picked up the metal sphere.\n\nI had somehow done it- I had captured my first Pokémon.\n\n\"YESSS!\" I cheered, pumping my fists into the air. A ways off, a flock of bird Pokémon fled from the noise. Whoops.\n\nI flopped back down on the grass, drinking the moment in- no matter how unceremonious it had been. I had succeeded. I was going to be a real pokemon trainer.\n\nI held out Surskit's pokeball.\n\n\"Here goes nothing.\" A toothy grin stretched across my face as I finally lived my childhood dream of calling out my very own, real-life pokemon.\n\n\"Surskit, come on out!\"\n\nIn a flash of red Surskit appeared beside me, fire burning in her eyes.\n\n\"Surss! Surs surskit!\"\n\nI interpreted this as, \"When do I get to battle?\"\n\n\"Easy there tiger,\" I laughed, giving Surskit a gentle pat on the head. \"I guess it was the battles that sold you then, huh?\"\n\n\"Skiit!\"\n\n\"Not my good looks or winning personality?\"\n\nSurskit gave me a sidelong glance.\n\n\"Ouch. But hey- I'm so glad to have you Surskit. We're going to have so much fun together!\" I giggled, scooping the bug up into a hug.\n\nSurskit trilled, spraying my face with a trickle of water in mock protest, but overall seemed content to allow me the moment.\n\nMovement from the bushes snapped me from my giddy thoughts, however, and I felt Surskit's body stiffen against me.\n\n\"Are you done celebrating, then?\" A deadpan voice called from the treeline.\n\n\"Rita?\" I called back. \"How long have you been there?\"\n\n\"Not long,\" Rita replied, emerging from the brush. \"I just happened to hear some idiot out here cheering.\"\n\n\"Ah, yeah. That would be me,\" I grinned sheepishly, feeling my face flush with mild embarrassment.\n\n\"Surssss.\" Surskit growled, breaking from my grasp to step in front of me.\n\n\"Easy there little one,\" Rita crouched down, speaking in a soft tone. \"Its okay.\"\n\nSurskit seemed to calm down, if only just a bit.\n\n\"Surskit, its okay. Rita is a friend.\" I assured her.\n\nHer posture relaxed, but Surskit's eyes remained trained on Rita.\n\n\"Friend is probably a bit much.\" The pink-haired girl rolled her eyes.\n\nI winced. \"Rita, I understand if you're mad about yesterday- I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"No, you just caught me in a bad mood is all. Its fine.\" Rita shrugged, pushing a lock of hair from her face. \"I was going to say you're an acquaintance. Not quite a friend yet, I suppose.\"\n\nA rictus grin spread across my face.\n\n\"Yet?\"\n\n\"Listen, don't push your luck.\" Rita scoffed. \"I see you caught a pokemon then, yeah?\"\n\n\"Yep! I caught Surskit just now- well, she kind of caught herself,\" I beamed. \"She was on board the second I mentioned battling.\"\n\n\"Ho? This little thing?\"\n\nSurskit gave an indignant hiss.\n\n\"Easy. I just wouldn't have taken you for a battler is all.\" Rita looked down at Surskit with an uncharacteristic smile. \"I'm sure you'll grow up to be plenty strong.\"\n\nSurskit gave a huff, but seemed mollified for the moment.\n\n\"How about you, Rita? Did you catch a pokemon yet?\" I rose, dusting myself off.\n\nRita blinked, pausing for a moment. \"Oh, um. No, not yet.\"\n\n\"If you want, we could come with you and help you search.\" I offered. \"We should still have a couple of hours before sundown.\"\n\nRita stood quietly for a moment, thinking. \"You know what? I haven't had any luck so far. Why not.\"\n\n\"YES!\" I cheered.\n\n\"Shhh!\"\n\n\"Sorry. Yessss.\"\n\nOnce again, Rita rolled her eyes at me, but this time her face betrayed a slight smirk.",

Moves like Sweet Scent to lower evasion, Agility to get its ok speed to amazing speed, Sticky Web to make the enemy team slower, and Baton Pass to make sure your team always has the speed advantage. That's just with naturally learned moves. Add TMs and TRs into the mix you can add on Substitute and Gaga Drain, add Mud-Slap to make her even harder to hit. Blizzard for coverage and fuck it, Sweet Scent already makes them easy to hit, or just Rain Dance and Surf for a good stab move. Finally, with Shadow Ball to make her S.Attacks just hit that much harder, and good god, this is a monster in the making, ignoring the evaluation WHO WILL GET INTAMADATE AND QUIVER DANCE.

            "content": "Despite the throbbing soreness that snaked up through my ankles and feet, I found myself practically prancing along the wooded path. Rita had chastised me numerous times along our trek for making too much noise, but I found it increasingly difficult to contain my excitement. I captured a pokemon, after all! My first pokemon! I couldn't wait to show Grandpa and Florian when I returned home for the next break.\n\nRight now, Surskit didn't seem to particularly want to come out of her pokeball to walk with me, though. When I told her that it would be a while before we could battle, she elected to 'return' herself. I didn't know why the little bug seemed so keen on battling so soon, but it was what got her to join me, so I resolved to find her an opponent as soon as possible. I had to test my skills and take my first step as a trainer after all! I practically vibrated in place at the thought.\n\n\"So, if we go this way, there should be a cave at the end of this path..\" Rita trailed off, eyes focused on her map as we walked. Despite her eyes being fixed to the paper in her hands, she deftly maneuvered around fallen branches and underbrush.\n\n\"And that's where we'll find your pokemon?\" I called from behind, awkwardly pushing a branch away from my face.\n\n\"You'll see. Theres a particular pokemon I have my eye on, and I have a feeling I can find it there.\" Came Rita's reply.\n\n\"Oooh! What pokemon?\"\n\n\"You'll see.\"\n\nWe walked on in silence for a long stretch, which felt incredibly awkward. I found myself thinking a bit about what Beatrice had said- about Rita being a supposed 'violent delinquent.' She really didn't seem the type to me. Sure, she was a bit cold and unfriendly, but she had been nice enough to Surskit.\n\nDespite my better judgement, I decided to just come out and ask. We had a ways to go before arriving at our destination, and I figured it would be better to hear Rita's side of the story before I formed any sort of opinion on the matter.\n\n\"Hey Rita? There was something I wanted to ask you.\"\n\n\"Mmm?\" Rita looked over her shoulder, chewing on her fingernail. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Well I've noticed people tend to stay away from you, and well.. Someone told me some things about you, and I'm not sure what to think about it.\"\n\nRita stopped dead in her tracks.\n\n\"Oh? What kind of things did they say?\" Her face remained stone cold expressionless, but her tone betrayed a hint of annoyance.\n\n\"Erm. That you assaulted someone?\"\n\nRita smirked. \"What about it?\"\n\nI swallowed. \"So you actually did?\"\n\n\"Thats right,\" came Rita's nonchalant response. \"And I would do it again, too.\"\n\n\"O-oh.\" I stammered. \"I didn't expect such a forthright answer.\"\n\nSupport the author by searching for the original publication of this novel.\n\n\"I'm a lot of things, Peppa. But I'm not a liar.\"\n\nWith that, Rita turned away, and continued walking. I followed behind her silently, unsure of what to say. Maybe Beatrice had been right, and I've been rooming with a delinquent? I got the feeling that there had to be more to the story, but after that response, I was truthfully a bit afraid to ask and get on her bad side.\n\nWe soon arrived at our destination- a small grotto that cut into the side of a particularly steep, forested hill. By now the sun hung dangerously low above the shimmering psychic dome, and though Rita's expression remained stoic, she continued to bite at her nails. Time was of the essence.\n\nSwiftly we crept past a few sleeping Oddish and Gloom along the way, and made our way for the entrance, flashlights ready in hand. My spare hand rested tentatively on Surskit's pokeball, where it hung clipped to my belt loop. I would have liked to get some practice in with calling out moves, but no matter what we encountered, I had to be ready.\n\nUpon entering, my flashlight found a couple of Zubat and a sleeping Paras, but Rita confirmed that neither of which were the pokemon she had been searching for.\n\n\"Its probably a little deeper,\" She whispered.\n\nWe pressed on, and I became more and more uncomfortable as the walls began to narrow. Thankfully, at a certain point we reached a larger 'room' connected to a tunnel, where a bit of light trickled in from a hole in the cave's ceiling.\n\n\"Shh- there!\"\n\nIn the center of the cave lay Rita's quarry, a couple of resting Gible that lay beside a veritable mound of stashed berries.\n\nImmediately I took a few steps back.\n\n\"Rita, I really don't think thats a good idea.\" I spoke in the lowest register I could manage.\n\n\"What? Why?\"\n\n\"Those are Gible.. Even I know that there could be a Garchomp nearby.\"\n\n\"Relax. They wouldn't allow such a dangerous pokemon near students.\"\n\n\"If...If you say so. But I really don't think its a good idea.\"\n\n\"Then stay here and watch, scaredy-cat.\"\n\nRita crept forward, pokeball in hand.\n\n\"And what do you think you're doing?\" A voice called through the cave, sending both of our heads swiveling towards its source.\n\nImmediately, the Gible became startled and fled.\n\n\"Augh! Why would you do that?\" Rita snarled.\n\nFrom farther in the cave, Beatrice and another girl I didn't recognize stepped forward into the light.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be catching a Chansey or something anyways?\" The girl said, tousling a lock of blonde, curly hair.\n\n\"And what business is it of yours what I catch, Claire?\" Rita growled.\n\n\"Its my business as the Student Council president to make sure that a dangerous delinquent like yourself doesn't get her hands on a dangerous pokemon.\" Beatrice spoke in a cool, even tone. \"Thats why I've caught a Gible, to make sure that it doesn't fall into the hands of someone.. less responsible.\"\n\n\"Thats what this is about? You've been at this all day. What do you want from me, Beatrice?\" the pink-haired girl stomped her foot, startling a few Zubat from their resting spots farther up in the cave. \"Is every pokemon too dangerous?\"\n\n\"Wait, they've been following you?\" I asked.\n\nRita looked away, not meeting my eyes.\n\n\"Rita, is that why you haven't caught a pokemon yet? You guys are intentionally sabotaging her exam, aren't you?\"\n\n\"And what if I am? Do you really think our school has a place for people like her?\" Beatrice responded calmly.\n\nRage swelled within my chest, and a familiar throbbing returned to my head. I had been bullied once, in my past life. Though the details were foggy, I could recall the feelings. Even if Rita did the things they said she did, that didn't make what they were doing okay.\n\n\"You're a bully.\"\n\n\"A bully?\" Beatrice laughed. \"And what do you propose she is, attacking a defenseless student?\"\n\n\"Two wrongs dont make a right!\" I spat. \"It isn't right for you to decide someone else's future.\"\n\n\"Well then, I can see we aren't going to agree on this. Why don't we settle this the old fashioned way?\"\n\n\"Wh-what?\" I stammered, taken aback momentarily.\n\nBeatrice merely gestured towards my belt loop. \"You've caught a pokemon, yes?\"\n\nI gave a slow nod.\n\nBeatrice's eyes met mine, burning like dark cinders. \"If you're to be a real trainer then, what do you say we settle this with a battle?\"",

            "content": "Steeling myself, I gripped Surskit's pokeball tight with a shaking hand. Squaring off opposite of me, Beatrice stood without any cracks in her perfect icy veneer. Her diminutive form cut a long shadow against the cave's wall; her jet black hair seemed to meld with the shadows in a way that set me on edge.\n\nIt goes without saying that I would have preferred time to practice or even learn what moves Surskit has in her arsenal before battling, but there was nothing for it- I just had to make do.\n\n\"Rita, will you stand as referee? Surely you can get that right?\" Claire taunted.\n\n\"Enough,\" Beatrice snapped, causing Claire to visibly straighten.\n\n\"Whatever,\" Rita replied. \"Peppa, you don't have to do this. You just caught Surskit, and neither of you are experienced in battles yet. She could get hurt.\"\n\n\"Dont worry,\" Beatrice cut in. \"We'll make sure to pull our punches.\"\n\nI couldn't help but bristle.\n\n\"Surskit will be fine.\" I snarled. \"Its Beatrice you should worry about.\"\n\n\"Ohoh? I like that attitude.\" Beatrice smirked.\n\n\"Alright, the rules are simple. A clean one-on-one battle. The battle ends when either pokemon are unable to continue.\" Rita explained as we took our positions. \"Please call your pokemon.\"\n\n\"Drifloon.\" As Beatrice spoke, a spherical form of ghostly energy rose from her shadow, materializing into a drifloon in front of her. If not for the situation, I probably would have fangirled over how cute the pokemon was. Drifloon's body was basically a purple balloon with two black eyes and an \"X\" for a mouth. Two string like arms hung from its body, and a small cloud rested atop its head. Admittedly, Drifloon was probably among the cutest ghost pokemon there were.\n\n\"I thought you said you had a Gible?\" Rita asked.\n\n\"I never said I had only one pokemon,\" Came Beatrice's response. \"Drifloon are native to this area, we see them at the Valley windworks quite often.\"\n\n\"Surskit, come on out!\" I called, holding out Surskit's pokeball. In a flash of red, Surskit materialized.\n\n\"Are you ready for that battle, Surskit?\" I asked.\n\nFire burned in the little bugs eyes as she pumped a leg in the air. \"Surrrs!\"\n\n\"Ready?\" Rita called. \"Begin!\"\n\n\"Drifloon, astonish!\" Beatrice barked out before I could react, and her Drifloon bounded forward. In an instant Surskit was slapped with one of Drifloon's arms, which caused her to momentarily flinch.\n\n\"Gust!\" She barked again. Drifloon bobbled backward, and unleashed a torrent of wind that threatened super-effective damage against Surskit.\n\n\"Surskit, dodge!\" I yelled, but was a second too late. Surskit leapt through the air, and though she manage to avoid the brunt of the attack, she had been clipped. Surskit hit the ground on her side with a painful thud.\n\nUnauthorized duplication: this narrative has been taken without consent. Report sightings.\n\n\"Surskit! Are you okay?\" I rushed forward to her side.\n\n\"Surs! Skkkttt!\" Surskit hissed, stopping me. With only a slight wobble she rose, her eyes trained on her opponent.\n\n\"Alright, if you're sure.\" I nodded. With that, our fight resumed.\n\n\"Surskit, use bubble!\" At my command, the little bug released a torrent of the stinging bubbles I had been hit with only hours prior. Unfortunately, the stream of bubble scattered uselessly, allowing for Drifloon to easily dodge without Beatrice issuing a command.\n\n\"Fla-fla-flooon.\" The cheeky balloon pokemon seemed to chuckle, clearly mocking Surskit.\n\n\"Skkkt-ttt-tt!\" Surskit hissed, and without warning she rushed forward, recklessly charging at her opponent.\n\n\"Surskit no!\" I cried, but it was too late.\n\nBeatrice wasted no time in seizing the opportunity. \"Drifloon, use gust!\"\n\nMy poor bug had fallen for Drifloons taunting** and got right up in its face. Another gale formed in front of Drifloon and surged forward, hitting Surskit head-on at point blank range.\n\nSurskit flew backwards, smacking into the wall of the cave, before hitting the ground with a pitiful whimper.\n\n\"Surskit is unable to battle,\" Rita called, her expression unreadable. \"Beatrice is the winner.\"\n\n\"Surskit.. I'm sorry.\" I scooped up my battered bug. \"You did a good job. We just need more practice.\"\n\n\"Skk..ttt.\" Surskit let out a quiet chitter, weakly pumping her foot in the air. The poor thing still had fight in her yet.\n\n\"Haha, yeah. You're a fighter.\" I gave Surskit a half-hearted smile, before returning her to her pokeball.\n\n\"What was that about 'Its Beatrice you should worry about', Peppa?\" Claire mocked. \"Surely you didn't expect to win with that bug?\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" I snarled. \"You can mock me, but don't you dare mock Surskit.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'll learn something from this, Peppa Carmine.\" Beatrice strode forward. \"But I doubt it. Drifloon, return.\" Drifloon once again vanished, presumably taking its place in Beatrice's shadow once more.\n\n\"Now. Since you've lost, Rita can return to the meeting point. Empty handed.\" Beatrice stated in a matter-of fact tone.\n\n\"What? We never agreed on that.\" I protested.\n\n\"But didn't we? I said we'd settle it with a battle.\" Beatrice smirked. \"Its settled.\"\n\n\"Peppa, its fine.\" Rita interjected before I could speak. \"Lets just go.\"\n\nSwept up in the heat of the moment, I agreed to a battle without even agreeing on the stakes- and now Rita was paying the price for that. I lamented my own stupidity- if only I had trained a bit beforehand, or not let Beatrice get a rise out of me in the first place. Worse yet, Surskit got hurt because of my own ineptitude, just as Rita had warned me. If only I had listened. Who did I think I was to fight someone else's battle?\n\n\"Rita.. I'm sor-\"\n\nBefore I could get the words out, the cavern began to shake.\n\n\"GRRROOOAAAARRRrr\" A fearsome voice thundered, sending loose stones skittering down the side of the cave wall.\n\nMy head snapped to Rita, who's usually stoic face was now plastered pale with fear.\n\n\"You don't think..\" She uttered, as the rumbling drew closer.\n\n\"GRAAAAAOOORHhh\"\n\nA flock of panicked Zubat came screeching from farther in the cave, rushing past us. I covered my face as wings smacked my body; the pokemon didn't even attempt to avoid us in their haste.\n\n\"Beatrice!\" the haughty blonde now clung to her friend's side. \"We need to go!\"\n\nBeatrice's expression remained calm, despite her clearly trembling hands. She cleared her throat.\n\n\"Don't panic; make your way towards the exit, hurry!\" she ordered, and we obeyed.\n\nBeatrice and Claire ran ahead of us through the snaking tunnels of the cave. As we ran we were flanked by a deluge of panicked pokemon; a few Paras skittered along the walls while I struggled not to trip over a group of fleeing Sandshrew.\n\n\"GROooARR!!\" The rumbling drew closer yet.\n\n\"Hurry you two!\" Beatrice called from ahead. \"We're almost there!\"\n\nAs we bounded around a corner, I smacked into a large boulder that had been presumably dislodged from the ceiling that now blocked our path. I scrambled to climb over it, but failed to get a grip on the hard stone.\n\n\"We're stuck! Help!\" I shouted ahead.\n\n\"Hold on! Buizel, go!\" Claire called out.\n\nA torrent of water sprayed over me from behind the boulder, shimmering uselessly across its surface.\n\n\"Claire, leave them!\" Beatrice barked.\n\n\"What?!\" Rita and I shouted simultaneously.\n\nFor a few moments there was silence, save for the rumbling that drew ever closer.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" Came Claire's response. \"We'll get help!\"\n\n\"Wait no--\" I started, but it was no use. The sound of the girl's footsteps drew farther and farther away.\n\n“I think they left us behind.” I blurted.\n\nRita swung her face at me, eyes wide and eyebrows high.",

            "content": "\"That bitch!\" Rita snarled, kicking a pebble into the wall.\n\n\"I cant believe they left us.\" I muttered incredulously.\n\nRita rolled her eyes. \"I can. Leave it to Ms. Student Council President to save her own hide.\"\n\nAs the rumbling drew closer, I searched desperately for a way out.\n\n\"Rita, let me try to hoist you up over the boulder.\"\n\n\"What?!\" She exclaimed. \"No! I'm not just going to bail.\"\n\n\"Its our only option! Maybe I can keep it busy. Take Surskit's pokeball and get help. We have no way of knowing if Beatrice and Claire actually will.\"\n\n\"No, we have one other option.\" Rita grit her teeth. \"I didn't want to use this, but at this point I will probably be expelled anyways.\"\n\nA heavy stomp shook me to my core. From the darkened tunnel, a clawed foot stepped forward, scoring lines in the damp cavern floor. The source of the rumbling was on us—a snarling, enraged Gabite.\n\nRita took a step towards the Gabite, and taking a deep breath, reached a hand into her coat pocket.\n\n\"Rita, what are you doing?\" I shouted.\n\n\"Just trust me!\"\n\nFrom her pocket Rita revealed a pink and white pokeball that glinted under the light of my flashlight, and held it towards our encroaching pursuer.\n\n\"Grimer, go!\"\n\nIn a flash of red, a purple ooze-like pokemon materialized in front of her. The slimy pokemon stood at about three feet tall, but faced the easily five-foot gabite with a steely look in its eyes.\n\n\"GRAAAaOOR!\" The Gabite roared, again shaking the tunnel. Without any hesitation it charged Rita's Grimer.\n\n\"Grimer, minimize!\" Rita called. In an instant Grimer shrunk down, allowing it to easily slip away from Gabites charge, which continued until the pokemon crashed into a wall- narrowly avoiding Rita in the process.\n\n\"Now, poison gas, Grimer!\" Rita wasted no time as the furious Gabite scrambled to dislodge its head from the wall.\n\nClawed, fin like arms frantically scrambled at the rock, struggling to find purchase. Just as the Gabite managed to free itself, Grimer surged forward, hitting the Gabite directly with a spray of toxic gas.\n\nFurious, the Gabite slashed through the poisonous cloud, its claw managing to lop off one of Grimer's oozey arms. Within seconds the arm reformed, but even without considering the minimize move that Grimer had employed, Grimer was looking considerably smaller.\n\n\"Grimer, back up! Clear some distance!\" Rita shouted.\n\nThe story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.\n\nGrimer heeded her command, but Gabite was hot on its tail. The Gabite slashed again and again, lopping off sections of ooze left and right.\n\n\"Harden! Use harden!\"\n\nGrimer's body flashed with a gray light in an instant, and this time Gabite's claw only sunk into Grimer's slime partially instead of cutting clean through.\n\n\"Again!\"\n\nAgain Grimer's body shimmered with gray energy, and the second blow from Gabite's claw sent sparks flying as if it had struck stone. Grimer had still taken damage, but the amount had decreased significantly. This didn't change that Grimer was still clearly in a bad way. Despite this, however, the pokemon's steely expression had not faltered once. This was a pokemon that had clearly seen battle before.\n\nMy mind swam. Why had Rita lied to me?\n\nAs Gabite reared its clawed arm back to strike at the Grimer once more, Grimer once again unleashed another spray of foul-smelling gas point-blank in Gabite's face. For a moment the Gabite faltered, taking a step back. The pokemon's body momentarily became surrounded in a thin purple miasma- Gabite had been succesfully poisoned. Now the battle would be a matter of holding the Gabite off until it succumbed to its poisoning- though with the damage Grimer had already sustained, that would not be an easy feat.\n\nOnce again the two pokemon resumed the cycle of striking and dodging- blows glanced off of Grimer's body, slowly chipping away at it. At this rate, Grimer would be the one to fall first. As if tiring from this cycle, the Gabite once again bellowed a furious roar- fierce white energy gathered around its claws, as it sought to deliver a final blow. From what I could remember, I assumed this move to be Slash.\n\n\"Grimer minimize, evade!\" Rita cried, but it was too late. The move found its target, sending Grimer flying back into the tunnel wall.\n\nRita rushed to return her pokemon, but Grimer slowly shambled upright oncemore.\n\n\"Guuhh...rime.\" The pokemon once again moved forward, chunks of slimy mass falling off its body in small clumps.\n\n\"No, Grimer! You've done enough!\" Rita protested.\n\nThe Gabite snarled, clearly intending to finish the job.\n\nWithout thinking, I reached into my bag and lobbed the first thing I could find at the charging pokemon, which happened to be a berry. It spattered across the top of Gabite's head harmlessly, but I had succeeded in distracting it momentarily. The Gabite turned to me, its eyes blazing with barely contained fury.\n\nAll at once the cave shook, sending a spray of pebbles and dust flying onto the narrow battlefield. I coughed, rubbing the dust from my eyes.\n\n\"And what do we have here?\" A familiar voice called from the source of the crash. The boulder had been blown to bits, and in its place now stood large pokemon-- Rhydon, if memory served. Ms. Kimber stepped from behind the menacing Rhydon, meeting our gazes with a nonchalant smile.\n\n\"I see, a Gabite, huh?\" she mused. \"I had heard that there would be Gibble present for students to capture, but one of them must have evolved.\"\n\n\"Rhydon, go.\" She waved her hand, and the gray tank of a pokemon rushed forward, striking the Gabite over the head with one of its thick arms. Gabite abrubtly fell face-forward into the dirt, and did not move again.\n\nMs. Kimber threw a pokeball at the downed Gabite, and in a flash of light, the pokemon disappeared. The pokeball hit the ground with a metallic thump. I stood awestruck as the pokeball rocked back and forth a couple of times, before confirming the capture with a satisying 'click'.\n\n\"Aughhhh,\" I deflated instantly, allowing myself to slide down the tunnel wall momentarily. At this point, I had a headache from how long my heart had been pounding in my ears.\n\n\"You two are unharmed, right?\" Ms. Kimber asked as she approached. \"Asides from this one.\" She gestured at the shambling blob Rita now cradled in her arms.\n\n\"Yes,\" Rita responded without looking up.\n\n\"Your Grimer must have fought hard to last that long against a Gabite. I'm glad I got here in time.\" Ms. Kimber scratched her head. \"But I don't remember Grimer being on the list of possible encounters?\"\n\nRita froze, still not meeting our teacher's eyes, before returning Grimer to its pokeball.\n\n\"That pokeball isn't one of the ones we issued either. Care to explain?\"\n\n\"I will explain everything,\" Rita started. \"Just.. please don't take him away.\"",

            "content": "\"A year ago, a pokemon was brought to the Pokemon Center with extensive injuries. I had heard from one of my sisters that he had come from our school's campus.\"\n\nPain clouded Rita's eyes as she spoke.\n\n\"He was... not much more than a scrap of slime at that time. I still don't know how he survived, but if I had to guess it was because he was determined to pull through. I felt horrible—it was my first time seeing a pokemon in that state, you see. He was so weak.\"\n\nMs. Kimber gave Rita a sympathetic nod. \"Its okay. Take your time.\"\n\n\"Well, when I spoke to the students who had brought him in, they told me that someone had done this to him— Someone from our school. I was furious, I needed to know why. When I asked who it was, they had described an upperclassman who I was familiar with; a boy from the Battlers Club.\"\n\n\"I seem to recall something like this, though I wasn't present at the time.\" Ms. Kimber hummed.\n\n\"The next day at school I approached the boy in the stairwell before classes. I asked him why he did it. And do you know what he said?\" Rita's face twisted into a mask of uncharacteristic rage. \"He said he was exterminating a pest.\"\n\nI grimaced. It was certainly true that many held pokemon like Grimer in that regard, but to seek to exterminate one.. the thought made my stomach churn.\n\n\"I was so angry, I didn't even think; I just saw red. When I shoved him backwards, I hadn't even meant to push him down the stairs.\" Rita's fists clenched. \"But I don't feel bad about what I did. After seeing Grimer in that state... No, anyone who could hurt an innocent Pokémon in that way deserves what they have coming to them.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see. While I cant condone violence, I cant say I blame you. Seeing that at your age must have been shocking, even for a member of the Joy family.\" Ms. Kimber responded. \"If I remember correctly, your family pulled strings to reduce your expulsion to a suspension.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's correct.\" Rita's shoulders slumped. \"After I pushed him, everyone was looking at me like I was a monster. They still look at me that way now. Sometimes I wonder if expulsion may have been better.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, you did break the rules of this exam, so there still may be time for that yet.\" Ms. Kimber frowned. \"You haven't explained why you brought Grimer with you today.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry— yes, I am prepared for the consequences. You see, due to Grimer's status as an invasive species in most areas, my family was struggling to find somewhere to relocate him after he recovered enough to be moved from the intensive care unit. We asked a few poison specialist trainers if they would be interested in taking Grimer, but most of them hadn't been interested in rehabilitating a pokemon with such extensive injuries. As a result, my family decided to keep him in our home.\"\n\n\"The problem was that Grimer, well... Grimers naturally have a rather foul stench. Keeping him in our home proved to be a bit of a challenge, but I had grown attached to him at this point. The way he pushed himself to recover inspired me; I couldn't let my family resume talks of getting rid of him. I begged my parents to let me keep him, even though I legally couldn't have a pokemon yet. And well, they eventually caved. Though Grimer is technically registered to my mother at this time, I have been solely responsible for his care.\"\n\nIf you spot this story on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\n\n\"I had never intended to use Grimer in today's exam, but since the incident, I can't stand being away from him. I cant trust that something wont happen to him again.\"\n\n\"So you intended to capture a pokemon today without using Grimer to legitimize your status as a trainer?\" Ms Kimber cut in.\n\n\"Yes. Once I became a legally registered trainer, I intended to have Grimer traded to me.\" Rita nodded. \"I would do anything to be his trainer.\"\n\n\"I see. Tell you what,\" Ms. Kimber hummed, taking a few steps towards the entrance. \"Give me Grimer's pokeball.\"\n\nRita flinched backward, holding Grimer's pokeball behind her back.\n\n\"Hear me out first, kid.\" Ms. Kimber started. \"I will return Grimer after the exam ends— You have one hour to catch a pokemon, legitimately. If you succeed, I won't say anything. You'll be a real trainer, and Grimer will be none of my business. If you fail, well— I'll just return Grimer to your family.\"\n\nRita paused, taking a moment to think over Ms. Kimber's offer.\n\n\"Why would you help me?\" She asked.\n\n\"Because, I have a soft spot for trainers like you. The kind that would do anything to protect their pokemon.\" Ms Kimber gave a warm smile.\n\n\"Rita, I think you should do it.\" I interjected. \"It'll be hard but I think we can do it. Theres no rule that we cant work together, right?\"\n\n\"Thats correct, but seeing as you've already caught a pokemon, you'll need to come back to the meeting point with me so we can get you registered as a trainer.\"\n\nI shot Rita an apologetic look.\n\n\"Its okay, Peppa. I can do this.\" Rita spoke, and I wasn't sure if she was assuring me or herself. \"You need to get Surskit looked at, anyways.\"\n\n\"Ah, a Surskit? Not a popular first catch.\" Ms. Kimber turned to me.\n\nI shrugged. \"Surskit is awesome.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure.\" Ms. Kimber winked. \"Lets go get your friend looked at then.\"\n\n\"Good luck, Rita.\" I reached a hand towards the pink-haired girl. \"I wish that I could stay.\"\n\nRita scoffed lightly, but shook my hand back. \"Don't worry. I'll see you later, Pep.\"\n\nWith that, I followed Ms. Kimber through the dense forest, daring not to look behind me. As nervous as I was on Rita's behalf, I had full confidence that she could manage. She had battled so competently against the Gabite, and without Beatrice and Claire in the picture to sabotage her chances, there was no reason to not be optimistic.\n\nBy the time we had returned to the meeting point, the sun had sunk low above the shimmering dome. The handful of Kadabras I had seen upon arrival still hummed dutifully with psychic energy.\n\nMost of the other students had made it back by now, save for a handful. I saw Beatrice talking to a group of girls who were presumably showing off their new captures, but I didn't bother with approaching her. By now my feet screamed with every step, and truth be told, I was too tired for any more confrontation at this given moment.\n\nMs. Kimber ushered me to a makeshift triage station, before leaving me in the care of a Nurse Joy took Surskit's pokeball. The nurse also looked over me briefly before returning to tending to the other pokemon.\n\n\"Pep! Over here!\" Tom called to me from across the crowd.\n\nBefore I could move, the portly boy jogged over to me, holding a rather aloof-looking Lotad in his arms.\n\n\"I wanted to show you my pokemon!\" Tom beamed.\n\n\"Oh, nice! A lotad.\" I yawned. \"I had seen some floating down the river earlier, but they didn't pay me any mind.\"\n\n\"Yeah, they are chill guys.\" Tom started. \"Are you okay? You look really tired.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm okay. I ran into.. Well, some trouble, but I managed. Nurse Joy has my pokemon right now. I'm waiting for her to be done so I can get registered.\"\n\n\"Why don't we get you some water, and you can tell me about it while we wait?\"\n\n\"Ugh, bless you Tom.\" I allowed my shoulder to sag with exhaustion. \"Water sounds great right about now.\"",

            "content": "I internally praised Arceus as the cool water soothed my sore, partially-burned throat. Tom and I took a seat in the grass while we waited for Nurse Joy to be done with Surskit. While we waited, I filled Tom in on the details of everything that had transpired, though I elected to leave out as many of the details about Rita as I could. It wasn't my place to tell her story, after all. Tom's hazel eyes stayed locked on mine the entire time I spoke; giving me his full attention. I really did get the impression that Tom was a considerate sort, after all.\n\n\"Wow, so you really battled the Student Council President?\" The boy asked, his sandy-blonde hair waving in the late-afternoon breeze.\n\n\"Mhm. And lost miserably.\" I added.\n\n\"Still, how did it feel to have your first battle?\"\n\n\"Honestly? I was so nervous. I knew I would make mistakes, but seeing Surskit rush in and get hurt.. It was hard.\"\n\nTom said nothing other than offering a quiet \"Mm,\" in response.\n\n\"Peppa Carmine?\" Nurse Joy called across the crowd of students. \"Is Peppa Carmine present?\"\n\nI shot up, waving my hand high in the air. \"I'm here!\"\n\n\"Your pokemon is all set!\"\n\nI eagerly pushed my way through the crowd towards the triage station. There, Nurse Joy cheerfully handed me Surskit's pokeball. I was surprised by how quickly she had worked, on account of how many students were present. As I readily prepared to release Surskit, Nurse Joy stopped me.\n\n\"If you'll wait just a couple of minutes, I'm also all set to get you registered now.\"\n\n\"Oh—sorry. Okay.\"\n\n\"If I could just have you step up to this desk..\"\n\nThe process of getting registered was relatively simple. Nurse Joy asked me a few questions and entered my information into what resembled a tablet from Earth. Once done, she had me take a quick picture, and a nifty little contraption on the desk spat out my Trainer ID card. The card itself wasn't much different than a regular ID card, but featured an iridescent watermark of a pokeball, marking my status as a registered trainer. I fiddled with the thing for a second, marveling at how the watermark caught the light, before slipping it into my wallet.\n\nI thanked Nurse Joy for her help, and made my way back to Tom, who looked to be chatting with a few other students.\n\n\"Oh, Pep! We were just showing off our new pokemon,\" Tom called. \"Come show us yours!\"\n\nThe group's eyes lingered on me as I approached, filling me with a sense of apprehension. Around the circle, a boy stood with a Chimchar on his shoulders, another girl had a Shinx—another had a Starly, and so on. I looked around the crowd, and found no bug-type pokemon to speak of. I internally prepared myself for the comments that would no doubt be levied my way.\n\nIf you find this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the infringement.\n\nHere goes nothing. I unclipped Surskit's pokeball from my belt loop.\n\n\"Surskit, go!\"\n\nIn a flash, my little bug appeared, fiery as ever. \"Skkktt-tt-tt!\" She hissed at the surrounding pokemon, as if issuing a challenge. The reactions from the surrounding pokemon were a mix of confusion and open hostility.\n\n\"Woah there little one! Lets calm down,\" I scooped the rambunctious bug into my arms. She allowed it with minimal protest, but gave me a quiet huff before climbing up onto my shoulder.\n\n\"Oh.. uh, a bug..\" The girl with the shinx muttered.\n\n\"Whats wrong with bugs?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well.. they're um..\"\n\n\"I think Surskit is cute.\" Tom interjected.\n\nSurskit preened under Tom's praise.\n\n\"Seriously though, whats wrong with bugs?\" Despite my better judgement, I chose not to let the comment slide.\n\n\"Well, they are the weakest type,\" The boy with the Chimchar added.\n\n\"Says who?\" I bristled.\n\n\"Well... Everybody?\"\n\nTom's eyes darted between me and the boy nervously.\n\n\"Look.. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, but some pokemon are just better than others.\" The boy gave me a smug smirk and shrugged. \"Like Chimchar, here.\"\n\n\"Liam!\" Tom snapped. \"Theres no need for that.\"\n\n\"I think all pokemon are good if you train them right.\" I frowned.\n\n\"Sure, but a surskit isn't going to hold up much competitively.\" Liam stated in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\n\"Surss! Skktt-ttt!\" Surskit hissed indignantly from my shoulder.\n\n\"Don't listen to him, Surskit. I think you're plenty strong.\" I gave my bug a pat on the head.\n\nAn awkward tension filled the air as the group exchanged glances. As much as I wanted to pursue the issue and convince everyone that Surskit is the best, I would have to pick my battles. It wouldn't do to issue another challenge without training first. I would just have to be content to show them once Surskit and I got some meaningful training in. For now, I resolved to eventually make this 'Liam' guy eat his words.\n\n\"Pep!\" Rita's voice called, snapping me from my thoughts.\n\nBless Rita for giving me an out to this conversation.\n\n\"Rita, you're back!\" I jogged to meet her, ignoring the stares of my peers. \"How did it go?\"\n\n\"Good, thankfully. I managed to snag an Oddish just in the nick of time. The little guy couldn't resist my berries.\" Rita's deadpan expression revealed a slight smile. I got the impression that this was her version of 'beaming with pride'.\n\n\"Let me see!\"\n\n\"I will— but later,\" She leaned in close to whisper. \"I still need to go get Grimer.\"\n\nAfter retrieving Grimer's pokeball, we made our way to the triage desk to get all of Rita's pokemon checked out. While there Rita was also registered as a trainer. Presumably, Rita had been the last to return because as soon as we finished, Ms. Kimber gathered the class up to prepare to leave.\n\n\"I am proud to announce that none of you have failed today,\" Ms. Kimber addressed the class. \"Which means you are all now registered trainers. I expect you all to abide by the rules of the Pokemon League, and to treat your pokemon, as well as your fellow trainers, with the dignity and respect that they deserve.\"\n\n\"As for your pokemon's care- We will be giving all of you a weeks supply of pokemon food, but after that, it will be your responsibility. We will have a brief refresher course tomorrow on pokemon care and nutrition. As far as your grades for this exam go, they will be posted within a weeks time. All of you will be individually graded based on the surveillance footage we have.\"\n\nI grimaced. I had expected that they had had some method of surveilling us, but this only served to remind me that somebody would see my mishap with the Cherri berry.\n\n\"You will be permitted to walk back to campus with your pokemon, but keep in mind that once we arrive, your pokemon will only be allowed out of its pokeball in designated areas. Any questions?\"\n\nThe throng of students was unusually silent. Everyone must have been as tired as I was.\n\n\"Great, lets head back!\"",

            "content": "Golden light shone brilliantly off of the cityscape as Jubilife came into view. Though my feet ached, I enjoyed the walk back from Route 204 far more than I had on the way there. At some point Surskit had become tired, and though I offered her pokeball, she seemed to prefer to cuddle up inside of my bag. Rita and I had chatted a bit along the way, and she introduced me to her Oddish, who she now carried in her arms. I found the little grass-type adorable; three leaves adorned its 'head', or body for that matter—though one of the leaves seemed to be a bit crumpled in a way that stood out to me as unique.\n\nUpon arriving in front of the dorm building, we were again approached by Beatrice and Claire. Beatrice's Drifloon bobbled behind her in the light, while Claire's Buizel walked on foot by her side.\n\n\"I see you didn't fail after all,\" Beatrice remarked.\n\n\"What do you want, Beatrice?\" Rita ground out. The Oddish in her arms looked up at Rita with a confused expression.\n\n\"Just to congratulate you. I was glad to hear that you both made it back safely.\" Beatrice gave a slight, haughty smirk.\n\n\"Sure,\" I spat. \"You left us to die.\"\n\nClaire grimaced. Despite her earlier behavior, she offered no snide remarks to speak of this time.\n\n\"Left you to die?\" Beatrice scoffed. \"No, I went and got help like any respectable member of the student council would have.\"\n\n\"What I would like to know, however, is how you managed to hold out. I'm told you somehow managed to fend off an enraged Gabite?\"\n\n\"Ms. Kimber defeated the Gabite,\" Rita corrected her. I nodded in agreement.\n\nBeatrice pursed her lips, keenly aware that she wouldn't get a straight answer from either of us.\n\n\"Well. Let's see if your luck continues.\" With that, Beatrice stalked off, her pokemon bobbing behind her sleepily.\n\n\"..Sorry.\" Claire mumbled, before jogging after her friend.\n\nRita and I exchanged a glance.\n\n\"Well at least Claire seemed to feel bad.\" I offered.\n\nRita looked unconvinced.\n\nAfter Rita and I had both had turns in the shower, I filled the bathtub with cool water for Surskit. She seemed to enjoy skittering across the water, no matter how small the surface area of it was. I sat with my head propped up on the side of the tub, watching my bug happily splash and skitter about. Despite my weariness from the day's events, watching my very own pokemon filled me with a sense of pride and elation. I truly couldn't wait to show her off to my family.\n\nA feeling of dread settled in my stomach upon recalling the other student's reactions to Surskit. What if my family saw her the same way?\n\nA knock at the door pulled me from my thoughts.\n\n\"Come in!\" I shouted over my shoulder.\n\n\"Sorry, am I interupting? I wanted to get ready for bed,\" Rita said from a crack in the door.\n\n\"No, not at all. I'm just watching Surskit enjoy herself.\"\n\n\"Surss!\" Surskit happily trilled.\n\n\"She really seems to like the bathtub, huh?\" Rita mused.\n\nThe story has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.\n\n\"Yeah. She's been at it for a while. I thought she'd get tired of it by now, but it makes sense that a water type would want to be near water.\"\n\nWe fell into a companiable silence for a moment, as Rita continued to comb her hair.\n\n\"Long day, huh?\" I yawned.\n\n\"Yeah.. A lot happened.\" Rita sighed.\n\n\"How are you holding up?\" I turned to Rita.\n\n\"Honestly? I'm still a bit shaken.\"\n\n\"From the whole Gabite thing?\"\n\n\"We could have died, Pep.\" Rita placed the comb on the edge of the sink. \"We could have died and they left us. I knew that Beatrice had it out for me, but I didn't think she'd stoop that low.\"\n\n\"Its probably better that she didn't find out about Grimer, though.\" I replied. \"She probably would have found some way to use it against you.\"\n\n\"True,\" Rita grumbled. \"But I'm angry. I just wish there were some way to get back at her, you know?\"\n\n\"You could always challenge her to a battle,\" I started. \"Though that didn't work out so well for me.\"\n\nSurskit bristled for a moment.\n\n\"Sorry Surskit— It wasn't your fault. We just need some more practice.\" I smiled at my bug.\n\n\"Do you think I could win?\" Rita asked, folding her arms.\n\n\"With the way you battled that Gabite? Totally, Rita. You and Grimer both rocked.\"\n\nRita gave a slight smile.\n\n\"Why don't we train tomorrow, after classes?\"\n\nI started up at her, wide-eyed. \"You want to train together?\"\n\n\"Ugh, dont make it weird.\" Rita scoffed. \"But yeah. I think we'll improve more if we both have someone to practice with.\"\n\nI felt the corners of my lips curl into a devious grin. \"Training buddies.\" I whispered.\n\n\"Okay— I'm going to bed. Goodnight, Pep.\" Rita rolled her eyes, before making her way towards the door.\n\n\"Oh— And Pep?\" Rita spoke with her back turned to me. \"Thankyou. For having my back earlier.\"\n\nThe girl closed the door behind her without giving me a chance to respond.\n\nClasses seemed to drag on throughout the day as I anticipated my upcoming training session with Surskit. Other than chatting with Tom a bit and Ms. Kimber's refresher course on Pokemon care, nothing of much note happened.\n\nAfter classes had finally ended, I met with Rita, and we made our way to the school's designated training areas. The area was about the size of two football fields, featuring multiple dirt 'arena' areas. Unfortunately for us, all but one of the arenas had been completely full with trainers who, much like us, were clearly eager to train their newly caught pokemon. Truthfully, I had hoped for something a bit more private— eyes followed Rita and I as we made our way to the sole empty arena.\n\nWe released our pokemon and engaged in some light stretching, before setting to the task at hand.\n\n\"Alright Surskit, lets start by seeing your moves.\" I called to my little bug.\n\n\"Surss!\" She happily trilled, before launching a Water Gun directly into my face.\n\nI took a step backwards from the force but was otherwise unhurt. \"Okay very funny—so you know Water Gun.\" I grumbled, feeling my face flush. \"Can we try that again, without hitting me in the face?\n\n\"Skktt-tt-tt-tt!\" Surskit seemed to laugh.\n\nRita looked away as I turned to her, as if holding back a similar chuckle.\n\nThis time, Surskit demonstrated her Water Gun again for me, without any of her previous antics. Following that, she released a barrage of directionless bubbles that seemed to float in all directions.\n\n\"That looks like Bubble,\" Rita started. \"But I dont think its strong enough to do any damage.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we tried that one during the fight with Beatrice, remember? It ended up not hitting Drifloon at all.\"\n\nSurskit momentarily looked dejected.\n\n\"Dont worry, we'll work on it.\" I started. \"Do you have any other moves?\"\n\n\"Surs!\" Surskit's body flashed with a clear white, Normal-type energy, before zipping forward a few feet.\n\n\"Oh! Thats quick attack!\" I clapped. \"That's a useful one!\" Quick attack had been a priority move in the games, meaning it always hit first. I doubted it would work the same way here, but either way, having a reliable method to close gaps or escape would be invaluable.\n\nFor Surskit's final move, she secreted a sweet-smelling liquid from the tip of her antennae that seemed to draw the attention of all the surrounding pokemon. We determined this move to be Sweet Scent. I didn't think it would require any training, as it seemed just be something Surskit's species could innately do, but I figured it may be useful in the future for attracting wild pokemon.\n\nMoving on, Rita and I watched as Rita's Oddish went through a similar procession of showing off her moves. Oddish seemed to know Absorb, Growth, and Acid.\n\nOddish and Surskit played happily in the sun while Grimer demonstrated his moves, most of which I had seen yesterday. Grimer knew Poison Gas, Pound, Harden, and Minimize. Based on what I presumed his level to be, he should have known Disable or Sludge, but it seemed as if he hadn't learned either yet. My guess was that the way pokemon learned moves in this world was probably completely different.\n\nI suggested the moves to Rita, but she eyed me dubiously.\n\n\"How would you know what Grimer learns?\" She asked, genuinely sounding confused.\n\n\"Oh uh— I saw a tournament on TV with a Grimer that used those moves.\" I lied.\n\n\"Oh. Makes sense,\" Rita responded. \"I'll keep those in mind.\"\n\nMy heart raced slightly as Rita returned to her pokemon.\n\nNow that I had seen Surskit demonstrate her moves, it was clear to me what needed focus. I had a strategy in mind, and it needed some serious work.",

            "content": "My plan required a few different components to work, but the first priority was to work on Surskit's offensive moves.\n\n\"Alright Surskit, I'm going to need your attention, okay?\"\n\n\"Surss!\"\n\n\"So you know how your bubble attack sort of went, well.. everywhere?\"\n\nSurskit looked at the ground, clearly thinking.\n\n\"What we want to do is get your bubbles to move in more of a straight line— like your water gun. I want you to try to use it again, but this time try to condense it more.\"\n\n\"Skktt-tt.\" My pokemon nodded.\n\nAgain, Surskit fired off a bout of bubbles, but they fizzled off in multiple directions.\n\n\"Hmm. What if we try to work on water gun first? We could try to get you used to the feeling of increasing the pressure and narrowing it's scope. Here, aim for that tree over there with your water gun again.\"\n\nSurskit jumped up, firing off her water gun at the nearby tree. The attack hit the tree in a sort of broad splash.\n\n\"I think I see what the issue is,\" Rita chimed in. \"Surskit needs to get used to building up the water's pressure.\"\n\n\"Thats probably why her bubbles go everywhere too.\" I agreed. \"Alright Surskit! Try holding in the water before you launch it. I want you to try to focus on building pressure, and make your mouth smaller when you shoot it.\"\n\n\"Surss-ki-tit-it!\"\n\nSurskit fired off another water gun, and this time the splash was marginally smaller.\n\n\"Good! Keep practicing that for a while, try to get the splash as small as you can!\"\n\nThe tiny bug seemed to beam. I felt lucky to have a partner pokemon that was such a hard worker.\n\nWhile Surskit worked on water gun, Oddish worked with Grimer to learn how to build up poison type energy. I suspected that Rita was looking to have Oddish learn Poison Powder.\n\nWhile our pokemon trained, I decided to put a different plan in motion.\n\n\"Rita, can you come here for a sec? I beckoned to my companion.\n\n\"Yeah, whats up?\"\n\n\"I think we should run laps while our pokemon train.\" I told her.\n\n\"No thanks.\" Rita smiled.\n\n\"But how can we call ourselves trainers if we don't train ourselves?\" I posited. \"It doesn't feel right to just do nothing while our pokemon work so hard. \"\n\n\"I'm not doing nothing,\" Rita started. \"I'm taking mental notes. Plus, we already had P.E. today. I'm not doing any more running than I have to.\"\n\nWith that Rita walked off, and continued to watch her pokemon train. Guess its just me then, I shrugged.\n\nAs much as I talked a big game about running laps, I was admittedly winded halfway through my second— but I pressed on, my eyes following Surskit as I jogged around the dirt arena. Once I had finished, I was surprised to see that Surskit had improved by impressive amount—especially considering that today was her first day training. There was definitely a ton more work to be done, but her repeated use of water gun had begun to make a small indent in the tree's bark, signaling that the blast radius of her attack was indeed getting smaller and more forceful.\n\nThis book's true home is on another platform. Check it out there for the real experience.\n\nBy the time the sun had begun to set, we decided to call it for the day.\n\nA week came and went, and Rita and I followed much the same routine. Our pokemon trained, I jogged, and she didn't.\n\nAs I walked from my afternoon class, I noticed a group of students crowding in the hallway. Curious, I went to see what all the hubbub had been about. As I pushed my way through, I was greeted by a long list of names and numbers pinned to a board. Our test results!\n\nI was pleased to find that Rita and I had faired reasonably well despite all that had transpired, since our names were listed somewhere around the middle-of-the-pack. Tom's name was listed just below my own. My mood immediately soured upon seeing Beatrice's name in the top spot, though I wasn't surprised.\n\nAs I made my way to our usual training spot, I noticed a battle taking place in the arena adjacent to it.\n\nTom and his Lotad squared off against the arrogant Chimchar trainer from the exams. I think his name was Liam?\n\n\"Lotad— water gun!\" Tom shouted, and the little lily pad-creature obeyed. The water gun surged forward, but Lotad's aim was off, and the move was easily dodged by his opponent.\n\n\"Chimchar, get in close!\" Liam commanded. \"Use scratch—Repeatedly!\"\n\nThe fiery chimp jumped up and landed in right Lotad's face, overwhelming him with scratches. Tom's Lotad cried out in pain as the attacks landed.\n\n\"Dodge, Lotad!\" Tom bellowed, but it was no use. Everywhere Lotad tried to dodge, Chimchar was there, refusing to let up in his assault.\n\n\"Good, keep overwhelming him!\" Liam cheered.\n\nTom stood, watching Chimchar's attacks land one after the other, but they were clearly becoming sluggish. Lotad was in a bad way, but had successfully held on long enough to tire Chimchar out.\n\n\"Lotad, water gun!\" Tom called again, seizing his opportunity. This time, Lotad's water gun fired off from point-blank range, hitting the monkey square in the chest.\n\nChimchar reeled back, panting. The repeated uses of scratch had taken their toll, along with the super-effective damage from Lotad's attack.\n\n\"Chimchar, are you KIDDING me? Finish him off!\" Liam shrieked. \"Use ember!\"\n\nI blinked in astonishment. Did he always talk to his pokemon like this?\n\nThough Chimchar's ember did little to hurt Lotad on account of his water typing, the small blast was just enough to send Lotad reeling back. Closing the gap, Chimchar got off a couple more scratches that sealed the deal— Lotad was down.\n\nTom's expression was unreadable as he returned his pokemon. \"Good match,\" he started, as he walked towards his opponent with an outstretched hand.\n\nLiam looked at Tom's hand, and back up to him. \"My winnings?\" Liam cocked his head.\n\nTom reached for his wallet, handing a few Pokedollars to his opponent. \"Here.\"\n\nWithout a word, Liam sauntered off— his exhausted Chimchar scrambling to follow behind him.\n\n\"That guy seems like a real winner,\" I remarked, as I approached Tom.\n\nTom's shoulder's slumped as he looked at the pokeball in his hand. \"He wasn't always like that.\"\n\n\"Is he your friend?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sort of— Well, he used to be. We grew up in the same area, so we went to elementary school together. Since he's gotten his Chimchar though, he's been acting different. He's won a bunch of battles, and I think it's going to his head.\"\n\n\"The way he treats his pokemon.. Is a bit concerning.\" Tom continued.\n\n\"Does he always act that way?\"\n\n\"Lately? Pretty much. We actually got into an argument about it because I said that he was pushing Chimchar too hard. He challenged me to a battle, and well... You saw how that went.\"\n\n\"So you've tried to talk to him already,\" I muttered.\n\n\"Well, yeah. He just doesn't listen to me, is all. That fight was his way of deciding who was right about it, if that makes any sense. In his eyes, I'm weak, so my opinion doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"You're not though,\" I started. \"That was a pretty close battle.\"\n\n\"He probably doesn't see it that way.\" Tom shrugged.\n\n\"Hrrm..\" I hummed, thinking for a moment. \"Why don't you come train with me and Rita?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"Yeah! You could come train with us until you feel confident enough to challenge Liam again.\"\n\n\"I—Uhm. Would Rita even be okay with that?\" The boy stammered.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure she would be. There's nothing Rita hates more than people who mistreat pokemon. Besides, Surskit could use a sparring partner.\"\n\n\"If you're sure its okay,\" Tom decided. \"Lotad and I could use the help.\"\n\n\"And maybe once you win, Liam will listen to some sense!\" I beamed.\n\nTom sighed. \"One can hope.\"",

            "content": "Tom stiffened as Rita approached our usual training spot.\n\n\"What's up?\" She asked, blowing a bubble with her chewing gum.\n\n\"Tom here wanted to know if it was okay if he joined us for training.\" I started.\n\n\"H-Hello,\" Tom fidgeted next to me. \"I don't believe we've met properly. I'm Tom.\"\n\n\"I've gathered.\" Rita replied in a clipped, but neutral tone. \"What's going on?\"\n\nTom cleared his throat sheepishly, before explaining the situation to Rita. The girl's expression darkened a bit at the mention of Liam mistreating his Chimchar.\n\n\"I see..\" Rita trailed off for a moment, seemingly lost in thought for a moment. \"..And why are we not beating this guy into the dirt right now?\"\n\n\"Figuratively, or literally?\" I asked.\n\n\"Take your pick.\"\n\n\"Ah-ah- Figuratively please!\" Tom sputtered. \"He's still my friend! He just.. isn't acting like himself lately.\"\n\nRita gave him a searching glance for a moment.\n\n\"So you want to beat him so that he listens to you and takes it easier on Chimchar, then?\"\n\n\"That... about sums it up, yeah.\" Tom sighed.\n\n\"Well, I'm on board. Give that guy a good kick in teeth.\" Rita gave Tom a thumbs up. \"Does your Lotad still need patching up? I've got some supplies on me.\"\n\n\"Yes— Thank-you so much!\" Tom responded. \"I really appreciate it.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it.\" Rita replied. \"Seriously, don't. I don't want people thinking I'm doing charity work.\"\n\n\"Oh, haha. Okay.\" Tom gave Rita a nervous laugh.\n\nRita quickly set to work tending to Lotad with a couple of spray-potions she had in her bag. Within minutes, the proof of Lotad's previous fight faded. She even gave him a spare Oran Berry she had, as a treat. Once Lotad recovered, we immediately got down to business with our training.\n\nOut of curiosity, I pulled out my pokedex and aimed it at Tom's Lotad.\n\n\"Lotad—The Water Weed Pokemon. A Grass/Water type. Lotad lives in ponds and lakes with clean water. Lotad are generally seen as a benevolent pokemon, as they are sometimes known to ferry small pokemon that cannot swim across water.\"\n\nHitting the side button, I pulled up the more specific information I wanted to know.\n\nUnauthorized content usage: if you discover this narrative on Amazon, report the violation.\n\n\"Lotad— Juvenille, Male. Ability: Rain Dish\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" I hummed.\n\n\"Something wrong?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"No— I was just curious about what ability Lotad has. Seems like both of our pokemon have rain abilities.\"\n\n\"What's Surskit's ability?\"\n\n\"Swift Swim. At first I thought it had something to do with swimming, but it actually makes her faster during rain. I don't think it rains often enough here for it to really be useful, though—Unless..\" I trailed off.\n\n\"Unless?\" Tom quirked a brow.\n\n\"Unless we got our pokemon to learn Rain Dance. I'm pretty sure they both can learn it, but that's probably a ways off. For now, we're better off training Water Gun.\"\n\nTom nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"Can you get Lotad to use Water Gun real quick for me? Surskit and I have been practicing on that tree over there.\" I pointed at the tree.\n\n\"Sure. Hey Lotad, could you use water gun on that tree?\" Tom asked his pokemon in a gentle tone.\n\n\"Tad!\" The pokemon squawked happily, before launching a water gun that missed the tree entirely.\n\n\"So, aim is something to work on!\" I chuckled. The pokemon seemed to give me the equivalent of a sheepish shrug.\n\n\"Don't worry Lotad, you're probably just nervous.\" Tom assured his kappa-like friend. \"Try it again for me, okay buddy?\"\n\nThe pokemon gave a nod, again launching a water gun that this time met its mark. The attack hit the tree in a broad splash, much how Surskit's water gun did when we had started training.\n\n\"Okay, so let me show you something.\" I started. \"Surskit, your turn! Hit the tree for me, okay?\"\n\n\"Skiiit!\" She trilled, launching a water gun of her own. Surskit's water gun hit the tree in more of a 'jet'— similar to a strong garden hose, but with an overall more focused blast. Upon seeing her work, Surskit gave Lotad a triumphant look. She was definitely gloating a little.\n\n\"Easy there, hotshot.\" I smiled, giving my pokemon a pat on the head. \"We still have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nSurskit jerked her head away from me in a playful \"Harumph!\" like motion.\n\nTom stepped toward the tree, before running his fingers over the small divot Surskit had made. \"I see.\"\n\n\"We've been working on narrowing the scope of Surskit's water gun little by little,\" I spoke evenly, trying to temper the pride in my voice. \"By making the blast smaller, it seems Surskit is able to put a little more force behind it.\"\n\n\"Sound like something you wanna try, bud?\" Tom asked.\n\nLotad looked from Tom, to the tree, and back. \"Lo-oh!\" The pokemon croaked with dubious optimism.\n\nAfter training on the tree for a bit, we decided to have a bit of a mock-battle to work on our pokemon's aim. Since Rita's pokemon had been training together almost exclusively on account of their shared typing, Tom's prescence presented us with a unique opportunity to get some sparring in.\n\n\"Lotad, water gun!\" Tom ordered.\n\n\"Ta-ad!\" The little lily-pad creature croaked, firing off a water gun that went wide, and was easily side-stepped by Surskit.\n\n\"Aim for where you think she's going to be, not where she is!\" He called.\n\n\"Keep dodging, Surskit.\" I smiled.\n\nOne by one, Lotad kept firing off water guns that failed to meet their mark. To his credit, he was progressively getting closer— but Surskit is a decently speedy little bug. Just as it looked as though she was about to be hit, she would effortlessly stepped out of the way.\n\nUntil she didn't.\n\nI don't know if maybe Surskit was getting cocky or bored from dodging attacks, but eventually Lotad succeeded, hitting her square in the face.\n\n\"YES! Great job, Lotad!\" Tom cheered.\n\n\"Skkiiit!\" Surskit hissed, before firing off a water gun of her own without it being ordered. The water gun zipped through the air before hitting its mark, sending Lotad reeling back a few inches.\n\n\"Hey! Easy, Surskit.\" I chided her, and she looked up at me with an apologetic glance. My little bug had an attitude problem— and she was done being target practice.\n\n\"Sorry, I think she's a bit cranky because its almost dinner time,\" I looked to Tom. \"I think we should call it there for today.\"\n\n\"No worries— and, agreed. Lotad has had a long day, and I don't want to push him too hard.\"",

            "content": "I don't know what I expected. I knew I couldn't avoid it forever, but no matter how much time passed, I still didn't feel ready.\n\nUpon returning to the dorm building I was informed by the dorm manager—A rather nervous looking older woman—that there was a call for me.\n\nMy heart thumped wildly in my chest as I made my way to the video-phone terminal. I looked over my shoulder a few times to make sure nobody was near—I was sure to get chewed out for not calling sooner, and I preferred not to be overheard.\n\nSucking in a sharp breath, I dialed the number and waited for my call to connect.\n\n\"Ding dong ding...~Click!\"\n\n\"Hello?\" Florian appeared on the screen, concern written on his face.\n\n\"Hey Florian, I'm sorry that I haven't—\"\n\n\"Pep!—\" Florian adjusted his tone to a whisper. \"Its good to see you Pep, but you have about five seconds.\"\n\n\"Oh god.\" I sighed, mentally preparing myself.\n\n\"PEPPA CARMINE! IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS AND YOU HAVEN'T BOTHERED TO CALL?!\" Mother's voice came screeching through the line before I could see her on the screen.\n\nAs expected I received a proper earful; I must have apologized twenty times before Mother finally calmed down. Once she did, I was able to catch her up on most of the happenings since arriving at the academy, save for some specifics I intentionally omitted. She listened intently, but her brows remained knit in evident frustration with me.\n\n\"So are you going to show us your pokemon?\" Mother huffed.\n\n\"I want to see!\" Florian squeezed in beside her.\n\nI froze for a moment, remembering the reactions some of my fellow classmates had to Surskit. What would they say knowing I caught a bug as my first partner?\n\nI gave my head a shake. This was my parnter. Whatever they thought didn't matter—I was proud to be Surskit's trainer, and I needed to act like it. Steeling myself, I unclipped Surskit's pokeball and released her.\n\n\"Skiit!\" My bug excitedly trilled, clearly expecting dinner.\n\n\"No, not yet, Surskit. Theres someone I want you to meet, first.\"\n\nI held out my arm, and Surskit climbed up and onto my shoulder. With a deep breath, I turned around for Florian and Mother to see.\n\n\"Mother, Florian— This is Surskit,\" I started. \"Surskit, this is my mother, and my brother Florian. Remember when we talked about family? They are a part of mine.\"\n\n\"Aww, its adorable!\" Florian cooed at my bug.\n\nSurskit eyed Florian's image on the screen with clear disinterest. Normally I would have expected her to preen under praise, but she must have just been too hungry to care.\n\n\"Ah, a surskit.\" Mother spoke in a clipped tone. \"We have many of those here.\"\n\nI cringed.\n\n\"You see them often when it rains... Say, Peppa dear.. Have you caught any other pokemon by chance?\" Mother's expression betrayed a hint of concern.\n\n\"Not yet.. Why?\" I quirked a brow at her.\n\n\"Well, uhm.\" Mother cleared her throat. \"It might serve you well to catch, well— a different pokemon. Preferably before..\" Mother's voice trailed off.\n\nStolen from its rightful author, this tale is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\n\n\"What do you mean? What's wrong with Surskit?\" I asked, growing irritated.\n\nSurskit glanced at the screen and back at me, her expression unreadable.\n\n\"Well, nothing, dear. I'm sure Surskit is perfectly lovely, but—\" Mother froze for a moment, Looking away from the screen.\n\n\"I'm sorry dear, forget what I was saying. Your father would like to speak with you.\"\n\nI took a deep breath as Mother and Florian stepped out of the frame, and Father appeared, sitting down with his arms crossed.\n\n\"Peppa, nice of you to call.\" He rumbled out, his deep voice dripping with disdain. \"I see you've caught a pokemon for yourself.\"\n\n\"Y-yes, Father. This is Surskit.\" my voice came out in something of a squeak. \"Surskit, this is my Father.\"\n\nLooking over at the pokemon on my shoulder, I noticed Surskit's gaze had remained fixed on me.\n\nFor a few moments, Father simply stared at me, seemingly lost in thought.\n\n\"Father?\" I asked, anxiety burning in my lungs.\n\n\"I would like for you to explain to me,\" He started, \"Why you've chosen a bug for your partner pokemon.\"\n\nI swallowed hard.\n\n\"I don't understand your question.\"\n\nFather's brows furrowed deeply, and for a moment I swore his eyes matched his fire-red hair.\n\n\"Let me rephrase my question. Would you care to explain to me, why you've not only selected a bug— But a bug you could have found in our back yard, no less?\"\n\n\"I-I—\" I stammered.\n\n“You don’t need to answer. Just listen. Since you seem to have forgotten, in two weeks’ time there will be a tournament held at your school. There will be many eyes on all such tournaments, including those of sponsors. I expect you to find a pokemon more suited to our name, and to not deliberately embarrass the people who put you in that school. Do I make myself clear?”\n\n\"But-\"\n\n\"Good. I look forward to seeing you win.\"\n\nBefore I could object, Father stalked off, leaving Mother and Florian standing behind the screen, looking clearly disquieted.\n\nThe rest of the call was a blur.\n\n\"Augh!\" I yelled, kicking at the air. \"He didn't even let me get a word in!\"\n\nSurskit looked to me, and back to the video-phone terminal— Before 'punching' at the screen with her feet.\n\n\"Wait, Surskit— What are you doing?\" I stood bewildered as my little bug harmlessly assailed the machine.\n\n\"Skit! Skit!\" She hissed with each strike.\n\n\"Oh, I get it. You don't like the machine because it made me sad?\"\n\n\"Surs!\" She nodded, before returning to her assault.\n\nI couldn't help but smile. At least you have my back.\n\nOnce again, I lifted Surskit up and back onto my shoulder.\n\n\"There's someone else I want you to meet, and I think you will like him.\"\n\nSurskit grunted out her annoyance.\n\nOnce again, I dialed a familiar number.\n\n\"Ding dong ding...~ Ding dong ding..~ Click!\"\n\n\"Who is this and how did you get my number?!\" Grandpa chuckled, stroking his beard.\n\n\"Its your favorite grandchild!\" I answered.\n\n\"Favorite grandchild? I don't have one of those.\" He rolled his eyes playfully.\n\n\"Sure you don't Grandpa.\" I laughed. \"Anyways, theres someone I want you to meet. Say hi, Surskit.\" I gently nudged my pokemon.\n\n\"Skiit!\" Surskit hissed at the machine once again.\n\n\"Ohoh, a Surskit— And a feisty one too.\" Grandpa's voice rumbled as he adjusted his glasses. \"Interesting choice, bean-sprout.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I groaned. \"I already got an earful from Father.\"\n\nGrandpa winced.\n\n\"I can imagine. How are you holding up, dear?\"\n\n\"Honestly? I'm angry. Surskit is an amazing pokemon, but everyone keeps writing her off as just 'a bug'. I don't understand what the issue is with bugs to begin with.\" I huffed.\n\n\"Well, they are generally regarded as the worst type, hun.\"\n\n\"What? Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"You see, bugs enjoy earlier evolutions than most pokemon; and for that reason they can be good for beginners, but once they evolve, that's it. There isn't much room for growth later down the line, so they often get passed up in favor of stronger pokemon. They're also usually pretty frail compared to others, and have quite a number of weaknesses.\"\n\nFrom what I remembered of Pokemon games from Earth, what Grandpa was saying was true, but only half the story in my eyes. Even back in my old world, I had always been of the belief that any pokemon could be good as long as you used them correctly. While bug-types weren't always a 'meta' pick, they could quite often be very solid depending on how you built them and the rest of your team. The amount of disdain people had here for bug-types seemed wildly disproportionate to me.\n\nBut game knowledge aside, this was a real, thinking and feeling creature. To me, competitive viability was much less important than the bond I had with Surskit. She could be the weakest pokemon, and her feelings would still matter. The way that people disregarded her on account of her rarity and typing truly had begun to make my blood boil.\n\n\"..I think all pokemon are good pokemon.\" I sighed.\n\n\"I know, bean-sprout. Don't worry. I'm sure Surskit will make a fantastic partner.\" Grandpa winked.\n\nWith that, we talked a bit more before saying our goodbyes. It was getting late, and I didn't think Surskit would abide my chatting any longer.",

            "content": "As I laid in bed, I replayed the conversations I had with my family over and over in my head— I was doubtful that sleep would find me tonight. Not only had father called Surskit an embarrassment, but there was also a tournament supposedly coming up that I was expected to win. How Father knew, I simply chalked up to connections.\n\nIf Father was to be believed, catching another pokemon may soon become paramount. Rita, Claire, and Beatrice all had two pokemon as far as I was aware, and within two weeks time, the rest of the class would no doubt follow suit. While I knew I needed to start giving my next capture some thought, there was no way I would be giving in to Father's demands and replacing Surskit. Absolutely out of the question— I would just have to train hard and show everyone how awesome Surskit is.\n\nThere was also my conversation with Grandpa to consider. He was right—Bug types do tend to evolve much earlier than other pokemon, and though I had no way of knowing how far off an evolution for Surskit would be, it would serve me well to be prepared.\n\nOnce Surskit evolved, she would become a Masquerain, and thus lose her Water typing— becoming a Bug/Flying type instead. Assuming things worked similarly to the Pokemon games, (which from what I had seen so far, I had to assume they did,) this meant that she would lose her 'STAB' (Same Type Attack Bonus) for water gun. That isn't to say she wouldn't be able to use it anymore, but it would likely see a significant decrease in damage. That said, having a reliable counter to fire types in a pinch would no doubt be invaulable once she lost her water typing, anyways.\n\nEither way, it was time for Surskit to begin training a different move now. I wasn't sure what moves Surskit could learn off the top of my head, so for now, I settled on possibly training quick attack, and maybe even working on her bubble attack as well. Hopefully with any luck, there would be a move that saw Surskit utilizing her bug-type energy that we could work on, but that would require some studying on my part.\n\nWith a plan in mind, I tossed and turned a bit longer before finally drifting off to sleep.\n\nClasses sped by the next day, as I spent most of the day lost in thoughts of training. There was still the problem of capturing another pokemon, but I decided that I would go looking during the upcoming weekend. Today was Thursday, so that gave me enough time to study and hopefully find Surskit a new move to practice first. I let Rita and Tom know that I would be busy today, so after classes finished, I made my way to the school's library.\n\nThe library was an impressive sight, and served as a staunch reminder of the school's winding history. Rows and rows of bookshelves went on nearly as far as I could see, and in the center of the library stood an impressively embellished fireplace—almost on the verge of being gaudy—though it wasn't currently lit on account of it still being summer. The library also featured a few tables, as well as more private study nooks that hugged the walls of the room. Upon entering, I made my way to a front desk where a rather bookish looking girl sat behind a computer.\n\nStolen from its rightful place, this narrative is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\n\n\"Hello, need any help finding anything today?\" She asked, not looking up from her screen.\n\n\"Oh, uh. If you could just point me in the direction of books on bug-type pokemon?\" I replied.\n\nFor a moment, it was silent, save for the girl's rapid clicking at her keyboard.\n\n\"All type-based reference materials are divided up in their own sections, you'll find them over there.\" She pointed.\n\n\"Thank-you.\" I gave her a nod, and made my way over to the types section.\n\nUpon finding the bug-type section, I thumbed my way through a few different titles before landing on one that interested me— A dusty old journal that seemed to be a trainer's record of training bug type pokemon. I also grabbed a book on known bug types, and found my way towards one of the study nooks.\n\nAdmittedly, I probably could have looked through the pokedex, but as it was a newer invention at this time, I expected I'd find more information by reading the old fashioned way. It wasn't too long ago that all pokedexes were on paper, anyways.\n\nI flipped through the hard-cover book on bug types until I landed on Surskit's entry.\n\nThe book had all the information the pokedex had relayed to me, as well as some other interesting trivia. At the bottom of the page was a section with Surskit's known moves.\n\nThe section read:\n\nSurskit's Known Moves:\n\nWater Gun\n\nQuick Attack\n\nSweet Scent\n\nSoak\n\nBubble Beam\n\nAgility\n\nMist\n\nHaze\n\nBaton Pass\n\nSticky Web\n\nI sucked my teeth. I had hoped for a wider selection of bug type moves, but I supposed this gave us enough to aim for at the moment.\n\nOn the next page, there was a list of moves learnable by Technical Machine that featured a few moves that caught my eye: Struggle Bug, and Bug Buzz namely. TM's did exist in this world, but they were a bit beyond my means at the moment— I had heard of some selling for nearly 40,000 Pokedollars a piece. I made a mental note to myself to look into TMs later, presumably once I had a sponsor; and wrote down the list of learnable moves on a sheet of paper.\n\nFlipping through the dusty journal, it seemed to contain the accounts of a trainer from decades ago that trained exclusively bug-type pokemon. The trainer's journal entries consisted of their general day to day, as well as some other information here and there on bug-type nutrition and other random bits of information. I was just about to put the book back when something caught my eye— an entry about the author catching a surskit. While having battled the surskit, there was mention of the pokemon having used a move similar to bite.\n\nI looked back at my written list of Surskit's learnable moves, and found no mention of bite. Flipping back to the hard cover book, there was mention of Bug Bite being one of the learnable moves by TM.\n\nThe bug-trainer's journal seemed pretty clear that this was a wild Surskit though, and I wasn't even sure how long TMs had existed for in this world, for that matter.\n\nA grin stretched across my face. Perhaps there was a way for Surskit to learn a bug move without a TM, after all.",

            "content": "When I arrived at our usual training spot, Rita was already there with her two pokemon. Well, I say two—Grimer seemed to be lazily watching Oddish train. Despite the steely determination he had shown against the wild Gabite, it seemed Grimer had little interest in doing anything that didn't involve eating garbage during his day to day.\n\nI had pointed this out to Rita once, to which she responded: \"Eating pollutants is part of Grimer's job, it helps protect the natural order.\"\n\nStill, the impressive little blob creature did save my life, so I was all for the little guy getting as much garbage as he could stuff himself with. He seemed to be thoroughly content with it, with Rita taking him out to the dumpsters every day after school let out so he could feast.\n\nI said \"Hi\" to Rita and set to work training with Surskit. Tom was notably absent, so I figured either he was busy or would be coming later. Either way, I went ahead and got cracking.\n\n\"Okay Surskit, you know how you channel water-type energy to use water gun? I want you to try to do that, but with bug-type energy. Try focusing it around your mouth.\"\n\nSurskit looked up at me, befuddled.\n\n\"I know, I know. Just try it.\" I gave my bug a pat on the head.\n\nSurskit stood stone-still with eyes shut tight for a few moments, before giving a quiet \"Puuhhh,\" sound as if she had been holding her breath.\n\n\"Hmm, Okay.\" I started. \"Rita, I may need your help for this.\"\n\n\"Yeah? What do you need?\"\n\n\"Do you think Grimer would be okay with being bitten?\" I cringed a bit as the words came out.\n\n\"What?\" Rita stared at me in her expressionless manner.\n\n\"I'm trying to get Surskit to learn bug-bite, but I think she needs to practice it on something. I didn't want to ask Oddish to do it, because if she succeeds it will be super-effective damage.\" I responded.\n\n\"So you decided the poisonous blob was the better choice?\" Rita asked, quirking an eyebrow.\n\nSurskit looked at Grimer, and than back to me with a dubious look.\n\n\"When you put it like that, it does sound silly.\" I facepalmed.\n\n\"Here, I have a better idea.\" Rita said, reaching into a large backpack on the ground beside her. After digging for a few moments, she produced a small plushie of a Chansey. I fought the urge to smile.\n\n\"Don't say anything. We were giving them out at the Pokecenter.\" Rita glowered.\n\n\"Is that where the one on your bed came from?\"\n\nRita punched me in the arm, which admittedly hurt a lot. I chuckled my thanks before placing the doll in front of Surskit.\n\n\"Okay Surskit. I want you to bite the doll.\"\n\n\"Surs?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know it sounds weird. Just trust me, okay?\"\n\nThis book was originally published on Royal Road. Check it out there for the real experience.\n\nSurskit gave me an adorable little nod, before taking a few steps forward. She gave the doll a small chomp, and looked up at me expectantly.\n\n\"Good!\" I praised her. \"So what I want you to do is to try to gather bug-type energy again, around your mouth if you can— and then bite the doll.\"\n\nSurskit tilted her head at me slightly as I spoke, but quickly set to work with another attempt.\n\nAgain, she stood stock-still before giving a quiet sputter.\n\n\"That's okay! Keep trying!\"\n\nIt wasn't for a few dozen attempts that anything different happened. For a moment, a bright green energy coalesced around Surskit's mouth, but quickly petered out before she could do anything with it.\n\n\"Great job!\" I cheered, scooping my tired bug into my arms.\n\n\"Skiiit.\" Surskit weakly batted her legs at my face in mock protest, before allowing herself to go limp in my grasp. Focusing bug-type energy took a lot more out of her than I would have expected, given the fact that she is a bug-type. I decided that my little bug had earned herself a break twice over.\n\nSurskit and I watched Rita's pokemon train for a bit, while Surskit munched on some berries. While we watched, Tom arrived a heaving mess— profusely apologizing for having been late.\n\n“I-I’m so sorry. I went… to the library… after classes and… lost track of time.” He sputtered, clutching at his knees.\n\n\"Hey, relax! Surskit and I were just taking a break.\" I gave him a pat on the back.\n\n\"What did I miss?\" Tom straightened, catching his breath.\n\n\"I'm trying to have Surskit learn a new move— Bug-bite. It was slow going at first, but I think we're making some progress.\"\n\n\"Thats great! I was actually reading up on moves for Lotad. When you said you were going to the library yesterday, I figured it would be a good idea to do some research myself.\"\n\n\"Find anything?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not a lot, no. Most of the moves were TM moves, and I doubt I could convince my parents to give me what I'd need for it. For now I think I'll have Lotad train the moves he already knows.\"\n\nAfter chatting a bit longer, Tom set to training with Lotad. Once Surskit had recovered, I decided to make one last push with Surskit's training for the day.\n\nOn the next attempt, the bug-type energy seemed to come a bit easier, after about a minute of Surskit focusing. Once again, it petered out before she could move.\n\nSurskit looked at the ground, seemingly dejected.\n\n\"Hey, its okay, buddy.\" I assured her. \"I didn't expect it would be easy. We just need to keep trying.\"\n\n\"Surs.\" Surskit gave a curt grunt.\n\n\"Don't be like that.\" I kneeled down in front of Surskit to look her in the eyes. \"This is a move you normally wouldn't learn this way, so we're experimenting a bit. I promise that you're doing great. Plus, if you succeed, that'll mean you're in the top percentage of Surskit!\" I gave my bug a wink.\n\n\"Skiit-ti-tit!\" Surskit beamed at me with newfound fire in her eyes.\n\nThe next attempt saw marked improvement, with Surskit's charging time decreasing by about half. This time, she managed to take a few steps towards the doll before losing grip on the energy.\n\nWith each subsequent attempt, Surskit seemed to redouble her efforts. She wanted to be in the top percentage of Surskit, and she wanted it bad.\n\nAfter another thirty minutes or so, Surskit had finally done it— With wobbling legs, she managed to land a bite on the doll. Unfortunately, the energy dissipated just as she chomped down.\n\n\"SKKT-T-TT!\" Surskit hissed in frustration. If I spoke pokemon, I'm sure I would have heard some choice words from my little menace.\n\nI made sure to praise her plenty before packing up for the day.\n\nThe next day saw a veritable downpour from the skies. Rita informed me that it would rain for the rest of the day, so while she decided to stay indoors and study, I decided this was a prime time to train with Surskit. In the rain, Surskit would be in her element, after all. I donned a my bright yellow rain poncho, and made my way for the training field.\n\nMy feet made wet shlooping sounds as I trudged my way through the muddy training field. All of the plots were empty save for one— our usual training spot.\n\nTom stood in the rain thoroughly soaked through, as his Lotad dutifully trained with more vim and vigor than I had seen from him prior.\n\n\"That's it, Lotad! Water gun, again!\" Tom called.\n\nLotad's water gun shot out at the tree in a condensed jet, successfully making the divot in the tree's bark that much deeper.\n\nI gave a steady clap as I approached.\n\nJumping slightly, Tom turned to me. \"I didn't see you there, Pep.\"\n\n\"Sorry if I started you. Lotad's water gun looks great!\" I shouted slightly over the rain.\n\nFor a moment, Tom stood silently as the rain bounced off his coat.\n\n“Pep, can I battle you?”",

            "content": "Tom and I squared off at opposite ends of the muddy arena. I didn't know why Tom was so intent on battling, but I wasn't going to pass up the perfect opportunity to test out Surskit's Swift Swim ability.\n\nWith a trill, my bug appeared on the battlefield opposite Tom's Lotad.\n\nSince we didn't have a referee, we agreed to begin on the count of three.\n\n\"One..\n..Two..\n..Three!\"\n\n\"Lotad, astonish!\" Tom was the first to issue his order.\nLotad bounded forward, but before he could get within striking distance, Surskit was already off— zipping around him with relative ease.\n\n\"Great! Surskit, use quick attack!\" I called.\nSurskit glided across the wet ground like a figure skater, zipping around Lotad in a circle before landing a direct hit that saw Lotad staggering backwards.\n\n\"Keep it up!\" I cheered. With an effortless grace, Surskit zigged and zagged across the battlefield, landing one blow after the other. Lotad didn't have a moment to react before Surskit was already behind him from another angle, ready to bowl him over.\n\nTruthfully, I felt a little bad. That was until I saw Tom smile.\n\nFor a moment I was confused, as it seemed as though Surskit was steamrolling Lotad with little resistance— but then I remembered Lotad's ability.\n\nWhile Surskit had been exerting energy with every blow, Lotad's Rain Dish had been continuously healing him. At this rate, Surskit would exhaust herself before Lotad would fall.\n\nTom must have planned for this.\n\n\"Surskit, we're changing gears! Conserve your energy!\"\n\nSurskit skidded to a halt opposite her opponent, panting slightly. Sure enough, she was winded.\n\n\"Don't give her time to rest! Absorb!\" Tom fired back.\n\nDeep green energy coalesced around both pokemon for a moment, marking Lotad's absorb as a clean hit. Within seconds, a fraction of Surskit's energy had been drained from her, while Lotad looked healthier than ever.\n\nI sucked my teeth. The attack itself wasn't super-effective, but Tom knew Surskit was tired and used it to his advantage.\n\nThe author's tale has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.\n\nAs Surskit wobbled slightly, Tom once again pressed the attack.\n\n\"Astonish!\" Tom shouted over the intensifying rain. \"Don't let her recover!\"\n\nOnce again, Lotad bounded forward, this time meeting his mark. Surskit staggered backward, flinching from the sudden attack. Before Surskit could regain her bearings, Lotad hit her again. This cycle repeated a couple more times, and Surskit was definitely looking worse for wear.\n\n\"Surskit, you have to break away from him! Use quick attack to get some distance!\"\n\nAs Surskit attempted to dart away, Lotad for once was faster. Another absorb landed, serving to exhaust Surskit even further.\n\nSurskit's quick attack unfortunately saw her skidding face first into the mud.\n\n\"Surskit, are you okay?!\" I cried.\n\n\"Ss..Skit!\" Surskit once again rose on shaking legs. She wasn't out of the fight just yet.\n\n\"If you're sure.\" I gave my bug a nod.\n\n\"Lotad, lets finish this!\" Tom once again shouted with an uncharacteristic determination.\n\nSurskit stood motionless as Lotad once again began to close in. Just as he came within striking distance, a yellow-green energy began to coalesce around Surskit's mouth.\n\nShe was going to try to land a bug-bite.\n\n\"Wait for it-\" I ordered. \"Now! You can do it Surskit!\"\n\nWith a snap, the previously still bug got right in Lotad's face, chomping down hard on the brim of his lily-pad 'hat'.\n\nLotad staggered backward with a cry, having taken serious damage from the super-effective move.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, Surskit had successfully pulled off a bug-bite. But there was no time to celebrate just yet.\n\n\"Lotad, get some distance and absorb!\" Tom shouted, looking shaken from the unexpected turn.\n\n\"Don't let him! Quick attack, into bug-bite!\"\n\nWith renewed confidence, Surskit once again zipped across the battlefield, sending water spraying in a trail behind her.\n\nThere was precious little Lotad could do as Surskit came careening into him. With another snap, Surskit once again chomped down on Lotad, and this time the attack saw him fall.\n\n\"Lotad, no!\" Tom cried, rushing to his friend's side.\n\n\"You did it Surskit!\" I cheered. \"You're in the top percentage of Surskit, for sure!\"\n\nSurskit trilled triumphantly, pumping a 'foot' in the air, before staggering forward. The fight had taken a lot out of her.\n\n\"Get some good rest, okay?\" I smiled, returning my partner to her pokeball. When I turned around, Tom had done the same.\n\n\"That was a close fight,\" I said as I approached my friend. \"Is Lotad okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah, he's alright.\" Tom spoke without looking at me.\n\n\"Good match.\" I extended my hand out to Tom with a grin. \"I think our pokemon both fought well!\"\n\nTom sighed, before giving my hand a shake.\n\n\"Good match.\" He replied weakly.\n\nThere was an awkward pause as Tom looked at Lotad's pokeball.\n\n\"Uhm.. Are you okay?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yeah, sorry Pep. I just.. I wanted to make sure I was ready to take on Liam and his Chimchar, but now I'm not so sure.\" Tom's shoulders slumped with a heavy sigh.\n\n\"Are you kidding? You did great! If it weren't for Surskit working out bug-bite at the last second, you would have won for sure.\" I gave Tom a pat on the shoulder.\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Totally. Theres no way Surskit would have been able to dish out enough damage. Your strategy of waiting to tire her out really paid off!\"\n\nTom gave me a weak smile.\n\n\"Alright. Thank-you, Pep. Really.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. But lets get out of the rain before we both catch a cold.\"",

I think people would underestimate how hard it is to hit a small and fast target, so hopefully in future battles Surskit can surprise her opponents by being really good dodging and weaving between their attacks\n\nOne thing I found a bit odd about the battle is how many attacks Surskit managed to tank. Specifically, according to this paragraph here-\n\nOnce again, Lotad bounded forward, this time meeting his mark. Surskit staggered backward, flinching from the sudden attack. Before Surskit could regain her bearings, Lotad hit her again. This cycle repeated a couple more times, and Surskit was definitely looking worse for wear.\n\n-Surskit took at minimum four Astonish attacks.\nAt least four Astonishes, plus two Absorbs, seems like a bit too much damage considering Surskit isn't really that bulky.\n\nI don't want to come off as mean, so let me know if advice like this is something you do or don't want in the future.\n\nLooking forward to upcoming chapters, I believe in Surskit's determination to win their future fights!!",

I think that this is a valid point.\n\nWhat I wanted was for Surskit to be backed into a corner, and desperate enough to try a move she wasn't sure she could pull off. That said, when writing this section I had failed to consider that Surskit only has a base health of 40. I'm thinking she's probably around the levels of 12~15, so she would only have roughly 50 HP or so total.\n\nOnce again, thank-you so much for bringing this up! I'll try to consider HP values more in the future :)",

            "content": "Tom and I went our separate ways once we made it back to the campus. On my walk back to the dorm, I started thinking. It was concerning how important the battle seemed to him, though I admit it was also bit comforting to know that I wasn't the only one feeling anxious about battling. Upon returning to the dorm, I removed my wet shoes and coat and hung them up to dry.\n\n\"Rita?\" I called.\n\nNo response. I wondered where she had gotten off to.\n\nAfter a shower and some warm pajamas, I flopped onto my bed with a huff. Lately I had found it rare to be alone with my thoughts, but as I settled into the silence of the room, I realized that there was a lot on my mind.\n\nThoughts of the upcoming tournament fought for dominance among others— capturing a new pokemon, my family's expectations, Surskit's success with bug-bite, having been almost been killed by a wild pokemon weeks prior, and so on.\n\nNot to mention the whole, \"Being reborn in the world of pokemon,\" thing. I usually did my best to avoid thinking about that at all, instead opting to focus on the life in front of me— but in quiet moments like these, it was hard not to at least a little.\n\nWhere I once had been a sick kid rotting away in a hospital room, I now was the future heiress of the Carmine family estate— and an honest-to-god pokemon trainer. That certainly came with a fair amount of whiplash, even after seventeen years.\n\nI sighed deeply, clutching my pillow tightly in my arms.\n\nThere was nothing for it. For now, I would do what I had always done and focus on the present moment. What could I do in the short term?\n\nOne thing was certain; I needed to catch my next pokemon.\n\nI had a few ideas already on how I could find one.\n\nRoute 204, (where I had caught Surskit,) was situated in the middle of Jubilife City and Floroma Town. Though in the games it was much smaller and less wooded, one thing stayed the same— it was host to many different pokemon. If I weren't restricted by time and transportation, I would have opted for the Eterna Forest, but the winding route would do just fine for my purposes.\n\nWith that in mind, I decided to prepare for tomorrow's excursion.\n\nThe following day, the torrential rain had fortunately let up. The walk to Route 204 had been much more pleasant than I remembered. I hadn't made much note prior of the brilliantly colored flowers and berry bushes that littered the trail— but now I had the time to fully appreciate them. I took in a deep breath, savoring the floral scents mixed with that of morning dew.\n\nBreaking off the trail, I returned to the site where the exams had been held. There was no trace left of the impressive shimmering dome that had been erected by the researcher's psychic pokemon. I wished I had gotten the chance to ask more questions about that.\n\nMoving on, I continued to press on through the sparse forest. It was time to put my plan to the test.\n\nIn the Pokemon games, Sinnoh featured a unique way to find and capture pokemon— Slathering honey on trees and waiting for wild pokemon to take the bait. In the games, this method was introduced as a way for the player to attact rare and unique encounters. I wasn't sure that I would find anything particularly rare today, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try. For the purposes of my experiment, I had purchased a bottle of Florama brand honey earlier this morning.\n\nEventually I came across a large tree I felt was a suitable test subject, and got to work slathering the sweet, golden honey across its bark. Once finished, I unclipped Surskit's pokeball from my belt and released her.\n\n\"Skii-iiit.\" Surskit yawned, stretching her legs out.\n\n\"Good morning, Surskit!\"\n\n\"...Surs?\" Surskit blinked with bleary eyes, taking in the surrounding area.\n\nIf you spot this narrative on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\n\n\"Thats right, we're back where we met,\" I gave her a gentle pat on the head. \"Can you guess what we're doing here?\"\n\nSurskit stared up at me silently, before giving a confused trill.\n\n\"We're catching another team member!\" I beamed.\n\n\"Skii-iit?\"\n\n\"Don't you want another friend to play and train with?\" I asked.\n\nSurskit hopped up and down excitedly. \"Surs! Skit-ti-tit!\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" I smiled at her. \"Could you help me out with something then?\"\n\nSurskit tilted her head inquisitively.\n\n\"I need you to use sweet scent for me, do you think you could do that?\"\n\nSurskit nodded in the affirmative, and after she concentrated for a few moments, an almost sickly sweet-smelling scent filled the air.\n\n\"Great, now come over here.\" I motioned for Surskit to follow.\n\nCrouching down, Surskit and I hid behind some nearby bushes. Now, it was time to wait.\n\nAfter about an hour, Surskit grew bored of fiddling with twigs and leaves, and curled up for a nap. As I watched my pokemon sleep soundly beside me, my own eyelids began to grow heavy. A few times I felt my gaze drifting downwards, before snapping back to the tree.\n\nI slapped myself on the cheeks to shock myself back into wakefulness. Today was going to be a long day.\n\nI gasped as my eyes snapped open to the sound of chittering.\n\nSomething was eating the honey.\n\nI clamped a hand over my mouth hoping whatever it was hadn't heard me. With a gentle nudge, I shook Surskit awake and placed a finger over my mouth in a 'Shh' motion.\n\n\"Surrs?\" Surskit yawned, not taking the hint.\n\nThe chittering noise stopped. I held my breath for a few seconds, until the sound resumed.\n\n\"When I do this,\" I made the 'Shh' signal again. \"It means be quiet.\" I whispered.\n\nSurskit gave me a curt nod.\n\nPeaking over the bushes, I got a look a good look at my quarry: A plump Spinarak who was happily shoveling globs of honey into its mouth. The contented green spider made small trilling noises as it ate, its little legs carefully stepping around the sticky parts of the tree bark.\n\nIt was so cute I wanted to scream.\n\nI watched on in fascination as it continued to eat, before Surskit let out a low hiss. It didn't take long to figure out why, as a few seconds later the forest around us seemed to fill with the sound of aggressive buzzing.\n\nBeedrill.\n\nBefore I could move, a stinger rocketed through the trees and stuck itself in the tree's bark, right next to the feasting Spinarak. Startled, the Spinarak began to flee, but it was too late. Three Beedrill descended from over the treetops, closing off Spinarak's path to escape.\n\n\"Spii!\" The pokemon cried defiantly, despite its legs clearly trembling.\n\nNext to me, Surskit seemed to bristle.\n\nI looked to my pokemon and back to the scene in front of me. I felt bad for Spinarak, but I didn't like our odds against three Beedrill. I froze up entirely, trying to decide what to do.\n\nBefore I could come to a decision, however; the Beedrill acted first. One Beedril swung its drill-like arms at the Spinarak, while the poor spider barely managed to dodge.\n\nAs the Spinirak landed, a second Beedrill was already waiting. The large bee slapped Spinarak down from the tree. Spinarak hit the ground with a thud.\n\nAs the third Beedril descended to presumably 'finish off' the now motionless Spinarak, my body moved on its own. I darted forward from the bushes, cursing under my breath.\n\n\"Skiit!\" Surskit cried from behind me.\n\nI scooped the green spider up into my arms, before a searing pain sunk into my shoulder.\n\nI had been stung.\n\nCursing, I feebly attempted to bat the oversized bee away with my good arm, while it buzzed menacingly.\n\nSuddenly, a jet of water rocketed forward, causing the bee to stagger. I wasted no time getting behind Surskit.\n\n\"Surskit, we need to run.\" I panted as hot red blood dripped down my arm, staining my shirt.\n\n\"Sktt-t-t!\" Surskit hissed in defiance. My little bug was incensed, and fully intended to take on all three Beedril herself.\n\n\"No way! We're running!\" I stomped my foot.\n\nSurskit ignored me, firing off another water gun at the Beedrill that stung me. The pokemon hissed, prompting the other two to descend.\n\nOne Beedrill charged Surskit, while another shot poisonous stingers in her direction. The stingers stuck themselves about half an inch into the dirt as Surskit maneuvered around them.\n\n\"Please, Surskit!\" I pleaded. \"Its not worth it!\"\n\nJust as I said that, the third Beedrill descended upon me, wildly swinging its arms.\n\n\"Please!\" I cried out again, shielding the wounded Spinarak as I desperately attempted to flee from my pursuer.\n\nAnother water gun came zipping from Surskit's direction, hitting the third Beedrill in the back.\n\nIn an instant, Surskit zipped to my side. Her beady black eyes darted around wildly as she anticipated the attacks that threatened to come from all sides. Suddenly, her gaze snapped to me, and she gave me a nod.\n\nBefore I could interpret it, Surskit unleashed a torrent of bubbles larger than I had seen from her previously. She was distracting the Beedril so we could run.\n\nWithout hesitation, I pushed myself to run harder than ever before. Thankfully, the adrenaline had long since kicked in. Surskit sprinted at my side, firing water guns and bubblebeams at our pursuers.\n\nA few times I staggered from the searing pain in my shoulder, but I pressed on until the sounds of buzzing had long since faded, leaving only the sound of blood pumping in my ears.\n\nOnce we made it past the treeline, my vision began to blur. A pulsing, burning sensation had spread from my shoulder, and I was now growing dizzy. I didn't dare stop walking though, because I feared if I did I would collapse on the spot.\n\nOnce we made it back to the trail, I spotted a group of people— they were the last thing I saw before everything went dark.",

            "content": "My consciousness had faded in and out a few times, but I was vaguely aware of being carried. I wasn't sure how much time had passed, but eventually, I awoke to the familiar sounds of machinery beeping. I could feel a wire attached to my arm, and a dull discomfort in the top of my hand.\n\n\"Vitals are good. No, she hasn't woken up yet.\" A voice spoke.\n\n\"I don't understand why you wont let me just wait here.\"\n\n\"I understand how you feel, but like I said; even you have to follow protocol.\"\n\nSlowly, I opened my eyes to see Rita and a Nurse Joy arguing.\n\n\"Uhm... Hello?\" I croaked out. My words came out throaty and hoarse.\n\nBoth Rita and Nurse Joy snapped their focus to me.\n\n\"Oh, looks like you're awake.\" The nurse spoke. \"How are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Terrible. Everything hurts.\" I shivered.\n\n\"Ah, yes. You took quite a bit of Beedrill poison, you know?\" The nurse squinted at me. \"What exactly were you doing out there?\"\n\n\"Thats what I'd like to know.\" Rita scowled.\n\n\"Catching a.. The pokemon!\" I shot upright. \"Where is Surskit? And Spinarak!\"\n\n\"Easy, settle down.\" The nurse pushed me back into a laying-down position. \"You shouldn't be moving so quickly.\"\n\n\"Please.. I, The Spinarak was hurt and—\"\n\n\"Shhh. It's okay now. Relax.\" The nurse place a gentle hand on my shoulder. \"The Spinarak is fine, he sustained only minor injuries. Your Surskit was exhausted, but otherwise okay. We are holding her pokeball for you.\"\n\nI sighed in relief. \"That's good. Can I see them?\"\n\n\"Can you worry about yourself for a second?\" Rita cut in.\n\nI stared at Rita wordlessly for a few seconds. She stood with her arms crossed, holding my gaze.\n\n\"I.. uhm, okay.\" I stammered, breaking our staring contest.\n\n\"How much do you remember of getting here?\" Nurse Joy asked.\n\n\"Not much.. I was running from the Beedrill, and Surskit was holding them off. I made it out of the forest and... that's it, really.\"\n\n\"A group of trainers saw you collapse on the path back to the city.\" Nurse Joy started. \"They brought you and your pokemon here. Thankfully Pokemon Centers like ours are equipped with anditodes— you had a pretty high fever when you came in, on account of all the poison.\"\n\n\"I.. see.\" I coughed. \"Are they still here? I'll have to thank them.\"\n\n\"No, we had to send them away about an hour ago. It's past visiting hours— you've been asleep for a while.\"\n\nI sat silently, processing what Nurse Joy had said.\n\n\"I'll leave you two for a bit. Make sure to get plenty of rest, okay?\" The kind nurse turned and exited the room, shutting the door behind her.\n\nJust as the door closed, Rita was in my face.\n\n\"What the hell were you thinking!\" She yelled, gripping me by the collar of my hospital gown. \"You could have gotten yourself killed!\"\n\n\"I-I'm sorry!\" I stammered.\n\nRita took a deep breath, and released my gown from her grip.\n\n\"No. I'm sorry. I just— When they brought you in, you looked real bad, y'know.\" Rita took a few steps back, facing away from me.\n\n“Rita, I’m so sorry! I needed a new pokemon for the tournament so—“ I clapped a hand over my mouth.\n\nRita turned, narrowing her eyes. \"What tournament?\"\n\n“I… I shouldn’t tell anyone. Even you.”\n\nRita crossed her arms, glaring daggers at me. \"I swear—If you don’t tell me what I almost lost you for, Peppa Carmine, I’m going to finish the job.\"\n\n“I… Okay,” I took a breath. “But you can’t tell anyone.”\n\n\"I spoke to my family a few days ago, and my father told me that there would be a tournament held in about two weeks. I don't know how he knows, but he expects me to win.\"\n\nFor a moment, Rita's gaze softened, but only slightly.\n\nThe tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.\n\n\"Okay. That explains what you were doing out there.\" She sighed. \"But what I don't understand is why you didn't ask me or someone else to come with you.\"\n\n\"What do you-\"\n\n\"What I mean is, you shouldn't be wandering around the wilderness alone, Pep!\" She snapped. \"I would have came with you!\"\n\n\"You would have? I asked.\n\n\"Yes! It would be better than seeing my friend get killed by wild Beedrill!\"\n\nA silence hung in the air for a few moments.\n\n\"...I'm your friend?\" I asked.\n\n\"Pep, what did you think? Yes you're my friend, you IDIOT!\" Rita stomped her foot. \"Nobody else tolerates me except for Tom— and he's always got a look like he'll crumble into dust if I look at him!\"\n\nI stared, wide eyed for a few seconds, before breaking out into a sob.\n\n\"I was so scared!\" I wailed. \"I thought it would be fine since we caught our pokemon there!\"\n\nRita froze up, her expression shifting into an uncomfortable grimace.\n\nAs I sobbed, she placed a stiff hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"Easy. I'm sorry for yelling.\"\n\nRita stood silently with me while I cried, seemingly unsure of what to do.\n\nEventually, I managed to calm down.\n\n\"I-I'm sorry.\" I sniffled. \"I didn't want you to see that.\"\n\n\"I wont tell anyone.\"\n\n\"Promise?\"\n\n\"I promise.\" Rita gave me a solemn nod.\n\nBy the next morning, my fever had broken and I was given the all clear to be discharged from the center. Thankfully, Rita brought me a change of clothes since the clothes I wore coming in were pretty much ruined.\n\nThe first thing I did upon receiving the rest of my belongings was release Surskit from her pokeball.\n\n\"Surs! Sursssskiiititit!\" My pokemon cried as her gaze swept over me wildly, presumably checking for injuries. When her eyes fell upon my bandaged shoulder, she froze.\n\n\"Easy, easy. I'm okay.\" I assured her. \"I'm so sorry to worry you, Surskit.\"\n\n\"Skiiit.\" Surskit let out a morose whine, before snuggling up in the crook of my arm.\n\n\"It's not your fault, Surskit. Its mine. I should have known better— I shouldn't have put you in danger.\n\nRita cleared her throat from the doorway.\n\n\"I shouldn't have put us in danger.\" I corrected myself.\n\nSurskit clung to my arm, seemingly unwilling to let go. I found myself choking back tears upon seeing my pokemon so torn up.\n\n\"It's okay, Surskit. I'm alright.\" I assured her, my own voice beginning to waver.\n\nAfter a bit of comforting, Surskit finally relaxed.\n\n\"Do you want to go see Spinarak?\" I asked, wiping my eyes.\n\nSurskit looked up at me, blinking away tears. \"Surrs?\"\n\nAs Rita and I entered the clinic, a familiar nurse was already waiting for us.\n\n\"Oh, good to see you back on your feet.\" She smiled at me. \"You're here to see Spinarak, I presume?\"\n\n\"Yes, and thank you. For taking care of me.\" I responded.\n\n\"Oh, no worries— But I do have to say, please be more careful next time. You would have been in real danger if those trainers hadn't spotted you.\"\n\nRita grunted her agreement.\n\n\"Yes ma'am— I understand.\" I nodded respectfully.\n\nNurse joy turned, taking a few steps down the corridor. \"Spinarak is just this way, follow me.\"\n\nRita and I followed closely behind Nurse Joy as we walked down the winding hallways. The back of PokeCenters were a lot bigger than I had ever expected.\n\nAfter walking for what felt like forever with my injury, we came upon a door. Nurse Joy stopped, before turning to us.\n\n\"Now, before we go inside, I'll warn you both to be cautious. Spinarak is still a wild pokemon, so don't make any sudden movements or loud noises, okay?\"\n\nRita and I both nodded, and Nurse Joy opened the door.\n\nInside, the plump Spinarak was happily munching on a bowl of Poke-chow. He didn't even look up as we entered the room.\n\nI approached the spider slowly, crouching down to get closer to eye level. \"Hello, Spinarak.\" I whispered.\n\nThe pokemon looked up at me for a moment, seemingly confused. I held out my hand, and Spinirak came a bit closer.\n\nRecognition flashed across Spinarak's eyes as he took in my scent.\n\n\"Spiii!\" The pokemon cried, before climbing halfway up my leg. Startled, I fell backwards onto my butt.\n\nRita and Nurse Joy both took a few steps forward, but stopped as I started laughing.\n\n\"H-hey!\" I giggled as Spinarak skittered up my body. \"Your legs tickle!\"\n\nSpinarak stopped at my shoulder, sniffing at my bandages. He looked up at me with a troubled tilt of the head.\n\n\"Its okay, little guy. Don't worry— I'm just glad you're safe.\" I smiled at the excited spider. \"There's someone I want you to meet, okay?\"\n\nSpinarak sat in my lap as I reached for my Surskit's pokeball. I let him sniff that too, before releasing Surskit.\n\n\"Spii, spiii?\" Spinarak chirped as Surskit materialized in a flash of red light.\n\nFor a moment, the pokemon eyed eachother cautiously, before giving eachother a couple of sniffs.\n\nSpinarak ran a couple of circles around Surskit, before giving her a gentle nudge.\n\nSurskit seemed taken aback by this, but surprisingly allowed the spider to cuddle up to her. Surskit froze and looked at me with an expression that read, \"What do I do now?\"\n\nI smiled as I sat criss-cross on the floor watching the adorable display. Even Rita couldn't help but let out and \"Aww,\" upon seeing the affectionate spider nuzzle Surskit.\n\n\"So, Spinarak— I have a question for you.\" I spoke, clearing my throat.\n\nSpinarak turned and plodded over to me, once again climbing into my lap.\n\n\"You see— I'm a pokemon trainer. Surskit is my partner,\" I started. \"We train together to get stronger, and we battle together, too.\"\n\nSurskit puffed herself up triumphantly with a trill.\n\n\"I was wondering, would you like to join my team?\" I asked. \"Its okay if you don't want to, or need some time to think about it.\"\n\nSpinarak again tilted his head at me, seemingly confused.\n\nSuddenly, Surskit began to chirp.\n\n\"Surss, skit-tit-surs,\" She warbled.\n\n\"Spii? Spi-narr,\"\n\nThe two pokemon continued to converse for a couple of minutes, before Spinarak turned to me; his eyes glimmering with excitement.\n\n\"Spii spii!\" Spinarak trilled, again climbing up my chest.\n\n\"O-okay! I think thats a yes!\" I beamed at Rita.\n\n\"Looks like it to me.\" She gave me a small, barely-there smile in typical Rita fashion.\n\nI reached for my bag, and produced a pokeball. Unshrinking it from clip size, I held it out to Spinarak.\n\n\"If you join my team, that means I'll have to catch you with this. Is that okay?\" I asked the green spider.\n\n\"Narakk! Spii!\"\n\nWith a nod, I pressed the pokeball gently to Spinarak's head, and the spider disappeared in a flash of red. The ball shook twice in my hand, before giving a satisfying 'click'.\n\nIt took all of my effort to stop myself from jumping up with excitement.\n\n\"YES!!\" I raised my good arm high, holding Spinarak's pokeball up in the air.\n\nSurskit happily trilled, running circled around me.\n\n\"Shhh,\" Nurse Joy shushed me. \"This is still a hospital.\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry. Yesssssss,\" I whispered.\n\nRita playfully rolled her eyes.\n\n\"So, I guess we wont be having to relocate him,\" Nurse Joy started. \"Onto the matter of your bill.\"\n\nI froze. \"Wait, what?\"",

            "content": "After a rather awkward phone call with my mother, the matter of my bill was squared away.\n\nStill, I left the Pokecenter with my head held high, despite the slight limp. I had successfully captured a new team member. I couldn't wait to get back to training and see exactly what Spinarak could do. Rita had forbade me from training today, however; I was to take the day off of school and focus on recovery. The school had foruntately already been notified of my cirmcumstances.\n\nHonestly, I felt fine enough to return to classes, but I wasn't going to pass up a free day of relaxing at home.\n\nUntil I realized how utterly bored I was. But I didn't have to be, didn't I? I had pokemon!\n\nOnce I had settled onto my squeaky mattress, I released Surskit and Spinarak from their pokeballs.\n\n\"Surss!\"\n\n\"Spinaa!\"\n\nMy pokemon chirped in unison.\n\n\"Hey guys!\"\n\nSpinarak wasted no time crawling up and settling his plump little body into my lap.\n\n\"You're a cuddly one, huh?\" I chuckled.\n\nSurskit looked at me expectantly, as if to say, \"Uh, that's my spot?\"\n\n\"Haha, sorry Surskit.\" I gave her an apologetic smile.\n\n\"Skkttt.\" She grumbled out an annoyed hiss.\n\n\"Oh— You know what! I didn't scan you with my pokedex yet, Spinarak.\" I reached over to my nightstand, grabbing the device. Aiming it at Spinarak, I gave the button a click.\n\n\"Spinarak — The String Spit Pokemon.\n\nSpinarak hunts by weaving a sticky, but incredibly sturdy trap of web— where it waits for its prey motionlessly. This web has been likened to a 'second nervous system'— as Spinarak are able to infer a great deal about their trapped quarry based upon the web's vibrations. Some fisherman have studied Spinarak's webs in an attempt to create new fishing technology.\"\n\n\"Quite a fierce hunter you are then.\" I gave Spinarak a pat on the head.\n\nClicking the side button, I pulled up the more specific information I was after.\n\n\"Spinarak — Juvenile Male. Ability: Insomnia.\"\n\n\"Insomnia, huh?\" I cocked my head at the spider.\n\n\"Spii?\"\n\n\"If I remember correctly, that means you cant be put to sleep by other pokemon. That'll definitely come in handy.\"\n\nJust as I spoke, Surskit rushed up and gave Spinarak a poke before darting off to a corner of the room.\n\n\"Ski-skiit!\" She warbled challengly.\n\nWith a trill, the chunky spider skittered away and gave chase.\n\nI watched with a smile as my pokemon zipped around the room, playing their game of tag.\n\nThat was until moves got involved. Just as Spinirak got close to catching Surskit, Surskit used quick attack and slammed face-first into my nightstand, knocking off all of the small dresser's contents.\n\nA picture frame I had containing a photo of my grandfather and myself had shattered. Both pokemon flinched from the sound of breaking glass.\n\n\"Surskit, are you okay?\" I asked, stepping carefully around the glass shards littered across the floor.\n\nSurskit looked up at me with apologetic eyes. \"Suuurss..\"\n\nCrouching down, I picked up the broken frame and set it back on the nightstand. The picture itself was undamaged, to my relief. I let my gaze linger on the photo for a few moments, before turning to my pokemon.\n\n\"It's okay, Surskit. I know it was an accident.\" I reached out, giving her a reassuring pat on the head.\n\nThe tale has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\n\n\"Why don't I get this cleaned up, and we can get some fresh air?\"\n\nThe school's courtyard was huge— almost the size of a small park. I picked a bench off to the side, and released my pokemon.\n\nMy bandages felt hot under the afternoon sun, but I was pleased to see my pokemon getting along so well together. Spinarak and Surskit had resumed their game of tag, with far less breaking things involved.\n\nAfter a while of watching my pokemon play, I was approached by Ms. Kimber. I felt my body straighten as she approached.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be resting?\" Her gaze settled onto me.\n\n\"Ah—Uhm, well yes.\" I stammered. \"Its just.. I wanted to give my pokemon some time to play. They have to spend so much time in their pokeballs while I'm in classes, so I figured since I had the day off, some fresh air would be good for them.\"\n\nMs. Kimber nodded thoughtfully for a moment, before taking a seat on the bench beside me.\n\n\"I hope you don't mind.\" She said as she sat down.\n\n\"Not at all.\" I replied stiffly.\n\n\"I actually was looking for you,\" Ms. Kimber started. \" you see— I'm an old friend of your father's. We went to school together way back when.\"\n\n\"Oh.. Is that so?\"\n\n\"I thought I had recognized you on the plane— you're the spitting image of him, you know that?\"\n\nI fought the urge to groan. \"Yes, I've heard that before.\"\n\n\"Anyways, that isn't what I wanted to talk about.\" Ms. Kimber sighed. \"You seem to be at the center of trouble often. I acknowledge that the Gabite being within the bounds of the exam area wasn't your fault, but.. What you pulled with the Beedrill, it can't happen again.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\" I nodded.\n\n\"I just want you to understand—You could have gotten you and your pokemon killed.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I responded solemnly, staring at my feet.\n\n\"Don't worry. Your father got himself into plenty of trouble as a young trainer too, y'know.\"\n\n\"Did he?\"\n\n\"He's never told you?\" Ms. Kimber seemed genuinely surprised.\n\n\"No. We.. don't really talk much.\"\n\n\"I.. see. Well if you ever need anything; to ask for advice or if you have any questions— you can always come to me. I'd hate to see you get hurt again out there.\"\n\n\"Thankyou, Ms. Kimber.\"\n\n\"Please; just Vivienne or Kimber when we aren't in class. Truthfully, I hate how stuffy the \"Miss.\" sounds.\"\n\nOur conversation once again fell into a lull for a few moments, while Kimber's eyes watched my pokemon play their game of tag.\n\n\"I am curious though, what are your goals after you graduate?\" She asked, breaking the silence.\n\n\"Aside from taking on the Pokemon League Challenge, I hadn't really given it much thought.\" I replied.\n\n\"I see. Have you given any thought to the type of team you want to build?\"\n\n\"A little, but.. I don't know, really. I was so happy just to catch Surskit, and now Spinarak.. I've just sort of been taking things as they come.\"\n\n\"Mm. So catching two bug types wasn't intentional?\"\n\n\"No— but I'm happy that I did. I think bug types are awesome.\" I huffed. \"It bothers me that no one else seems to think so.\"\n\n\"Sorry— that isn't what I meant. I had just assumed you were going for a mono-type team is all.\"\n\n\"Mono-type?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, as in, one type only. Many trainers choose to build well rounded teams of multiple types, but a rare few stick to their favorite. Like me, for example.\"\n\nI quirked an eyebrow. \"What type do you train?\"\n\n\"Ground types. They've been my favorite since I was a girl.\" Kimber smiled warmly. \"Say, would you like to meet my partner pokemon?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\nKimber rose, her shoulder-length brown hair fluttering in the breeze. Unclipping a black and gold pokeball from her belt, she released her pokemon with an effortless grace that left me starstruck.\n\n\"Go, Flygon!\"\n\nMaterializing from red light, the Flygon stretched its wings— cutting an imposing figure. The green dragon looked to be about six or seven feet tall. Red, goggled eyes sparkled with intelligence, as the impressive creature nuzzled its trainer affectionately.\n\nSurskit and Spinarak ceased their playing, eyeing up the massive pokemon that now stood before me with looks of bewilderment and wonder.\n\n\"This is Flygon,\" Kimber started. \"I caught him as a Trapinch when I was around your age. I actually grew up in Lavaridge town, you know. Not too far from Hoenn's desert.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you were from Hoenn,\" I breathed out, taking in the sight of the massive pokemon.\n\n\"Yes, I was actually on the way back from visiting my old gym when you saw me on the plane.\"\n\n\"You used to be a gym leader?!\" I shot up.\n\nKimber gave a slightly smug smile. \"You bet I was. That was a long time ago, though.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll forgive me for how this comes across, but you really don't seem that old.\"\n\n\"Well I'll take that as a compliment!\" Kimber laughed.\n\n\"Do you ever miss being a gym leader?\" I asked.\n\nKimber gave me a thoughtful look before replying.\n\n\"Sometimes, but I think that teaching is my real calling. I already went as far as I could go with the battle circuit; I'm happy to be where I'm at.\"\n\nJust as Kimber replied, Flygon seemed to notice the two bug type pokemon looking him over. Amusement shone in his eyes as he struck a battle-ready pose, seemingly showing off.\n\n\"Gohhnnn!\"\n\nSurskit bowed up in response, puffing herself up in an attempt to look larger. Spinarak scurried away and hid behind my leg.\n\nBoth Kimber and I couldn't help but chuckle.\n\n\"You'll have to forgive him, he's always been one to showboat.\" Kimber gave a lighthearted laugh. \"Anyways, I'll leave you to it. Remember that you can always come to me if you need anything.\"\n\n\"Thankyou, uhm.. Kimber.\" I awkwardly nodded my appreciation.\n\n\"Ready to go, Flygon?\" Kimber asked, again approaching her companion.\n\nFlygon leaned down, allowing Kimber to climb onto his back. The woman mounted her pokemon with a practiced poise. Kimber gave her companion a pat on the shoulder, and one beat of the creature's wings sent dust sprawling in all directions.\n\n\"Oh— And make sure to get plenty of rest!\" Kimber called over the sound of Flygon's wing beats. In a split second, the two were off. I watched with barely contained amazement as Flygon soared, seemingly shearing the clouds within seconds.\n\nI watched until Flygon was little more than a dot in the sky, before reaching a certain conclusion for myself.\n\nI wanted to be a trainer like her.",

            "content": "After my pokemon tired themselves out, I returned to the dorm room to rest. Truthfully, I was exhausted. I had wanted to go to the library and get some studying done, but my injury was taking its toll.\n\nA few hours later, the sound of the door clicking shut woke me from my nap. Rita had returned to the dorm room, looking rather solemn.\n\nBefore I could ask what was wrong, she flopped onto her mattress with a heavy sigh.\n\n\"Pep, we need to talk.\" her voice came, muffled by her fluffy pink covers.\n\n\"Okay,\" I yawned. \"Is everything alright?\"\n\n\"They announced the tournament today,\" Rita started, flipping over onto her back. \"All of us have to participate.\"\n\n\"Oh.. How did it go over?\" I asked, sitting upright.\n\n\"About as well as you'd expect. Tom looked like he was going to puke.\"\n\n\"Poor guy.\" I grimaced.\n\n\"I know.\" Rita sat upright, clutching a pillow.\n\n\"What I wanted to say was that I think we should train separately for a while.\" The girl spoke without meeting my gaze.\n\n\"What? Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because, Pep. We might have to go up against each other in the tournament.. If that happens, well. I'm not going to pull any punches, y'know?\"\n\n\"Ah. That's okay.\" I smiled. \"I wouldn't expect anything less.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Pep. I know you really want to win too, but there's too much riding on this. If I do well, I could get sponsored.\" Rita looked at me, her usual emotionless visage morphed into one of concern. \"I...I don't want to work in the Pokecenter for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"Rita, really; it's okay.\" I gave her a toothy grin and a thumbs up. \"If it comes down to it, I wish us both the best of luck. I won't be pulling any punches, either.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Rita gave a weak smile, before stalking off to the bathroom.\n\nDespite what I had said, I really hoped I wouldn't have to face off against my friend.\n\nThe following day, I attended classes as usual. I suffered a few stares and sidelong glances upon my return, but nobody really said anything about my bandaged arm. I ate lunch with Rita and Tom, and after classes let out, made my way to the training field.\n\nThe field was packed to the brim with students and their pokemon training. I spotted a few familiar faces— Liam and his Chimchar, along with Claire and her Buizel. When I arrived at our usual spot, Tom and Rita were both nowhere to be found.\n\nI sighed inwardly, before releasing my two pokemon.\n\nSurskit stretched her legs in preparation for today's training, while Spinarak watched her confusedly.\n\n\"Spinarak, can you come over here please?\" I beckoned the tubby spider over.\n\n\"Spii!\" My obedient spider waddled over with a trill.\n\n\"So today I need to see your moves, do you think you could show me what you know?\" I knelt down to look Spinarak in the eyes.\n\nThis book was originally published on Royal Road. Check it out there for the real experience.\n\n\"Spii-spiin!\"\n\n“Spinarak went through a rotation of a few moves. Poison Sting, String Shot, and Absorb flew out, but then a fourth came too:\n\nBright green bug-type energy gathered around Spinarak, taking the form of faux-insects. With a mental command, the 'insects' flew off, infesting and harassing a single spot on the ground.\n\nI clapped my hands. \"Infestation!\" Truly a useful move at early levels. Once it hits a target, the effect of the 'infestation' would linger for a while, doing damage over time. Even though I was sure Spinarak was more of a physical attacker than special attacker, the extra damage tics would come in handy for sure.\n\nThe last move Spinarak showed off was Scary Face— Spinarak had puffed himself up, revealing the face-like markings on his back. If I remembered correctly, this was a move that could lower the opponent's speed.\n\nOnce he was finished, I gave Spinarak a gentle pat on the head. \"Well done.\"\n\nRising, I again addressed both of my pokemon.\n\n\"Okay, so the plan for today is to maximize both of your strengths.\" I started. \"Surskit, I want you to keep using quick attack, and see if you can increase your speed. Your agility is a huge asset, so I want to capitalize on that as much as possible.\"\n\n\"Spinarak, I want you working on learning Bug Bite. It might be difficult, but Surskit managed it, so I think you can too. We're going to work on gathering bug type energy at your mouth, before releasing it with a bite. Surskit, can you demonstrate?\"\n\nI produced the now raggedy poke-doll from my bag, placing it in front of Surskit.\n\nWith a nod, Surskit gathered up bug-type energy, before releasing it with a snap on the abused doll.\n\nI thanked Surskit, and turned to address my spider once again.\n\n\"Think you can do that?\"\n\n\"Spiin!\" A determined look flashed across Spinarak's eyes.\n\nAll at once, bug-type energy gathered around Spinarak's mouth, effortlessly. With a snap, Spinarak perfectly recreated the move, with even more force than Surskit had put behind it.\n\nI stood, dumbfounded. Surskit looked incensed.\n\n\"You're a quick learner,\" I started, noticing a chunk had been taken from the Pokedoll. \"I guess we can scratch that one off the list.\"\n\nSurskit huffed, turning away from Spinarak and I.\n\n\"Come on, don't be like that Surskit. Spinarak was already used to handling bug-type energy.\" I knelt down, attempting to comfort my bug.\n\n\"Skttt.\" She hissed in annoyance, before using a quick attack to speed away.\n\nI watched after her as she zipped back and forth, giving her all to her training. I supposed that she wanted to make sure she couldn't be beaten at her speed, at the very least.\n\nAfter Spinarak's success with bug bite, I had him work on his aim with string shot and poison sting. I made a mental note to return to the library as soon as possible to research the moves Spinarak could potentially learn.\n\n\"I feel like I'm going to make a huge joke of myself.\" Tom groaned, taking a bite of his sandwich.\n\n\"Come on, Tom. You and Lotad have improved so much!\" I projected my voice slightly over the din of the cafeteria.\n\n\"Well, with only one pokemon..\" Rita trailed off.\n\n\"Not. Helping.\" I elbowed Rita gently, before taking another bite of my lunch.\n\n\"I want to catch another pokemon, but I'm not sure where to go— I don't want to go somewhere dangerous and end up like you, Pep.\" Tom gulped down another bite. \"Speaking of, how's your shoulder doing?\"\n\n\"A lot better than it was before. It's still pretty sore, but overall not too bad. That Nurse Joy really did a great job patching me up.\" I smiled.\n\n\"You're from the Joy family, right Rita?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"Yeah, why?\" Rita asked, giving him a look like she didn't want to talk about it.\n\n\"Were you related to the Nurse Joy that patched me up?\" I interjected.\n\n\"Yeah; she's my cousin. I'm related to most of the Nurse Joys here in Jubilife.\"\n\n\"You don't want to be a Nurse Joy, then?\" Tom asked innocently.\n\n\"No, not really.\" Rita spat. \"And I'm a little tired of everyone asking.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" Tom spoke. \"I don't mean to pry, I was just curious.\"\n\n\"It's okay.\"\n\nRita took another bite of her food, leaving us both in an uncomfortable silence, save for the plethora of conversations happening all around us.\n\n\"Anyways, I could come with you to catch another pokemon.\" I spoke, quickly changing the subject.\n\nTom and Rita both looked at me like I was crazy.\n\n\"Pep, I really don't think thats a good idea—\" Tom started.\n\n\"No. Are you out of your mind?\" Rita cut him off. \"You're still in no condition to be going out into the wild. I'll go with him.\"\n\n\"B-but— What?\" Tom sputtered. \"No, no. I couldn't possibly trouble you, Rita. I'll figure something out.\"\n\n\"I'm offering.\" Rita spoke plainly, her expressionless gaze boring into Tom.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Tom looked like he might fade away into a fine mist.\n\n\"Yeah, it's no trouble. I may even look for a third party member while I'm at it.\"\n\n\"I want to go...\" I deflated a bit.\n\n\"Next time.\" Rita assured me with a soft smile. \"Provided you don't find some way to get yourself injured again.\"\n\n\"Oh no. I'm good at that.\" I grinned.\n\n\"I know.\" Rita said flatly.",

            "content": "Rita was bored— Unimaginably so. When she had offered to come with Tom to hunt for pokemon, she had pictured something a little more exciting than well, this.\n\nTom had taken her to Route 218— a route just west of the city. The two sat on the precipice of a marina, salty ocean air lapping at their skin.\n\nThe boy sat at the water's edge with a well-kept Poke-Rod and tacklebox, waiting for a bite. He had sat silently, motionlessly— for what felt like hours. In reality, it hadn't been that long, but that didn't change the fact that every second seemed to drag on. Those were seconds she could devote to something useful, like training or studying.\n\nStill, when the boy handed her a poke-rod and some bait, she hadn't had the heart to refuse. She would try things his way— Tom was a nice enough guy, after all. Where most of her other peers would stare or whisper behind her back, Tom seemed genuinely uninterested in that sort of behavior. He was timid, sure— but the two had gotten a bit closer through their shared friend in Pep. Rita had to respect Tom standing up to his friend with the Chimchar, too.\n\nThe surface of the water rippled momentarily, and for a moment Rita prayed that something—anything, would happen to break her free from this watery purgatory.\n\nBut it was not to be.\n\nTom still eyed the water unflinchingly, but allowed his posture to relax. Beside him, the boy's sleepy-eyed Lotad watched the ripples on the water's surface, mimicking his trainer's unmovable gaze. There really couldn't have been a better partner for him, Rita thought to herself.\n\n\"Isn't this relaxing?\" Tom spoke, snapping Rita from her thoughts. \"I love the smell of the ocean.\"\n\n\"Um.. Sure.\" Rita lied. For her, it was anything but. Every second that ticked on made her want to jump out of her skin. She couldn't remember the last time she had sat still for this long, asides from her classes.\n\n\"So, where did you learn to fish?\" Rita asked, desperate for something worth talking about.\n\n\"Oh, well, I'm actually from Canalave City, you know. I grew up on boats with my dad and brothers.\" Tom answered. \"We did a lot of fishing when I was a kid. Mostly just catching and releasing Magikarp, though.\"\n\nRita raised an eyebrow. \"Any run-ins with Gyarados?\"\n\n\"Well, here and there but the Gyarados around those parts are used to fishermen,\" Tom brushed his sandy-blonde hair from his eyes. \"We usually would throw them some food and they'd be on their way.\"\n\nJust as Rita opened her mouth to speak, something began to tug at her line. She turned to Tom, panicked.\n\n\"What do I do?!\"\n\n\"Easy, easy.\" Tom reached around, grabbing the Poke Rod with a firm grip. \"Hold it steady, don't freak out. Just reel her in slow.\"\n\nRita took a breath, and began reeling in the line.\n\nLittle by little, a blue shape crowned through the water's surface.\n\n\"Pull!\" Tom commanded.\n\nWith a yank, the pokemon at the other end of the line was revealed— a rather perturbed looking Tentacool.\n\n\"Tehnnn! Tenta!\" The pokemon hissed, clearly unhappy that its lunch had been interrupted.\n\nRita instinctively reached for Grimer's pokeball, but Tom stopped her.\n\n\"Try this instead.\" The boy grinned, producing a handful of brightly colored berries from his coat pocket.\n\n\"What?\" Rita gasped.\n\n\"Try feeding her, Rita. She's probably just hungry.\"\n\nWith a gulp, Rita took a berry and held it out to the pokemon— Shutting her eyes as she did.\n\nShe expected the pokemon to bite, to lash out— to do something, but nothing came. Instead, the Tentacool eyed her suspiciously, not making any moves.\n\nRight. This was just a pokemon, after all. Rita worked with pokemon regularly while volunteering at the Pokecenter. What am I letting myself get so worked up over? She thought.\n\nTaking a breath, Rita knelt down to reach eye level with the Tentacool, offering it the berry once more.\n\n\"It's okay, I'm sorry if I scared you.\" She spoke in a hushed tone.\n\nTom looked on, nodding approvingly.\n\nGingerly, the pokemon took the offered berry in its tentacle, before raising it to its mouth. It munched away for a few seconds, before giving a contented \"Co-coool.\"\n\nThe tale has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\n\nRelaxing, Rita sat cross-legged from the pokemon, and offered it another berry. The pokemon again took her offering, this time eating with less hesitation.\n\nAs Tentacool ate, Rita slowly reached for her pokedex, before aiming it at the creature.\n\n\"Tentacool — The Jellyfish Pokemon. A Water/Poison Type.\n\nTentacool generally spend their lives drifting along the waves of shallow seas, using its toxic feelers to stab unsuspecting prey. As such, Tentacool can often be considered a hazard to anglers and swimmers. A Tentacool's body is comprised almost entirely of water, and as such is prone to drying out. Trainers of Tentacool must take special care to keep their pokemon hydrated.\"\n\n\"Ten-ta?\" The pokemon warbled, eyeing the pokedex cautiously.\n\n\"Sorry, I just wanted to learn more about you.\" Rita smiled, pocketing the device. \"You're a really fascinating pokemon, Tentacool.\"\n\nThe jellyfish did a little twirl, sending saltwater spraying gently in all directions.\n\n\"Tenta-ten.\"\n\n\"I'd love to ask you to come with me, but,\" Rita frowned. \"I'm not sure there's enough water where I live.\"\n\nThe Tentacool looked up at Rita, confusedly.\n\n\"The school actually has a small aquarium for water types,\" Tom started. \"It wouldn't be impossible. Plenty of water-type trainers find ways to get around it.\"\n\n\"I suppose.\" Rita sat silently, thinking for a moment. \"Would you like to come with me, Tentacool? I'm a pokemon trainer. We could train together, and get stronger. If you don't want to it's okay— I wouldn't take you away if you're happy here.\"\n\nA determined look flashed across the pokemons eyes, before it gestured to Grimer's pokeball. \"Tent-tenta!\"\n\n\"I think it wants to battle you first,\" Tom spoke.\n\nRita's heart skipped in her chest momentarily. \"And if I win I can capture you? You're sure?\"\n\n\"Co-cool! Tenta!\"\n\nThe Tentacool bobbed in the water, its eyes not leaving Rita for a second.\n\n\"Ready?\" Rita asked, a bead of sweat dripping from her temple.\n\nThe pokemon gave a brusque nod.\n\nRita thought for a moment, considering whether now would be a good time to test her Oddish out in battle— but decided against it. Given Tentacool's poison typing, there wasn't a whole lot the little shrub could do to damage it. Grimer just had a bit more coverage in the way of moves, as he had been training alongside Rita for far longer.\n\n\"Go, Grimer!\"\n\nThe oozey creature materialized, floating atop the water's surface. Grimer rocked gently with the waves, eyeing down his opponent.\n\nThe Tentacool made the first move, diving under. Grimer was at a clear disadvantage in this situation, but both pokemon and trainer kept their cool with a steely determination.\n\nTentacles shot out, wrapping Grimer in their toxic grasp— though Grimer was mostly unaffected.\n\n\"Minimize, Grimer!\" Rita called.\n\nGrimer shrunk down, easily slipping from Tentacool's grasp.\n\nTentacool gave chase, cresting over the waves as Grimer floated away.\n\n\"Now! Mud slap!\"\n\nGround-type energy materialized around Grimer momentarily, before coalescing into a ball of mud. Just as Tentacool got close enough to threaten Grimer with another grab, Grimer released the energy, slapping tentacool directly in the face for super-effective damage.\n\nTentacool flew backwards, before retreating beneath the waves again.\n\n\"Okay Grimer, when Tentacool comes back up, use pound.\"\n\n\"Griii.\" Grimer nodded in acknowledgement.\n\nAfter a few moments, a disturbance in the water's surface alerted Grimer. Grimer moved to attack, but instead was hit with a circular projectile of water.\n\n\"Water pulse!\" Rita gasped as her pokemon reeled back, staggering.\n\nGrimer's movements became erratic, he looked all around as if searching for something.\n\nConfusion.\n\n\"Grimer! Listen to my voice, you need to relax!\" Rita called out desperately to her pokemon.\n\nGrimer moved towards the sound of Rita's voice, before being hit with another water pulse— being sent staggering back once more.\n\nAs Grimer rocked back and forth with the waves, he tried desperately to hit and punch at the air— hoping to hit an opponent that wasn't there.\n\n\"Snap out of it Grimer!\" Rita cried.\n\nBut it was to no avail. Tentacles once again wrapped around Grimer, squeezing his oozey body tightly.\n\nAs Tentacool's grip tightened— something snapped in Grimer's head, and awareness came flooding back to him. He once again used minimize to slip away.\n\n\"Grimer! Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Griiiihhhmme.\" The pokemon bellowed, enraged that it had been confused by its opponent.\n\n\"Alright. Lets do this.\"\n\nGrimer skidded across the water towards Tentacool once more, threatening to pound the jellyfish in the face.\n\nTentacool reeled back, preparing to fire off another water pulse. Water-type energy gathered in a ring, before firing straight towards the encroaching Grimer.\n\n\"Grimer dodge, then disable!\"\n\nGrimer briefly plopped under the waves, dodging out of the way of Tentacool's attack. Surfacing again, a glittering white light shone in the ooze's eyes as well as the rivaling pokemon, marking the successful use of disable. Tentacool would no longer be able to fire off Water Pulses.\n\n\"Yes, great job!\" Rita praised her blob.\n\n\"Griiihme!\" The pokemon belched, sending forth a noxious cloud of fumes.\n\nHaving had enough of this, Tentacool surged forward, lashing out with its tentacles.\n\n\"Grimer, mud slap, again!\"\n\nGrimer didn't move as the Tentacool charged towards him. Instead, he leaned back— waiting. As the Tentacool came within striking distance, he once again fired off a mud-slap, sending a wet snapping sound reverberating off the water. A clean hit.\n\nAs Tentacool reeled backwards, Grimer pursued it with a pound. After a series of hits, the battle was over.\n\nTentacool floated weakly, having been beaten.\n\n\"Great job Grimer!\" Rita called out to her pokemon, before returning him to his pokeball. \"Get some good rest, now.\"\n\nCrouching down along the waters edge, Rita once again spoke to the jellyfish, who now was looking worse for wear.\n\n\"Are you still sure you want to come with me? I know what we agreed on, but I want to make sure you're really okay with this.\"\n\n\"Tehntaa.\" the pokemon once again gave her a nod.\n\n\"Thank you. I promise I'll take great care of you.\"\n\nWith that, Rita threw a pokeball— a pink and white heal ball that matched all of her others.\n\nThe pokeball rocked a few times with the waves, before sealing shut with a 'click'. The capture had been successful.\n\n\"Congratulations!\" Tom clapped.\n\nA small smile crept across Rita's face, as she pulled the wet pokeball from the water.\n\n\"Thanks Tom. I'm starting to think that fishing maybe doesn't suck.\"\n\nJust as Rita turned to look at Tom, she noticed that there was another pokemon sat next to his Lotad— A rather content looking Glameow, with berry juice plastered across its face.\n\n\"Uhm... Tom?\" She asked.\n\n\"Oh, uh. I think she came for the snacks.\" Tom said, giving the Glameow a scratch under the chin.",

            "content": "I seethed with jealousy as Rita regaled me with all the details of her encounter with Tentacool and the subsequent battle. I was happy for her, sure— but after hearing about how Tom managed to get a pokemon to follow him home, I felt like I had missed out on a great opportunity to capture a third party member.\n\nOh well. I had my hands full training Spinarak and Surskit as it was— I wanted to get the two of them tournament ready before anything else. While my friends were away, I had taken the time to gather more information on the tournament— it seemed the matches would be one-on-one, but our pokemon would no doubt get tired after repeated matches. Students who had managed to capture and train more than one pokemon would naturally fare far better. After doing some reconnaissance around the training grounds, it seemed that a good portion of my peers were still scrambling to capture a second party member— which, thankfully, put me a bit ahead of the curve. I could only hope that it would be enough.\n\nAfter parting ways with Rita, I once again made my way for the library. She had wanted me to stay and rest longer, but I was itching for something to do— and truthfully couldn't afford to waste any more time on my injury.\n\nI entered the grandiose library, this time knowing exactly where I was going. As I made my way to the bug type section, I ran into an unfortunately familiar face. Beatrice stood, flipping through a book on local bug types. She seemed thoroughly engrossed in her book, as she hadn't yet noticed me.\n\nI cleared my throat. \"I would have figured you were too good for bugs.\"\n\nWith a start, Beatrice snapped the book shut, evidently caught off guard.\n\n\"Ah, Peppa Carmine. Pleasure to see you again.\" Beatrice responded coolly.\n\n\"Yeah, a pleasure. Just like that time you left us to die.\" I snarled.\n\n\"Please, this is a library. Keep your voice down.\" The girl spoke in a hushed tone. \"Plus, I didn't leave you to die. I went and got help, like any student would be advised to do.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" I muttered. \"Tell yourself that.\"\n\nBeatrice fell silent for a few moments, before once again turning to address me.\n\n\"If you didn't need anything, could you leave? I'm trying to get some research done.\"\n\n\"Yeah. So was I.\" I folded my arms.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, Beatrice once again resumed flipping through her book.\n\nStepping around her, I searched for the book I had used previously, and after a few moments found it. As I turned to walk away, I couldn't help but glance over Beatrice's small shoulders. It seemed she was looking at an entry about female Combee.\n\n\"Combee, huh?\" I eyed the entry in the book with interest.\n\nYou could be reading stolen content. Head to Royal Road for the genuine story.\n\nInstantly Beatrice spun around, looking up at me with a baleful stare. \"Its none of your business!\"\n\n\"Shhh,\" I put a finger over my mouth. \"This is a library.\"\n\nFor a moment, the corners of Beatrice's mouth twitched like she wanted to say something, but she instead turned and placed her book back on the shelf.\n\n\"Enjoy your studies,\" She spoke evenly, before stalking off, taking her miasma of haughtiness with her.\n\nA wave of satisfaction crept over me knowing that I had ruffled her feathers. Still, I couldn't help but wonder what sparked Beatrice's interest in a bug type— especially after she had looked down on Surskit.\n\nFrom what I could recall of Combee, they were one of the exclusive pokemon that could only be caught using honey on trees, back when the original Sinnoh games came out. This was particularly annoying because once you slathered the honey on the trees, you would have to wait six real-life hours before finding an encounter— and the odds that you would find one were abysmally low. To make matters worse, only female Combees could evolve. You could wait hours and hours, and once you finally found your quarry, realize that it couldn't evolve due to its gender. I shuddered, thanking Arceus that I was no longer at the mercy of RNG.\n\nVespiquen— the evolution of Combee — fit a sort of 'queen bee' archetype, and as such featured moves that only it could learn: Attack Order and Defend Order. While Vespiquen wasn't really a 'meta' pick due to its bug typing, it did feature some of the most decent stats when compared to others of its type.\n\nI snorted— Of course Beatrice of all people would want a queen bee pokemon. Regardless, I had no doubt Vespiquen would be a good addition to most any team— I would have to keep my eyes peeled for Combee next time I went looking for pokemon.\n\nSettling down with my book, I flit through the pages for a bit until I found an entry on Spinarak. Researching Spinarak's learnable moves would be vital, and Spinarak himself had already proven to be a quick study.\n\nThumbing through the pages, I quickly came upon a list of known learnable moves— some of which Spinarak had already demonstrated, such as Infestation, String-shot, and Poison Sting. The list itself was much longer than Surskit's.\n\nThe first few moves of interest that I came upon were X-Scissor, Shadow Sneak, Screech, and Sticky Web. X-Scissor would be a good overall damaging move to have in our arsenal, while Shadow Sneak would allow Spinarak to sneak around and get some cheap hits in. Not to mention, the move's ghost typing would be a good counter in case I had to face off against Beatrice and her Drifloon. Screech and Sticky Web in tandem would also be a nasty combo for lowering our opponent's speed, as well.\n\nAs my eyes made their way down the page, I also noted moves such as Poison Jab and Leech Life, but I decided not to bite off more than I could chew at this point— it wouldn't do to overwhelm my poor spider.\n\nMy plan was already beginning to take shape in my mind. All that was left was to train my pokemon, and hope for the best.\n\nCool wind whined in my ears as I exited the library, heralding the arrival of storm clouds that loomed over me about as much as the upcoming tournament. Relying on my mono-type bug team could very well be a mistake, but I was content to try. I knew there were better, safer bets— but there were no other pokemon I wanted to train with more than Surskit and Spinarak. Surskit had pushed herself so hard for me, and had even saved my life— and while Spinarak was a new addition, the sweet little spider had taken to training so quickly. No matter how things panned out, there was no way the two of them could ever let me down.\n\nStill, anxieties clouded my mind when I thought of the expectations being levied onto me. Maybe that's what Ms. Kimber felt before her first big tournament. There would be so much capable competition, with teams that were much more cohesive by default. Eyes that pried from all sides, searching— evaluating. If she had a chance, if she managed to do as well as she did— to go as far as to become an official Gym Leader, maybe I would have a chance as well.",

            "content": "Days and nights blurred together as I repeated the cycle of attending classes and training, without much else in between. In the blink of an eye, nearly an entire week had passed.\n\nDuring the course of the last week, Surskit had improved her speed significantly. Training her aim with water gun had paid off, and as a result, she had become quite accurate with her Bubble-beam attack as well. As for Spinarak, he mostly focused on learning new moves. He had picked up Sticky Web easily enough, as spinning webs seemed to be one of those abilities his species innately knew— much like Surskit and her Sweet Scent. Originally, I had him try to learn Shadow Sneak, but learning to handle ghost-type energy within a week seemed infeasible. Instead, we had changed gears and attempted to get him to learn X-Scissor instead. This came a bit more naturally to Spinarak, as he seemed to comprehend the general idea behind the move — but he had only managed to pull it off once during our training.\n\nEither way, I was happy with my pokemon's progress, as well as my own. After getting the all-clear from Rita, I resumed light exercise alongside my pokemon. It just didn't feel right to sit and watch them train while I did nothing, injury or not.\n\nAll of our progress, all of our effort— it all came down to now.\n\nI drew in a long breath, eyeing the locker room door. Any second now, my name could be called over the loudspeakers, and it would be my turn to go out there before a crowd of onlookers and prove that I deserved to be here. A bead of sweat dropped from my forehead— causing me to hastily wipe my brow with my sleeve. I fixed my hair a few more times, before taking another deep breath— trying in vain to force myself to relax. If I survive this, maybe I'll survive my father chewing me out for eternity, too.\n\nCasting my nervous gaze around the locker room, many of my peers seemed to be faring about the same as I. One girl seemed to be giving herself a quiet pep-talk in the mirror, while another just a few feet away seemed to be comforting her anxious Marill. The only familiar face I had seen today was Rita, but she must have gotten sent to a different locker room, because she was nowhere to be found here.\n\nAn obnoxiously exuberant chime blared from the speaker on the ceiling, causing everyone in the room to freeze. I gripped Surskit's pokeball white-knuckle tight as the tune played.\n\n\"Peppa Carmine, please make your way to training court 1-A. I repeat, Peppa Carmine, please make your way to—\"\n\nI felt the blood in my face drain as the cheerful voice spoke my name. I silently cursed as I stood, my legs wobbling underneath me.\n\nCalm down, Pep. Calm down. You can do this, I internally repeated to myself as my steps came one after the other.\n\nAs I pushed my way beyond the door, a wall of noise assaulted my ears— and with each step down the narrow hallway, grew closer and closer. I almost wanted to turn around, to pretend I wasn't here. But no— I had worked hard for this moment, and so had my pokemon.\n\nPressing on, I entered the school's exhaustively large gymnasium, where a sea of people crowded the rafters. From all sides I was bombarded by stimuli — talking, laughing; lights, cameras flashing. The tournament had turned out to be a much bigger affair than I had previously expected. All around me, trainers and their pokemon had gathered across several training courts. Pushing past my nerves, I found my way to the court labeled 1-A and stood at one end of it. Across from me, I recognized my opponent to be Liam— The boy with the Chimchar that Tom had wanted to face off against. Unfortunately, things never seemed to work out the way we want them to— It looked like I would be beating Tom to the punch on this one.\n\nLiam eyed me up and down, a smug smile playing at his lips.\n\n\"Carmine, yeah?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Its too bad you got me first. This is going to be a short tournament for you.\" Liam smirked, brandishing a pokeball at me.\n\nMy eyes flit to the left just above the battle court, where a man with a large camera stood among the crowd on the balcony-like rafters. This was being recorded— it wouldn't do to lose my cool.\n\nInstead, I ignored Liam entirely, choosing to focus only on my breathing for a few moments.\n\nA rather burly looking referee stepped onto the court between us, holding a microphone in one hand.\n\n\"In the blue corner, and hailing from Lilycove City— Peppa Carmine!\" The man spoke.\n\nSupport the creativity of authors by visiting Royal Road for this novel and more.\n\nA wave of cheers from the audience caught me off guard. I sheepishly grinned and waved back.\n\n\"In the red corner, and hailing from our very own Jubilife City— Liam White!\"\n\nThe cheers that came following Liam's name drowned out the whole stadium momentarily— Marking him as a clear favorite.\n\n\"Now I'll go over the rules for both of our participants.\" The referee cleared his throat. \"Today's battles will be one-on-one. The battle is over when either pokemon is unable to continue, or otherwise when I call it. The use of items is forbidden. Understand?\"\n\nBoth Liam and I nodded our agreement.\n\n\"Alright. I'll ask you both to select and send out your pokemon.\"\n\nWithout a moments hesitation, Liam sent out his pokemon— and in a flash of light, a Monferno appeared. It looked like Chimchar had evolved.\n\nI sucked my teeth. An evolved pokemon right off the bat wasn't ideal, but I couldn't let that intimidate me. I just had to believe that Surskit could handle this— and so I sent her out. My bug appeared on the court with a determined \"Skktt!\"\n\n\"Three..\"\n\nAs the referee began the countdown, Monferno began flexing his arms at Surskit in some sort of taunt. Surskit hissed her annoyance, but otherwise kept her cool. I was proud of her for not immediately charging him. My feisty little bug had really come so far in such a short amount of time.\n\n\"..Two,\"\n\n\"..One! Begin!\" The referee called.\n\n\"Monferno! Mach Punch!\" Liam commanded.\n\n\"Don't let him catch you!\"\n\nMonferno lunged towards Surskit with frightening speed, threatening to nail her with a heavy fist. Fortunately, Surskit moved just a hair sooner, narrowly dodging the blow. Monferno's fist connected with the ground, sending dust flying.\n\n\"Surskit, Bubble-beam!\"\n\nWe absolutely had to get some damage in on Monferno first. He didn't look to be very tanky, but his speed had startled me. If we hadn't spent so much time focusing on building up Surskit's speed, I worried that Monferno's initial blow would have seen Surskit going down before the match could start.\n\nAs Monferno turned to face Surskit, he was slammed with her Bubble-beam square in the chest. A direct hit, for super-effective damage no less.\n\nI grinned. \"Good! Stay on the move Surskit!\"\n\nSurskit gave me a brief nod, before dodging out of the way of another blow.\n\n\"Monferno, feint!\"\n\nAs Surskit dodged a blow from the left, Monferno feinted right, this time catching Surskit off guard. The blow connected, sending Surskit flying backwards with a thud.\n\nI gasped. \"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Skkkt!\" Surskit hissed, giving me a nod as she struggled to her feet.\n\n\"Yes!\" Liam cheered. \"Don't give her a chance to get up!\"\n\n\"Surskit! Water gun at Monferno's feet!\" I cried out to my bug, who barely had a chance to stand up before the much larger pokemon set upon her again.\n\nSurskit's attack sent water spraying into Monferno's face, causing him to stagger backwards for a moment. Fire types would naturally have an aversion to water, after all— and luckily my quick thinking had paid off. Once again, Surskit was on the move and putting distance between herself and her opponent.\n\n\"Monferno, what are you doing?!\" Liam roared, outraged. \"You had her right there! Don't tell me you're scared of a little water?\"\n\nMonferno's shoulder's sagged slightly, but only for a moment.\n\n\"You shouldn't talk to your pokemon like that!\" I yelled.\n\n\"Mind your own business! Monferno— Use Mach Punch! Again!\"\n\nMonferno again sprinted for Surskit at an alarming speed. Without my ordering it, Surskit began to leave a trail of white light zipping behind her— she had once again used Quick-Attack to evade.\n\nThe gap between Surskit and Monferno began to tighten, and it was clear that Monferno would catch up soon enough.\n\nI bit my lip. We needed to end this game of cat-and-mouse.\n\n\"Surskit, stop!\"\n\nSurskit came to an abrupt halt, sending Monferno toppling over her.\n\n\"Monferno, what the hell?!\" Liam growled. \"Are you serious? Get her!\"\n\nMonferno lunged at Surskit oncemore, but it seemed like his heart wasn't really in it anymore. Surskit easily dodged, shooting a confused glance back at me momentarily.\n\nPoor Monferno, I thought to myself. He was looking tired— and not just physically. I almost regretted having to give my next order.\n\n\"Surskit, Bubble-beam!\"\n\nOnce again, the torrent of bubbles slammed into Monferno's chest, seeing him sway on his feet. The pokemon fell to one knee, before shakily standing up again.\n\n\"You're an evolved pokemon, are you seriously telling me you can't handle that bug?\" Liam jeered.\n\nBooing erupted from the audience as Liam taunted his own pokemon. The referee looked like he wanted to say something, but didn't.\n\nI grit my teeth. It would be better for everyone involved if I just ended this.\n\n\"Surskit, water-gun! Let's finish this!\"\n\nMonferno lunged forward with another half-hearted swing, but before he could close the gap, he was hit squarely with Surskit's Water-gun— which sent him sprawling.\n\nMonferno did not rise again.\n\n\"There you have it folks— Peppa Carmine will advance to the next round!\" The referee called, trying to hype up the audience.\n\nThere were some cheers, but it was clear that not many people were feeling the hype after that display.\n\n\"Now, I'd like for the two of you to shake hands.\" The referee gestured to Liam and I once we had finished recalling our respective pokemon.\n\nI stepped forward, but only because I didn't want to look like a bad sport in front of everyone. \"Good match,\" I ground out, extending my hand to Liam.\n\nLiam took my hand and yanked me towards him, tightening his grip to a near painful degree.\n\n\"Good match,\" he sneered, gripping harder. He clearly intended to hurt me.\n\nA fire ignited in my chest as I pulled him back towards me, tightening my own grip around his wrist.\n\n\"I just want you to know, Liam— you didn't lose because of Monferno. You lost because you're a terrible trainer.\"\n\nLiam's face twisted into a mask of rage, but before he could say anything else, the referee stepped in, pulling us apart.\n\n\"Okay, thats enough.\" The referee whispered away from his microphone. \"Seriously. Don't cause a scene.\"\n\nLiam stared me down for a few seconds longer, before stalking off to the locker rooms.",

Not sure what the people this world are on but bugs are annoying and strong, just usually only something seen early game so they seem weak. Volcarona is an epic bug if you get her a larvesta.\n\nNot sure what your plans going forward but I reckon a wimpod would be an excellent 'weak' mon for her team if you continue the monotype. And if you're going for more spiders then got to get the cutie joltik. There's so many options for a great bug team...
