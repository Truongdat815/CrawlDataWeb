    "description": "It is twenty-two years before the Battle of Yavin, and the galaxy is at war.\n\nBorn to a not unimportant, not important planet in the Inner Rim, Rain never placed much thought into his future. After all, the galaxy is vast, and peaceful living should not be hard to find. Two decades later, armies are marshalled, and warships grace the stars, propelled aloft the wings of war.\n\nArmed with the knowledge of nine movies, Rain is forced into joining the galactic conflict. On the losing side.\n\n*AU with many, many POVs; don't expect a casual self-insert flick",

The details, consistency of the chapters, story, plot, character description, the politics of the star war universe and so on are all really well done.\n\n \n\n Report",
