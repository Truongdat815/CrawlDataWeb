    "description": "After obtaining the Mech Designer System, Ves aims to create the greatest mechs in the galaxy!\nIn the far future, the galactic human civilization has entered the Age of Mechs. The countless lesser powers of humanity have come to adopt mechs as their main weapons of war.\nOnly a small number of humans have the right genetic aptitude to pilot these destructive war machines the size of buildings.\nBorn to a military family in the edge of the galaxy, Ves Larkinson is one of the many people who lacks the talent to earn glory in battle. Instead, he became a mech designer. Helped by his missing father, Ves has obtained the mysterious Mech Designer System that can help him rise in the galaxy and beyond.",

The relaxed and smooth transitions and clear descriptions of the characters, mechs and building processes are amazing to see from someone who is not a professional writer. But all of these pale in comparison to the godly battle scenes in this novel. By far some of the most exciting and powerful battles and battle descriptions I have ever read. Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

The relaxed and smooth transitions and clear descriptions of the characters, mechs and building processes are amazing to see from someone who is not a professional writer.

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

The relaxed and smooth transitions and clear descriptions of the characters, mechs and building processes are amazing to see from someone who is not a professional writer.

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

Even if you don’t normally enjoy mechs you should try this novel.",

            "content": "As a reputable mech simulator, Iron Spirit only featured real mechs. The base designs sold in its virtual store could be bought in real life with almost the same performance. With its vast and extensive database, the game worked hard to group them together in a simple manner.\n\n \n\nThe BSBH Corporation eventually decided to adopt a 1-star to 5-star rating. They later added even higher ratings with the introduction of even higher performing models.\n\n 3\n\nThe game's database included many older designs, but its library of current designs was incomplete. Many top-notch mech designs were highly guarded secrets. These so-called next generation models represented the cutting edge of mech design.\n\n 1\n\nThe Age of Mechs spanned four-hundred years, so the game offered plenty of models even without the latest designs.\n\n 3\n\nIron Spirit's lowest 1-star mech models used to plow the battlefield alongside legends such as Mack Liu, the mech pioneer. Compared to contemporary models, these ancient relics fell short in many ways. They were slow, clumsy, inefficient and sometimes looked ridiculous. When Ves took a peek at these clown-like models, he wondered if their designers had a few screws loose.\n\n 15\n\nSystem's designer mode already loaded one such design. The Fantasia 2R incorporated a radical humanoid design scheme, and was the second iteration of a flawed first edition. The Fantasia massed very little due to its slim and narrow design, allowing it to run faster and longer than the stockier models available at the time. These gains were made at the cost of other parameters such as armor and firepower.\n\n 4\n\nFor whatever reason, the designers shaped the Fantasia 2R in the form of a woman. Its concave torso, sloping breastplate, thin limbs and narrow head evoked the appearance of a supermodel in dressed in skimpy armor.\n\n 24\n\nThe older 1R model already looked like a feminist's worst nightmare. The manufacturers doubled down by attaching hair-like sensor threads on top of the 2R's head. The sensors at least served a practical purpose, since they turned the model into a decent scouting mech.\n\n 8\n\nSince the Fantasia was such a light and thin mech, Ves had very little leeway in modifying its parts without destroying its good points.\n\n 7\n\nIn contrast, Ves could easily tinker with heavier models, shaving ten percent of its mass without sacrificing too much of its defense. After applying modern techniques to the ancient design, he could easily raise the performance of his variant by two or three percent compared to its base model.\n\n \n\n\"This Fantasia the System provided me is really too skinny.\"\n\n \n\nSince he couldn't go for the route of subtraction, he needed to find another way to add value. Ves could easily improve the design by adding additional components. Unfortunately, the System only provided the license of a single component, giving him very little options.\n\n 7\n\nThe virtual component license the System gifted him came with an overly lengthy name. The creators called it the Gemini twin rear ejection energy booster.\n\n 12\n\nThe complicated component did three things at once. First, it allowed a cockpit to eject from the rear in case of emergencies. It provided a fairly large amount of energy storage, allowing mechs to last longer without resupply. Lastly, it provided a large amount of straight-line acceleration with its boosters, though such boosts consumed a lot of energy.\n\n 4\n\nNormally, such attributes matched perfectly with the Fantasia 2R's focus on speed. There was only one major snag. The Gemini's dimensions were drastically over sized.\n\n \n\nThe Gemini had been designed to accommodate the first heavy mech in existence, the Megacrab. This mech was a behemoth that required eight legs and twin cockpits for two pilots.\n\n 11\n\nTrying to affix the Gemini system to the Fantasia 2R was like trying to put a stuffed backpack onto a clueless toddler.\n\n 3\n\n\"If only I had more assets. I can't do much without more licenses. I'm not good enough to modify the base design extensively.\"\n\n \n\nVes tinkered with the System's designer functionality. Surprisingly, he found it remarkably easy to implement his modifications. The design tools responded to his thoughts alone, cutting back errors resulting from unsteady hands or faulty calculations. The designer's assistance to his work was like adding wings to a tiger.\n\n 11\n\nDespite his enjoyment, Ves found it hard to wrap up a finished design in a single day. He reluctantly shut down the Mech Designer System and took care of his needs. He gobbled up a cheap nutrient pack and cuddled his new pet to sleep in an unfamiliar bed.\n\n 6\n\nVes wrestled with the problem for three more days. He spent most of the time trying various ways to combine the hefty Gemini add-on to the thin and wispy Fantasia frame. From a total of seventeen attempts, he outright failed fifteen times, leaving only a couple of barely functional designs.\n\n \n\nWhen he projected the design in all of its glory, he felt like finding a hole to burrow into. It looked ridiculous!\n\n 1\n\nVes had attached the Gemini to the rear of the frame. It sounded simple, but the Fantasia's various restrictions made it a tricky problem. The profile of the 2R's lower torso was so thin that the Gemini simply couldn't be attached to that location. He already tried to do so several times.\n\n 1\n\nFrom his many attempts, Ves concluded he could only attach the Gemini onto the upper back or the lower waist. Since placing such a heavy add-on too high would severely unbalance the Fantasia to the point of tipping it over, Ves could only add the Gemini onto the Fantasia's waist.\n\n 10\n\nThe combination looked obscene. His cheeks turned red as he beheld the model's mock-up. Its only saving grace was that the custom design had improved on some points. Though the mech became heavier and less agile with the addition of such an uneven weight, its straight-line traveling speed rocketed upwards.\n\n 3\n\nThe pilot also enjoyed a massive increase in safety with the improved cockpit ejection system. It could eject both cockpits at once, one real and one decoy. This provided a marginal benefit in Iron Spirit, as a successful ejection lowered the cost of repairing a defeated mech in the game.\n\n 2\n\n\"Alright System, does my first design make the cut?\"\n\n 1\n\n[Scanning design. Simulating performance. Completed. Do you wish to name the design?]\n\n \n\n\"Let's go with Fantasia 2R-E. My variant's rear end is the only thing that's improved.\"\n\n 5\n\n[Design Evaluation: Fantasia 2R-E.]\n\n \n\nVariant name: Fantasia 2R-E\n\n \n\nBase model: Fantasia 2R\n\n \n\nOriginal Manufacturer: Kezia Armaments\n\n \n\nWeight Classification: Medium-Light\n\n \n\nRecommended Role: Sprinter/Harasser\n\n 9\n\nArmor: F\n\n \n\nCarrying Capacity: F\n\n \n\nAesthetics: A-\n\n 17\n\nEndurance: C+\n\n \n\nEnergy Efficiency: C\n\n \n\nFlexibility: D-\n\n \n\nFirepower: D+\n\n \n\nIntegrity: E\n\n 3\n\nMobility: B+\n\n \n\nSpotting: B\n\n \n\nX-Factor: None\n\n 12\n\nDeviance: 23%\n\n 2\n\nPerformance improvement: 4.5%\n\n \n\nOverall evaluation: Horribly overweight for its intended purpose, the Fantasia 2R-E is nevertheless redeemed by its amplified power and forward potential. Its improvement in open terrain and long-distance missions does not outweigh its anemic flexibility and horrible performance in close-quarters combat. The model's unique appearance may appeal to a small sub-set of pilots.\n\n 17\n\n[You have received 1 Design Point for completing an original design.]\n\n 12\n\n[Congratulations on completing the first part of the tutorial. The rewards have been sent to your inventory. You have also received a bonus for exceeding the requirements of the mission.]\n\n \n\nVes sighed in relief. He had worked hard to merge two entirely different things together. While he succeeded on a fluke, he still managed to pull through.\n\n \n\nNow that he finished this ungodly mission, he could move on and forget this abomination of a mech. He wiped away the projection of the design and opened his inventory. Two gift-wrapped packages awaited his eager fingers. Ves quickly tapped both icons, letting them unbox together.\n\n 3\n\n[You have received a virtual license for the following mech: Kezia Armaments Fantasia 2R.]\n\n \n\n[You have received a virtual license for the following component: Maxodron Gemini twin rear ejection energy booster.]\n\n \n\n\"Really?! You're giving me the same stuff I've been torturing myself for three entire days?\"\n\n 2\n\n[You have received a new mission. Please read the details in the Missions page.]\n\n \n\n[Mission]\n\n \n\nMission: Tutorial Part 2 - Your First Sale\n\n \n\nDifficulty: F-Rank\n\n \n\nPrerequisites: Completed Tutorial Part 1\n\n \n\nDescription\n\n \n\nYou cannot call yourself a proper mech designer if your design isn't used. Please endeavor to sell a mech based on your first design.\n\n \n\nReward: 1,000 Design Points\n\n 1\n\n\"You're setting me up, System! Even if I can find someone stupid enough to buy the 2R-E, I still don't have the credits to purchase the raw materials. Iron Spirit doesn't let designers fabricate a virtual mech for free even if I possess the necessary licences.\"\n\n 2\n\nThe game taxed mech designers by charging them for the raw materials.\n\n \n\n[You have forgotten your bonus. Please look at the currency tab in your inventory.]\n\n 2\n\nA red packet awaited Ves when he switched his view. He tapped it, causing the the virtual envelope to unfold into imaginary bills. It eventually landed into a neat stack with the total amount displayed on top.\n\n \n\n[Congratulations for receiving 100,000 bright credits.]\n\n 10\n\nVes widened his eyes. Exceeding the expectations of the system provided considerable rewards. With the sudden windfall, he had a lot more options to earn money now. While a hundred thousand credits might not let him purchase a license for another mech, he could still purchase plenty of cheap components such as armor plating, cooling systems, batteries and even weapons.\n\n \n\nBefore Ves put his newly gained credits to good use, he first made sure to complete the mission.\n\n \n\nHe uploaded the saved design of the 2R-E onto Iron Spirit's virtual workshop. He then spent about ten-thousand credits collecting the raw materials required to fabricate the design. While he could spend twice as much to let the game fabricate the design automatically, Ves wanted to save every single credit so he went for manual assembly.\n\n \n\nVes spent two days fumbling around the virtual workshop's 3D printer to print all the required parts. He then took three more days fumbling around the assembler trying to put all the diverse and heavy parts together. Somehow, Ves felt a little closer to his first creation as he finally clicked the final part together. He even took some time and credits to paint the chassis purple and red.\n\n 11\n\n\"You're not the prettiest girl, but you're my first.\" Ves shook his head. \"That sounds wrong.\"\n\n 99+\n\nWhile trying to erase the unpleasant image of mech-human romance from his mind, he quickly put the finished model onto the market.\n\n 31\n\nHe didn't choose to sell the virtual mech for real credits, though the option was available. Practically all low tier mechs in Iron Spirit were sold in gold, the in-game currency that mech pilots earned when they won matches against their opponents. The market set a minimum price of 1600 gold, reflecting the cost of raw materials if Ves had paid for them in gold.\n\n 2\n\n\"I'm not stupid enough to sell it at cost. Let's add a hundred gold. My labor's has got to be worth something.\"\n\n 4\n\nJust after he finished with the lot, he also checked his user profile. He chose to hide his real name for now. It wouldn't do for his future career in mech design to be tainted with this awful design. He casually set his nickname as Chasing Clouds, as a reference to his home planet and his aspirations.\n\n 25\n\nWith that chore done, Ves threw the mission to the back of his mind and went to the Mech section of the market.\n\n \n\nHe browsed all of the available variants of the Fantasia 2R. If he wanted to design a competitive but affordable Fantasia model, he needed to do his research on what the market already offered. He could then tailor a list of requirements and scour the market for fitting components.\n\n 2\n\nVes sunk into his work. He fell into the enthusiasm starting his career in mech design. Even if designing virtual mechs for a game didn't bestow him with the qualifications of a real mech designer, he could still polish his basic skills. Once he accomplished a handful of sales, he could purchase better licenses and design better variants.\n\n \n\n\"Still, I can't play with virtual mechs forever. There's no way I can earn enough credits to meet my next interest payment.\"\n\n \n\nHe needed to earn enough credits to fund the operations of his real mech business. If the expensive fixed cost of purchasing licences was left out, then he could easily make the deadline. Reality wasn't so kind.\n\n 2\n\n\"Virtual licences only apply to in-game designs. There's no way I can afford a legitimate production licence with my current assets.\"\n\n 1\n\nActual production licences came with prohibitive costs and restrictions. For the privilege of using another company's intellectual property, Ves had to pay a high price. He also had to give the original owners a cut of his earnings.\n\n 8\n\nAlong with the cost of raw materials, profits grew thin.\n\n \n\n\"It's impossible to make it without the help of the System. I hope the 2R-E is going to sell out quickly, because I have a feeling I'm going to need all the Design Points I can get.\"\n\n \n\nLucky sauntered over and meowed at Ves.\n\n \n\n\"What's up buddy?\"\n\n 2\n\nThe cat tugged at Ves' pants and tried to lead him outside. Curious, Ves followed the mischievous cat outside and spotted something sparkling behind the weeds. Ves came close and picked it up, revealing a green gemstone. Upon realizing its significance, he hurriedly dropped it down.\n\n \n\n\"Even if you're a machine, I'm still not touching your crap.\" Ves told the cunning cat.\n\n 4\n\nHe scanned the gem according to the System's instructions.\n\n \n\n[Emerald of Minor Armor]\n\n 3\n\nIncreases the durability of a mech's armor plates by 0.5% when installed.\n\n \n\nFor a gem of its size, its effects were heaven-defying. Despite the paltry boost, the gem cost nothing to make. If he kept feeding Lucky the same cheap ore, he could end up with a pile of emeralds. If they all had the same effect, they might accomplish something great if combined.\n\n \n\n\"System, if I have two of the same gems, do their benefits stack?\"\n\n \n\n[Of course not. A mech can only benefit from a limited amount of gems. Gemstones that provide the same effects do not provide more benefits when put into the same mech.]\n\n 4\n\nEvery time the System hinted at something amazing, it turned out to be limited.\n\n \n\n\"I need to feed my cat something better.\" Ves muttered and resolved to order something better and have it delivered to his workshop tomorrow.\n\n 8\n\nUnknown to Ves, on the other side of Cloudy Curtain, a certain twelve-year old potentate sat down in a fully-enclosed simulator. He had just finished school and rented a sim pod from the local gaming center downtown.\n\n 10\n\nThe boy avidly played Iron Spirit ever since he recently finished his basic lessons on mech piloting. It hardly turned him into a qualified pilot, but it allowed him to pass the minimum requirements to finally play the game.\n\n 1\n\nCalling himself Shifter66 in the game, he enjoyed piloting faster mechs. There was something about running in a multi-ton machine that charmed him. Playing the heavier mechs bored him to tears. He preferred to be quick on his feet, pestering enemies and dodging shots rather than slugging it out in a head-on collision.\n\n 14\n\nAs a twelve-year old, he couldn't lay any claim to greatness, but he thought he possessed a solid foundation in piloting the simplest of 1-star mechs. He played a couple of hundred matches, and while he lost most of them, he still managed to put together a few thousand gold for a new purchase.\n\n \n\nWhen Shifter66 visited the game's online market, he somehow wavered his attention to a line of feminine models. A young man like him already started to pay some attention to the girls in his school. He channeled that energy to the graceful models on display. He picked a random direction to explore further, coming upon the old but still fairly popular Fantasia series.\n\n 6\n\nWhile the boy only halfheartedly inspected the models, he made an abrupt stop once the random selection displayed a highly unusual variant. The boy held out his palm, freezing the image and allowing him to look at the model in greater detail.\n\n 5\n\n[Fantasia 2R-E]\n\n \n\nTier: 1-star\n\n \n\nBase Model: Fantasia 2R\n\n \n\nPurchase price: 1,700 gold\n\n \n\n\"She looks perfect!\"\n\n 33\n\nA more demanding mech pilot might comment that the mech looked horribly out of balance. Any sane pilot might also complain that the added weight of the variant's rear addition served to slow it down to the point of making the mech useless in any short-distance engagements.\n\n 7\n\nShifter66 on the other hand kept his eyes glued to the rear end. \"I gotta have it!\"\n\n 44\n\nAnd so Ves' first mech got sold.\n\n 6\nCOMMENT\n301 comment\n \nVote\n1 left\n \nSEND GIFT",

            "content": "Joshua drained the energy drink down his throat and tossed the can to the ground. A cleaning bot appeared out of nowhere to take the garbage away.\n\nAn elegant woman entered the foyer whilst carrying a babbling toddler. She approached the teenager and gave him a kiss on his forehead. \"Joshie baby! How was school.\"\n\n\"I'm not a kid anymore, mom!\" Joshua whined as he avoided his mother's embrace. He ran up the stairs to his room. \"And I did fine in school. My mech trainer complimented me again today.\"\n\n\"That's good news. The higher your performance, the higher your rank when you become a reservist. Just don't join the Mech Corps.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to mom.\" Joshua said as he threw his bag on his bed. \"I'm going to play with the simulator again, okay?\"\n\n\"Don't forget about dinner again.\"\n\nAfter fending off his nagging mother, Joshua left his room and went downstairs. He took two flights down and entered the basement. Situated in a cooled and isolated room was his personal mech simulator pod for Iron Spirit. An expensive piece of machinery, it outperformed the rental pods at the game center. His parents even forked out the money to dig a secure set of cables to the nearest galactic net node in order to ensure his bandwidth never conked out. All of this turned Joshua's pod into the best performing unit on Cloudy Curtain.\n\nAs Joshua entered the pod and let it close around him, he leaned his head back into the headrest that served as the neural interface. It hummed as it came to life, connecting Joshua's brain signals to the programs executed by the pod.\n\nThe world changed. The cool steel walls of the simulator pod made way for a vibrant world. Many young men and women around his age walked through the digital streets of the starting area. Some sat next to fountains, watching the live streams of popular players that chose to broadcast in public. Others entered one of the many stores in order to shop for a new outfit.\n\nAs for Joshua, he pulled up his friends list and tapped at one of the names to begin a dialogue.\n\n\"Heya Snake.\" Triceratopssss greeted as his face appeared at the corner of Joshua's view. \"Up for another bout of Arena?\"\n\nJoshua shook his head. \"Hmmm I don't feel like it. The 1v1s and 2v2s have been getting kind of stale for me lately. I'm ready for something different.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Triceratopssss mulled as he switched to matchmaking. \"You wanna play Capture the Flag or Base Conquest?\"\n\n\"Let's do Capture the Flag. It's 5v5 so I feel my skill still matters in that game mode.\"\n\nThe two paired up and entered matchmaking for Capture the Flag as a duo. They first received three random players to fill up their 5-man team.\n\n\"Hey fellas.\" Triceratopssss greeted his new teammates. \"Me and Snake here are pairing up as light mechs.\"\n\n\"Medium missile platform.\" The third player spoke, his tone conveying his distaste in further interaction.\n\n\"O-kay. What about the rest?\"\n\n\"Heavy Knight. Just plant me next to our flag and I'll make sure anyone who takes it will be dead.\" The fourth player boasted. Defending the flag was the most traditional role in Capture the Flag and perfect for a heavy mech.\n\n\"Got any guns on your knight?\"\n\n\"Nope. But I'm faster than other knights.\"\n\n\"Great.\" Triceratopssss sighed. \"At least you can chase the enemy if someone manages to steal the flag from underneath us. So what about the last guy?\"\n\n\"I'm a girl thank you.\" The young woman emphasized with a sneer. \"You just get out of my way. If you must know, I'm piloting a Genesis-18.\"\n\n\"The medium spider mech?\"\n\n\"So you do have more than three brain cells! Congratulations doofus.\"\n\n\"Haha.\" Triceratopssss deadpanned. \"Well, our team's a little light on weight, but we're very mobile. Let's do a 4-1.\"\n\n\"3-2.\" The missileer interjected. \"My mech's a glass cannon. I'm best at supporting the heavy knight and providing long-range missile support.\"\n\n\"I'm attacking from the rear.\" The spider girl said. \"I work best if I can sneak up to them alone, so don't you dare follow me.\"\n\nTriceratopssss sighed again. Joshua, or TheSeventhSnake consoled him in a private chat. \"Don't bother too much. Getting to your teammates work together like we learned at school doesn't always work. A lot of players just want to blow off steam.\"\n\n\"God, I hope they make an effort then. My win rate for Capture the Flag is already in the dump due to getting teamed up with egoistic morons.\"\n\nThe matchmaking system released a bell, signifying a successful search of an opposing team. The screen changed into a small lobby where their team could inspect the enemy's loadout while the random battlefield loaded in the background.\n\nTheSeventhSnake analyzed the enemy's team composition and felt a headache forming. \"The enemy team has a three-person premade. They're all kitted with the same heavy mechs.\"\n\nHe didn't recognize the variants, but they looked a lot like the strikers he fought the other day.\n\n\"One of them carries a bunch of close-ranged heat projectors. The other transformed his arms into medium-ranged ballistic cannons. The last guy appears to be their long-ranged marksman with his jumbo-sized laser rifle.\"\n\nIt was a composition that lacked mobility but possessed power in spades. Relying on their tough armor and plentiful energy reserves, they could bulldoze anything in their way.\n\n\"The two randoms pulled in their team adjusted to the trio and came with their light mechs.\" Triceratopssss noted. \"One aerial scout and one saboteur. That's plenty of mobility for them to plug their gaps.\"\n\nTheSeventhSnake shook his head. \"Not really. You can be sure the three meatheads will stick together. We're either going to face a heavy push or a full-on defense.\"\n\n\"If they keep turtle up in their base, I can bombard them with impunity behind a hill.\" The missileer said curtly.\n\n\"And if their team attacks, their flag will only be defended by two lights.\"\n\nThe map finished loading, causing everyone to appear in a small open fort. A lengthy flagpole stuck out from the middle of the parade ground.\n\n\"Alright, let's move.\"\n\nThe spider mech girl crawled over the walls with her eight limbs and disappeared from their view. The missileer took off in the other direction while the heavy knight planted its feet right next to the flag.\n\nTriceratopssss followed TheSeventhSnake on the ground as he flew up in the air.\n\n\"The first thing we need to do is find the three heavies and figure out what they're up to.\" TheSeventhSnake spoke to his fellow teammates. \"Me and Tops will scout the enemy first.\"\n\nAs a flyer, Snake's Seraphim traversed the forest prairie environment with effortless grace. Tops' Phantasm could only slink through the trees a third as fast. However, the ground mech was able to minimize its emissions to stay hidden while the flier radiated heat and also color as its iconic cloud generator spewed clouds of vapor.\n\nTheSeventhSnake didn't care if he got spotted by the enemy first. Even as his Seraphim extended its sensor hair in the flowing wind, he was pretty much waiting to get shot at. After piloting the Seraphim for many hours, he grew confident in his ability to dodge.\n\n\"Hm?\" TheSeventhSnake got distracted as a strange notification popped up. \"Someone is spectating me? That's strange. Oh well, as long as he isn't feeding information to my opponents, I don't care.\"\n\nA barrage of laser fire shot from a cloud. Some of the beams scorched TheSeventhSnake's armor, thankfully not damaging anything essential.\n\n\"I'm under fire by their air scout! Engaging! Tops, keep searching for their heavies, don't let this distraction fool you!\"\n\nTriceratopssss nodded as his Phantasm kept combing the surrounding area. \"Roger that, pal.\"\n\n\"My ground-to-air missiles are ready to fire.\" The missileer interrupted. \"Maintain contact and feed your target lock to me.\"\n\n\"No, stay out of this fight. I can handle this fellow myself. Don't reveal your position.\"\n\nThe Seraphim flared its wings and juked side to side as it fired back with its light DMR. The jerky lateral movements made it hard to hit by the enemy lightweight, but the long-ranged rifle also scored very little hits.\n\nThat was okay, because Snake increased his speed and approached with fury. His heart pumped faster and his brain went into a heightened state. His Seraphim holstered the rifle on his back, which was difficult with the wings in the way, and retrieved a pair of heated knives. Like the fangs of a predator, he wielded them in a reserve grip and rocketed in a charging attack towards the enemy flier.\n\nThe enemy mech panicked a bit as it had been loaded for long-to-medium range harassment. The pilot felt much less confident in melee than the enemy's so he flew back and engaged his mech's thrusters in order to escape the approaching rainbow mech.\n\n\"Death!\" TheSeventhSnake yelled as he exerted his Seraphim to the utmost, managing to slowly close the distance at the cost of overheating his mech's wings. \"I can take it! My mech is meant to rule the skies!\"\n\nThe enemy mech dove downwards in order to gain more speed and perhaps seek help from its allies on the ground. However, the Seraphim anticipated the move and accelerated just a split-second earlier. The brilliant decision allowed it to close the distance just enough for Snake to feel the opposing mech's heat.\n\nThe light mech gave up escape and flipped in the air, presenting its medium-powered laser rifle at him. The Seraphim crossed its arms just as the lasers pelted its form, causing a lot more spots to blacken and melt away. The enemy mech evidently overheated its rifle, sacrificing its endurance for a massive boost in firepower.\n\n\"It's too late!\" Snake yelled as he made his Seraphim spin. The rotation allowed it to dodge the last set of lasers while adding momentum to its poised and outstretched knives.\n\nThe light mech extended its rifle in desperation, blocking with its bulk. One heated knife snapped right through its body, shearing the weapon into slag. The other knife passed around the weapon and scored a deep blow in the shoulder, practically crippling the mech's left arm.\n\nThe Seraphim finished delivering its attacks, leaving it open for the light mech's kick. The feeble attack hardly damaged the Seraphim, but it successfully pushed it away, leaving the half-crippled mech enough space to continue to fall.\n\nInstead of chasing after its prey, the Seraphim holstered its knives and brought its rifle back to its arms. With a calm and steady aim, the Seraphim fired a constant stream of energy bolts.\n\nThe first bolts went wide, but as the light mech failed to adjust in time, the next bolts hit its wings. The damage was light, but it disrupted the operation of its wings. The light mech posed an easier target now that its speed reduced. The subsequent energy bolts shredded the rest of the light mech's wings, leaving it incapable of correcting its fall.\n\n\"Their aerial scout is doomed.\" TheSeventhSnake stated as he watched the smoking mech crash into the ground and explode. \"What's the situation down on the ground?\"\n\n\"Their saboteur is good!\" The spider mech girl responded. \"He got two of my legs, but he hasn't come out unscathed. Don't bother me. Lemme focus on the duel.\"\n\n\"Their heavies are attacking our base! I'm having a hard time keeping them off our flag!\" The heavy knight gasped. \"Mister missile fan is helping, but I really need more help!\"\n\nTriceratopssss also filled in his status. \"I've taken their flag since spider mech is doing a good job keeping their remaining light mech occupied. I can either help her out or go back to base. I won't be able to deliver the flag with the heavy boys around.\"\n\n\"Return to base. We need to destroy at least two out of three of those heavies in order to give you an opening to deliver the flag.\"\n\nThe Seraphim flew back to base while the flag-carrying Phantasm ran across the terrain while holding a large flag. TheSeventhSnake assessed his mech's damage and energy reserves, and concluded it could withstand one more all-in assault.\n\n\"Damnit! They got my sword arm! I'm only left with my shield now.\"\n\n\"Hang on, I'm coming!\" TheSeventhSnake responded as he broke through the clouds and flew over his team's base. His sensors rapidly detected the glowing hot forms of the enemy trio.\n\nThe close-ranged heat projecting enemy pinned down the heavy knight whilst slowly melting its armor. The medium-ranged ballistic gunner had succeeded in blowing off the heavy knight's sword arm and now went to work on its legs. As for the long-ranged marksman, it had already circled round the sides to suppress their missileer.\n\nTo his credit, the missileer used its superior mobility to stay one step ahead of the enemy marksman, taking advantage of the surrounding hills to keep out of its line of sight. All the while, it fired sporadic volleys of arcing missiles onto the other two heavy mechs with the help of the telemetry the heavy knight sent back. The missiles hadn't inflicted any critical damage to the two mechs, but the frequent explosions degraded their sensors and stripped much of their top-facing armor.\n\nThe two bruisers were so engrossed in bullying the heavy knight that the Seraphim was practically able to position itself at their rear. It then dove down in a heart-stopping powered fall.\n\nTheSeventhSnake overcharged his DMR, causing its chamber to accumulate so much energy that smoke started to escape. He even overloaded his rear-side cloud generator so that it created a vast rainbow wake that approached the unsuspecting two mechs like the front of a tsunami.\n\nThe heavy knight's facing allowed it to see the oncoming attack, and fell slack for a second, which proved to be a fatal mistake as a cannon shell ripped apart its right leg, causing the mech to lose its balance. The heat projecting mech pounced on the vulnerability while the cannoneer reloaded its shells with the confidence his target was already dead.\n\nJust as it was in the middle of swapping its magazine, the cannoneer somehow felt an invisible pressure form from its rear. After switching to the rear sensor feeds, it suddenly noticed a gigantic attack coming from the air.\n\n\"DEATH!\" TheSeventhSnake bellowed as he aimed and fired a humongous energy bolt at the flat-footed cannon mech. The bolt zapped through the air like a hot knife through butter. The huge ball of energy splashed against the mech's rifle, coincidentally also damaging its magazine, causing it to explode in a devastating ripple. The bolt fell apart with most of its energy dispersing in the air, but some of the damage landed on the mech's front, ruining its surface internals.\n\nTheSeventhSnake had already decoupled and tossed aside his slagged rifle. With his twin heated knives he struck the damaged and bleeding mech in its head and upper torso. He landed with so much momentum behind him that the knives tore through the remnants of the heavy mech's armor and ruined several of its critical systems, the most important of which was the power reactor embedded near the heart area.\n\nThe Cannoneer, now cut off from power, shut itself off. Snake's Seraphim landed its delicate legs against the disabled mech's chest and bent its knees to mitigate its falling momentum.\n\nThat left it open to the remaining heavy mech. The heat projector ignored the heavy knight that had been slagged into a molten statue, and ran back to avenge his comrade. With his Seraphim already running hot like an oven, even a glancing hit by the wide-area heat projectors could cause Snake to be boiled alive in his own mech.\n\nAcutely aware of the impending crisis, TheSeventhSnake acted in desperation. In a feat of exemplary control, the Seraphim spread its legs like a stripper and leveraged its grip on the embedded knives to spin around the unpowered mech's torso.\n\nThe air flashed with white-hot heat and the projectors fired. The cannon mech's ruined armor suffered a catastrophic amount of damage while some of its internals even caught fire. The Seraphim's exposed legs also melted into a half-puddle shape, rendering them incapable of supporting the light mech's weight.\n\nHowever, TheSeventhSnake managed to preserve his mech's waist and upper body. The Seraphim leaned over, using the burning cannonneer as a shield, and did something stupid. It threw its knives at its opponent. The heat projecting mech got startled and hastily tried to angle its armor against the incoming projectiles, only for them to fall short and land on the ground.\n\nThe heat projector grew enraged, and stomped over with his lumbering mech while firing its heat weapon without regard. TheSeventhSnake continued to make his mech hug the increasingly hotter cannon mech, hoping desperately that it would last.\n\nThe heat projector inadvertently walked away from the center. This left the waiting Triceratopssss a narrow window of approach. His Phantasm swiftly but quietly climbed over the walls of their fort and made a beeline to the center where his own team's flag also rested.\n\nNoticing his mistake, the heat projector's pilot commanded his mech to turn its torso. With his pair of heat projectors poised to fire, the Phantasm was bound to suffer greatly.\n\nThat was until TheSeventhSnake managed to pry off his battered and half-molten Seraphim away from its shield. With a disabled pair of legs, the Seraphim nevertheless crawled forward with all the strength its feeble arms could muster. It approached underneath the distracted heavy mech and reached out to grab on the heat projectors.\n\nThe Seraphim succeeded in spoiling one of the heat projector's aim. It unleashed much of its molten fury harmlessly against the ground.\n\nThe other heat projector succeeded in hitting the Phantasm. However, the Phantasm suffered no damage beforehand, and with only one projector achieving a hit, the Phantasm maintained its ability to move. With a limping run, Triceratopssss succeeded in planting the enemy's flag right next to their team's unconquered banner.\n\n\"You interrrupted my duel!\"\n\nWhile his teammates cheered and grumbled, TheSeventhSnake sank back in his cockpit with a satisfied expression. He could feel the victory invigorating him even as he felt as if the excessive heat had cooked him into a crispy state.\n\n\"We won...\" TheSeventhSnake smiled as he let out a warm and deep breath. \"I'm getting better at this, though my Seraphim won't be happy I trashed it again.\"\n\nThen he remembered someone had spectated him throughout the entire match. TheSeventhSnake opened his personal page and switched to his stream. He read out the name of his only spectator.\n\n\"Chasing Clouds. That sounds familiar...\"",
