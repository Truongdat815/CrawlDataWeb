    "description": "Romance: Taylor Swift\nWhat if you woke up in 2007 and became teammates with a young Kevin Durant at the University of Texas?\nFor Chen Yan, this isn’t a dream—it’s his new reality.\nWith the activation of the [Strongest Basketball Plugin], he instantly integrates the legendary Allen Iverson Template. Handles, speed, swagger—he’s got it all. But unlike Iverson, Chen Yan stands taller, stronger, and just as relentless.\nIverson: \"He’s got everything I had… but in a bigger frame!\"\nKobe: \"This kid makes me want to fight harder. I live for games against him!\"\nReporter: \"Michael, how would you describe Chen Yan?\"\nJordan: \"Elite skills. Elite body. Elite will to win.\"\nReporter: \"And after that?\"\nJordan: \"After that… the NBA’s over.\"\nFrom the madness of March to the bright lights of the NBA, follow the rise of a new basketball legend who rewrites history, breaks records, and challenges icons. When the court becomes his kingdom, only one question remains—\nCan anyone stop Chen Yan?",

            "content": "Chapter 10: Big Win and Promotion! The Three of Us Are Just Built Different!\n\n \n\nAfter a quick fifteen-minute halftime break, the two teams switched sides and got back to work.\n\n \n\nRight off the jump, Taj Gibson threw down a two-handed slam in the paint.\n\n \n\nThen Nick Young followed up with a smooth layup after a clean screen.\n\n \n\nThe adjustment during halftime clearly fired up the University of Southern California squad. They came out swinging with renewed energy, determined to close the gap!\n\n \n\nThis was March Madness, the biggest stage every NCAA baller dreams of. Ain't no one going down without a fight here.\n\n \n\n\"The Trojans are heating up on offense this half,\" the on-site commentator shouted, \"but their real problem isn't scoring... it's defense! They've got no answers for Durant and Chen Yan!\"\n\n \n\nTexas took over possession.\n\n \n\nDamian James stepped up to the high post, ready to set a screen for Chen Yan.\n\n \n\nThe screen itself? Meh, nothing fancy. Nick Young was already slipping past Damian. But Chen Yan didn't care—he blew by Nick anyway, using that killer speed to gain a half-step advantage and explode into the paint!\n\n \n\nNow it was just him and Taj Gibson under the basket.\n\n \n\nIf this was a perimeter play, Gibson wouldn't stand a chance. Chen had too much speed, too much handle—he could kill him a hundred ways from outside.\n\n \n\nBut this was the restricted area. Gibson wasn't backing down. He was a bouncy, energetic role player. If Chen tried to finish at the rim, Taj was gonna try to make him regret it.\n\n \n\nJust outside the paint, Chen suddenly shifted gears and hit the gas again.\n\n \n\nFirst step—right!\n\n \n\nTaj bit hard, shifting left, prepping to leap for a block.\n\n \n\nBut before he could even leave the ground, Chen hit him with the second step—left!\n\n \n\n[Phantom Step] activated.\n\n \n\nGibson was completely stunned. Frozen. Like he got hit with a pause button.\n\n \n\nBy the time he snapped out of it, Chen had already glided past and laid it in easy.\n\n \n\n\"Whoa! New move alert! Chen just pulled out some ghostly footwork!\"\n\n \n\n\"That step was unreal! Like a streak of light cutting straight through the USC's D!\"\n\n \n\nThe commentators were going wild, practically spitting into their mics.\n\n \n\nChen's playstyle was flashy, explosive, and crazy fun to watch. He was the kind of player that made highlight reels write themselves. Even the commentators couldn't get enough.\n\n \n\n\"Chen! Where'd you learn that move?\" Durant ran up, grinning and slapping Chen a high five. \"You never used that in practice!\"\n\n \n\n\"Learn? Come on,\" Chen laughed, \"It's just a Z-step layup. You know, three steps with some sauce.\"\n\n \n\nTo Chen, all that so-called Phantom Step or Eurostep stuff was just a zigzag layup with a little flair.\n\n \n\n\"Teach me that next time, bro.\"\n\n \n\n\"Bet. Anytime.\"\n\n \n\nDurant didn't have the deepest bag in college yet, but he was a grinder. Once he hit the league, his work ethic took him to a whole new level. That's how he became such an offensive monster in the future.\n\n 2\n\nBack on defense, USC had the ball again.\n\n \n\nGibson and Nick Young ran a pick-and-roll. Gibson rolled to the basket, but Damian James straight-up ignored him and double-teamed Nick with Chen.\n\n \n\n\"Ball! Ball!\" Gibson yelled. The paint was wide open.\n\n \n\nBut Nick Young? He'd already slammed the \"I'm shooting no matter what\" button before tip-off. Passing was not in his plans.\n\n 1\n\nWith two defenders on him, he still pulled up for a fadeaway jumper.\n\n \n\nClang!\n\n \n\nThe cooler the shot looks, the louder the brick sounds.\n\n \n\nGood thing Gibson was chill. Anyone else would've subbed themselves out after that nonsense.\n\n \n\nThe ball bounced right into Durant's hands.\n\n \n\nDurant didn't waste a second. He turned and found Chen sprinting ahead.\n\n \n\nChen caught the pass and took off on the break. Damian trailed him, and only Nick Young made it back in time for USC.\n\n \n\nIt was a 2-on-1 fast break!\n\n \n\nChen could've passed it—but he didn't need to.\n\n \n\nNick Young stepped up to contest. Chen went straight into his bag.\n\n \n\nAs Nick's weight shifted left, Chen pulled it back and exploded with a long second step!\n\n \n\nBlew right past Nick's body and went for a clean reverse layup.\n\n \n\nDidn't even give Nick a chance to foul him.\n\n \n\nSame move. Same steps. Same result.\n\n \n\nOnly difference? Taj Gibson was frozen solid earlier.\n\n \n\nNick Young? He spun himself into a full 360, looking like he just got crossed into another timeline.\n\n \n\n\"Ohhh!! Nick Young just got hit with the dance step special!\"\n\n \n\n\"Hey, at least he tried! You gotta give him that.\"\n\n \n\n\"Chen's steps are too long, man. That first burst? Explosive. You can't react fast enough.\"\n\n \n\n\"Damn… seeing that move twice in a row? What did we do to deserve this blessing?\"\n\n \n\nThe crowd erupted again as the arena buzzed with excitement.\n\n \n\nChen Yan's footwork had everyone talking—and Southern California didn't have a single answer.\n\n \n\nMany people had never seen Chen Yan play before, but after tonight's game? Everyone in the arena would remember that name for damn sure.\n\n \n\nThe head coach of the University of Southern California didn't hesitate—timeout!\n\n \n\nAs the players walked back to the bench, Chen Yan tilted his head up and glanced at the replay on the massive jumbotron. That ghost-like footwork he just pulled off? Smooth as hell.\n\n \n\nHe wasn't being cocky—it really was that clean. Both stylish and effective. No wonder Dwyane Wade called it his killer move.\n\n \n\n\"Damn,\" Chen Yan muttered under his breath. \"That was nasty…\"\n\n \n\nAfter the timeout, Texas went right back into their rhythm on offense.\n\n \n\nDurant, who'd been a bit quiet in the second half, suddenly lit up. Jumper after jumper—swish after swish. In the NCAA, if Durant got you one-on-one, it was a wrap. Unstoppable.\n\n \n\nNormally, teams tried to slow him down with double-teams. USC had that same plan going into the game, but Chen Yan completely messed that strategy up.\n\n \n\nWith Chen on the court, USC didn't dare double Durant anymore. One misstep and Chen would slice right through their defense. And with Durant draining shots, it created even more space for Chen to attack.\n\n \n\nThey didn't even need to run pick-and-rolls or complex sets. Their presence alone made each other better. The synergy? Off the charts.\n\n \n\nCoach Rick Barnes was watching closely from the sideline. He didn't say anything, but in his mind? The decision was made.\n\n \n\n\"Next game, Chen's starting.\"\n\n \n\nThen—\n\n \n\n\"Ball stolen!\"\n\n \n\nThe commentator's voice cracked with excitement.\n\n \n\nChen Yan leapt into the passing lane, snatching a lazy lateral pass like a hawk. Without hesitation, he exploded into a fast break!\n\n \n\nThe only defender back was USC's point guard, Gabe Pruitt. Nick Young? He wasn't coming—dude was still recovering from Chen's earlier highlight reel.\n\n \n\nJust past the three-point line, Chen suddenly stopped on a dime, flicked the ball behind his back—whoop!\n\n \n\nGabe Pruitt flew three meters in the wrong direction!\n\n \n\n\"Pull that shit!\" Durant shouted from behind, grinning. They had a big lead now, so it didn't matter if Chen missed a heat-check three.\n\n \n\nBut Chen had already made up his mind. Even if KD hadn't said anything, he was pulling it.\n\n \n\nHis three-point rating wasn't elite—just a [73]—but he was wide open. And this wasn't NCAA range; he was a step outside, which just so happened to be NBA range.\n\n \n\nChen caught the ball clean, planted, rose up, and snapped his wrist—\n\n \n\nSwish!\n\n \n\nThe ball cut through the air and dropped through the net, barely touching the rim. A perfect arc. The crowd exploded.\n\n \n\n\"Wet! Chen just dropped a cold-blooded three off the shake! That boy's straight-up hoopin' tonight!\"\n\n \n\n\"Look at that grin—he's having the time of his life out there!\"\n\n \n\nWith 2:01 left in the second half, Nick Young finally had a little moment to shine.\n\n \n\nAfter two slick behind-the-back dribbles, he shifted to the baseline and spun into a clean fadeaway jumper. Splash!\n\n \n\nIt was smooth. Stylish. Cold.\n\n \n\nBut... meaningless.\n\n \n\nUSC was still down 27 points.\n\n \n\nTexas fans in the stands were already munching on popcorn and chatting about who they'd face in the next round.\n\n \n\nStill, Nick Young wasn't letting the scoreboard kill his vibe. He stared into the camera, full of swagger, and yelled:\n\n \n\n\"Nobody can guard me!\"\n\n 2\n\nDurant and Chen Yan, already chilling on the bench, couldn't help but burst out laughing.\n\n \n\n\"Yo,\" Durant nudged Chen, \"he's wild for that. We're up almost thirty and he still tryna flex.\"\n\n \n\nChen grinned. \"That man plays happy basketball, huh?\"\n\n \n\nFinal Score: 77–50.\n\n \n\nUniversity of Texas stomps USC.\n\n \n\nNo one saw that kind of blowout coming—not even the most optimistic Longhorn fans.\n\n \n\nChen Yan played 28 minutes, shooting a blazing 14-of-18 from the field, including 1-of-1 from deep and 4-of-6 from the line. Final tally: 33 points.\n\n \n\nAnd it wasn't just the numbers—Chen had the crowd going crazy all night with those flashy plays. Easy top-10 material for March Madness highlights.\n\n \n\nDurant finished with 29 points and 7 rebounds, the second-highest scorer. Together, the two of them dropped 62 of Texas' 77 points. Absolutely unreal.\n\n \n\nOutside of those two, no one else even cracked double digits. DJ Augustin's 6 points came in as the third-highest total.\n\n \n\nAs the buzzer sounded, DJ threw his arms around Chen and Durant. Laughing, he shouted into the broadcast camera:\n\n \n\n\"The three of us? Unstoppable!\"\n\n 3\n\nIt was a night to remember.\n\n \n\nChen Yan had arrived—and the NCAA just got a brand-new problem.\n\n \n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\n \n\nCheck my Pâtreon for (40) advanced chapters\n\n \n\nPâtreon .com/Fanficlord03\n\n \n\nChange (â) to (a)\n\n \nCOMMENT\n5 comment\n \nVote\n1 left",

            "content": "Chapter 24: Why Watch the Top Five Plays? Just Watch His Highlights!\n\n \n\nFedEx Arena, Memphis — NCAA Elite Eight\n\n \n\nHalftime came to an end.\n\n \n\nThe Texas Longhorns were up by 11, leading Georgetown 51 to 40.\n\n \n\nDespite that brief scuffle earlier on the court, Chen Yan didn't let it mess with his rhythm.\n\n \n\nUp on the jumbo screen in FedEx Arena, his halftime stats were flashed for the entire crowd to see:\n\n \n\n9 of 14 shooting, 0 for 1 from deep, 2 of 3 at the line — 20 points at halftime.\n\n \n\nSure, it wasn't as wild as the last game, but compared to everyone else on the floor, it was still straight-up monstrous. Especially considering Georgetown had put their entire game plan into locking him down.\n\n \n\nVan Gundy, up in the analyst's box, let out a soft sigh.\n\n \n\n\"You can't really shut down a guy like him. Best you can do is try to throw him off rhythm, slow him down from heating up too early.\"\n\n \n\nIn the VIP box above, Jerry West cracked a satisfied smile.\n\n \n\nHe'd been watching the entire first half in silence, eyes locked on Chen Yan.\n\n \n\nThis was how West scouted talent—quietly and precisely. If word got out that he was looking at Chen Yan? Yeah, half the league would start drooling over the kid.\n\n \n\nAnd that was the last thing he needed.\n\n \n\nEven now, plenty of teams were already circling like sharks.\n\n \n\nBack in the Longhorns' locker room, the vibe was loose. Confident. Controlled.\n\n \n\nUp double digits? Check. Chen Yan and Durant clicking like fire? Check. March Madness magic still flowing? Oh yeah.\n\n \n\nThey'd been rolling like this since Round 1.\n\n \n\nOver in the Georgetown locker room, though, it wasn't total despair.\n\n \n\nDown 11 wasn't the end of the world. Their message was simple—stay united, push harder, chip away.\n\n \n\nEven Ewing's ejection? Honestly? Not a huge deal.\n\n \n\nTexas had never made it past the Final Four.\n\n \n\nOnly three times in school history had they even reached the semis—1943, 1947, and 2003.\n\n \n\nGeorgetown? They hadn't touched the Final Four in 23 years.\n\n \n\nBoth squads were starving for the dub.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nSecond Half — Tip-Off\n\n \n\nThe whistle blew. DJ Augustin came out aggressive, driving hard—but Hibbert stuffed him at the rim.\n\n \n\nTo be fair, DJ's read wasn't bad. Chen Yan and Durant had cleared the floor, spacing things out. But Hibbert was a certified wall under the basket.\n\n \n\nGeorgetown flipped the switch and countered on the break.\n\n \n\nWith numbers up front, Jeremiah Rivers—yeah, Doc Rivers' oldest son—got an easy layup off the glass.\n\n \n\nScore gap: now single digits.\n\n \n\nGeorgetown fans erupted.\n\n \n\nTexas answered fast.\n\n \n\nDJ Augustin played it cool, bringing it upcourt before handing it off to Durant.\n\n \n\nKD caught it on the wing, faked a hand-off to Chen Yan.\n\n \n\nAt that instant, Chen Yan exploded off-ball like a damn rocket—drawing two defenders.\n\n \n\nKD saw the space, dribbled once to the side and let it fly.\n\n \n\n\"Swish!\"\n\n \n\nHigh arc. Straight net.\n\n \n\nDurant didn't even watch it go in—he already knew. He turned and gave Chen Yan a firm smack on the backside.\n\n \n\n\"Let's go, baby!\"\n\n \n\nPlaying with Chen Yan on the court felt like night and day for KD.\n\n 2\n\nTruth be told, he was getting lowkey addicted to the guy's presence.\n\n 1\n\nJust like the first half, Durant was the primary scorer again, while Chen Yan played the role of tactical hub—pulling gravity, creating chaos, letting KD cook.\n\n \n\nGeorgetown wasn't going down without swinging, though.\n\n \n\nHibbert took the brunt of the load, demanding the rock in the post every trip.\n\n \n\nTexas stuck with the half-circle scheme, rotating Pittman and Damian James to lean on him.\n\n \n\nOnce Hibbert got it deep in the paint, it was damn near impossible to stop him. But Texas never let him get comfortable. Even when he caught it, it was always through contact, always draining energy.\n\n \n\nBarely 4.5 minutes into the half, Hibbert already looked gassed.\n\n \n\nScore sat at 60–50. Georgetown was hanging by a thread thanks to Hibbert's inside buckets.\n\n \n\nTexas Ball\n\n \n\nDurant took the rock near the arc, crossed over and glided into the lane.\n\n \n\nJust outside the restricted area, he floated one up—soft touch.\n\n \n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n \n\nBall kissed the rim and popped high into the air.\n\n \n\n\"Rebound!\" Georgetown's coach roared from the sidelines.\n\n \n\nHibbert spun around to crash the glass—\n\n \n\nBut it was already too late.\n\n \n\nBOOM!!\n\n \n\nChen Yan came flying in like a damn missile, snatching the ball mid-air and slamming it down with both hands!\n\n 2\n\nTip-in dunk!\n\n \n\nBehind Hibbert's back—posterized!\n\n \n\nThe arena erupted. The Texas fans lost their minds, jumping out of their seats!\n\n \n\nChen Yan had torched the crowd's senses again—this time with a putback jam that had the rim shaking.\n\n \n\nHe landed, fists clenched, and roared from the baseline.\n\n \n\nFirst time he'd ever done that in-game. And it felt damn good.\n\n \n\nHibbert just shook his head. The speed—too much. He didn't even see Chen Yan coming.\n\n \n\nBut he couldn't be blamed. Rebounding had always been Hibbert's weak spot.\n\n 1\n\nHe was their shot blocker, not a rebound vacuum. His size hurt his lateral quickness. And once he left the paint? Forget second jumps—those boards were up for grabs.\n\n \n\n\"Man, that was almost a straight-up dunk!\" Durant hollered as he ran back.\n\n \n\nChen Yan grinned.\n\n \n\n\"Side dunks don't hit the same. I want it head-on next time.\"\n\n \n\nThe game pushed on.\n\n \n\nGeorgetown fed Hibbert again.\n\n \n\nHe muscled in and drew a foul. Two shots at the stripe.\n\n \n\nHit the first.\n\n \n\nJust as the buzzer sounded—Georgetown made a sub.\n\n \n\nJeff Green checked in.\n\n \n\nThe guy had played all 20 minutes in the first half. Coach John Thompson III originally wanted to give him more rest, but with Hibbert sucking wind, he had no choice but to throw Green back in early.\n\n \n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n \n\nHibbert clanked the second free throw, and the ball bounced hard off the rim.\n\n \n\nDurant snagged the rebound, his eyes immediately scanning the court—looking for him.\n\n \n\nThe moment there was even a sliver of a fast break opportunity, there was only one name on the Texas team's mind: Chen Yan.\n\n \n\nSpotting his teammate streaking down the sideline, Durant fired a crisp outlet pass. Chen caught it in stride and immediately turned up the jets.\n\n \n\nJeff Green tried to keep up, but he wasn't built for speed—and having just checked in, his legs weren't even warm. Within seconds, Chen Yan blew by him with a nasty burst of acceleration.\n\n \n\nZoom! Chen streaked down the sideline like a bullet, then cut hard at a 45-degree angle just beyond the arc.\n\n \n\nHe didn't slow down for even a second—just swerved into the lane, gliding through traffic with otherworldly control.\n\n \n\nNow it was two-on-one.\n\n \n\nVernon McLean and Jonathan Wallace closed in to wall off the paint.\n\n \n\nBut Chen Yan didn't care.\n\n \n\nHe lunged forward, stretched his body midair, and yanked the ball wide between the defenders in a huge, sweeping pull!\n\n \n\n\"Ahhh!!\" Chen let out a shout as he got bumped and lost balance.\n\n \n\n\"Beep!\"\n\n \n\nThe whistle blew as the ball dropped through the net.\n\n \n\nAnd-one!\n\n \n\nDurant and Damian James sprinted up from the backcourt, pulling Chen up from the hardwood.\n\n \n\n\"Yo! That was crazy! That fast break was straight art!\"\n\n \n\n\"Man, Chen's got that freaky combo—speed, ball control, touch—everything!\"\n\n \n\nMike Breen and Van Gundy couldn't hide the hype.\n\n \n\n\"Chen might look skinny,\" Van Gundy said, \"but don't let that fool you—his core strength is elite. Even off-balance, his shot doesn't break down.\"\n\n \n\nChen calmly stepped to the free throw line.\n\n \n\nSwish.\n\n \n\n65–51.\n\n \n\nBefore Texas could settle, Georgetown had already inbounded. No time to breathe.\n\n \n\nJeff Green used an off-ball screen to shake loose in the corner—cash from midrange.\n\n \n\n\"Swish!\"\n\n \n\nBut even before the ball hit the floor, Chen Yan had his hand out, calling for it again.\n\n \n\nHe was locked in now—fully activated.\n\n \n\nDamian James grabbed the ball at the baseline and launched a bullet pass downcourt. Chen caught it clean and exploded forward.\n\n \n\nGeorgetown wasn't even back on defense yet.\n\n \n\nWith a long stride and slick hesitation, Chen froze Hibbert at the top of the arc—then crossed right past him.\n\n \n\nHibbert had stayed back the last possession to anchor the paint, but it didn't matter.\n\n \n\nChen Yan zoomed right by, full throttle.\n\n \n\nBoom!\n\n \n\nOne-handed dunk. Loud and vicious.\n\n \n\n67–53.\n\n \n\nOn the sideline, NBA legends Allen Iverson and Alonzo Mourning looked at each other and just shook their heads.\n\n \n\nDamn.\n\n \n\nChen Yan had turned Georgetown's paint into his personal playground. In and out like he had a key.\n\n \n\nFans in the FedEx Forum jumped to their feet, shouting and cheering. This was the kind of play that made highlight reels. One-stop offense. Straight-up streetball energy.\n\n \n\nGeorgetown rushed it again from the baseline.\n\n \n\nThey were losing grip, caught in the chaos of Texas' tempo.\n\n \n\nHibbert barely made it to the three-point line before Jeff Green swung the ball to Rivers at the 45.\n\n \n\nPull-up three—got it.\n\n \n\n67–56.\n\n \n\n\"The tempo's wild now,\" Van Gundy said. \"It's turning into a track meet.\"\n\n \n\n\"And Chen's just cooking,\" Breen added. \"Georgetown's lost in Texas' rhythm. With Hibbert, they should've slowed it down and played in the half court.\"\n\n \n\nToo late.\n\n \n\nTexas was already blitzing again.\n\n \n\nDJ Augustin flew past halfcourt and zipped a pass to Chen. The crowd held their breath—he had it again.\n\n \n\nBut this time? No isolation.\n\n \n\nChen faked the drive, then slipped a sneaky bounce pass to Pittman under the rim.\n\n \n\nWide open.\n\n \n\nToo easy—wait.\n\n \n\nPittman fumbled it. Blew the open layup!\n\n \n\nCoach Rick Barnes clutched his chest on the sideline like he'd just taken a punch.\n\n \n\nBefore Pittman could recover, Hibbert came flying in to contest.\n\n \n\nPittman panicked and passed it out—bad move.\n\n \n\nJeff Green, lying in wait, read the pass and stretched out like a spider.\n\n \n\nSteal!\n\n \n\nHe took off in the other direction, but!\n\n \n\nSnap!\n\n \n\nChen Yan intercepted it right back in midair!\n\n \n\nCounter-steal!\n\n \n\nEverything turned to chaos.\n\n \n\nOffensive sets? Gone. Defensive rotations? Gone.\n\n \n\nNone of that mattered to Chen Yan.\n\n \n\nHe had the ball, he had momentum—and he had only one target: the rim.\n\n \n\nTwo steps. Launch.\n\n \n\nHibbert barely turned around when Chen Yan took off.\n\n \n\nDude had heavy legs from sprinting back and forth all game. All he could do was throw his hands up to protect his face.\n\n \n\nBOOM!!!!\n\n \n\nFront dunk. On his head.\n\n \n\nAbsolute brutality.\n\n \n\nBy the time Hibbert realized what had happened, Chen Yan was literally on his shoulders.\n\n \n\nThe whole arena erupted like a bomb had gone off!\n\n 2\n\n\"OOOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!!\"\n\n \n\nTexas' bench exploded. Players tackled each other, falling over like bowling pins.\n\n \n\nIf they weren't pulling each other back, half the squad would've stormed the court.\n\n \n\n\"Timeout! Timeout!

            "content": "Chapter 37: The NCAA Finals Are Coming!\n\nThe NCAA finals sold out in less than thirty minutes after the official announcement.\n\nAnd this wasn't just any small-time venue—this was Lucas Oil Stadium, renovated to seat 75,000 fans. Over 70,000 tickets, gone in half an hour. That's a new NCAA record.\n\nA huge reason? Chen Yan.\n\nFrom the madness of March all the way to the Final Four, Chen Yan had been crowned with nickname after nickname:\n\n\"Allen Iverson Plus,\"\n\nand even—according to some tabloids—\"Taylor Swift's rumored boyfriend.\"\n\nAdd in his electric playstyle, insane highlights, and mysterious off-court image—he had zero presence on social media—and the hype around him exploded nationwide.\n\nEveryone wanted to see what this kid would do next.\n\nEven NBA players were getting in on the action, placing bets in their locker rooms on who would take the title.\n\nMarch Madness had reached its final crescendo—the championship game. And this year's finale? One of the most anticipated in NCAA history.\n\nThe day before the finals.\n\nChen Yan picked up the phone and made a special call home.\n\nHe wasn't the only one. The Texas Longhorns players were all calling family. Hearing a familiar voice helped calm the nerves before the biggest game of their lives.\n\nChen's parents told him something unexpected: the NCAA Finals were going to be broadcast in China—just one day later.\n\nIt felt surreal. Chen Yan had never imagined that an entire nation might sit down in front of their TVs to watch him play basketball.\n\nAnd honestly, neither had his parents.\n\nThey always thought Chen just played ball in college for fun. Now? He was about to be shown on CCTV. National broadcast. It felt like a dream.\n\nAnd as Chen Yan's name spread, his parents' lives changed too.\n\nReporters kept showing up at their doorstep, looking for scoops or juicy stories. His dad, who ran a sporting goods store, had customers crowding in—not to buy, but to ask about Chen Yan. Some didn't even shop. They just took selfies at the storefront and left like it was a tourist site.\n\nHis mom, a middle school teacher, noticed something strange—her class suddenly got way more attentive. Especially the rowdy boys in the back.\n\nTurns out, they weren't suddenly passionate about academics.\n\nThey just wanted their teacher to ask Chen Yan for an autograph.\n\nThat's next-level fan dedication.\n\nDespite the occasional hassle, Chen Yan's parents weren't bothered. In fact, they were proud.\n\nTheir son was becoming someone the whole world was watching.\n\n\"Son, don't stress. Stay humble, stay focused, and play like you do in practice. No matter what happens, you're our pride.\"\n\nThat was his father's last piece of advice before hanging up.\n\n...And then, the same father went right back to clipping out articles and bragging to every relative and neighbor.\n\n\"Hey, my son's on TV tomorrow. Don't miss it!\"\n\nAfter days of build-up, showtime finally arrived.\n\nApril 9th. Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\nOn this day, even the NBA cleared its schedule. Officially, it was to \"give way\" to the college game. Truthfully? No one was watching NBA games tonight anyway.\n\nThe whole country's eyes were on this court.\n\nBoth teams hit the floor for light practice, mostly just to get familiar with the environment.\n\nBasketball wasn't an exam—you couldn't cram last-minute. Overtraining would just mess with your rhythm.\n\nThe Texas squad was still loose in the morning.\n\nBut by the time they returned to the stadium in the afternoon, the tension was real. Faces were tight. Focused.\n\nThey were all young, none of them had been on a stage this big. The nerves? Totally normal.\n\nOhio State was probably going through the same thing.\n\nDuring warmups, Chen Yan did his usual media rounds and sat down with ESPN.\n\n\"Chen, tonight you're stepping onto the NCAA Finals court. Any special feelings?\"\n\nChen smiled. \"I'm hyped. This is a legendary arena. I'll be playing in front of 75,000 people tonight. If I can lift that championship trophy by the end of the night? I'll be even more hyped.\"\n\n\"You sound confident. But let's talk about your opponents—Ohio State hasn't lost since January 9. That's 22 wins in a row. Do you think that streak puts extra pressure on your team?\"\n\nChen shrugged and grinned. \"A lot of teams say they've never lost—until they play us.\"\n\nHe paused, then added,\n\n\"We're gonna end that streak. Because there's only one champion.\"\n\nThat was Chen Yan for you—never fake modesty. He played loud, talked bold, and always backed it up.\n\nTonight at Lucas Oil Stadium, there was only one mission:\n\nWin the chip. Win the chip. Win the damn chip.\n\nIn the Texas locker room.\n\nEveryone was waiting on the opening ceremony.\n\nTonight's delay felt especially long. The NCAA had thrown in a whole production—live music, dancers, acrobats, spoken word poetry—you name it.\n\nJust typical American flair, turning the game into a spectacle.\n\nBefore they headed down the tunnel, Coach Rick Barnes gathered the team for one final huddle.\n\n\"Boys, we've made it this far together. Now, the last step is right in front of us.\"\n\n\"Let's go take it! Let's make history tonight—and put every single one of your names in the Texas Longhorns Hall of Fame forever!\"\n\n\"I don't need to say more. You know what this means. Go out there and enjoy the final stage!\"\n\nThe locker room exploded.\n\n\"ONE! TWO! THREE! TEXAS LONGHORNS!\"\n\n\"ONE! TWO! THREE! TEXAS LONGHORNS!\"\n\n\"ONE! TWO! THREE! TEXAS LONGHORNS!\"\n\nThen the whole squad stormed out with fire in their eyes.\n\nKevin Durant led the charge.\n\nChen Yan followed last—reserved for the team's biggest star.\n\nWithout Chen, this team wouldn't even be on this stage.\n\nThe entrance ceremony was on another level.\n\nThe lights dimmed, beams of white and red slicing across the darkened arena. The DJ's voice blasted over the sound system, calling out the players' names like it was WrestleMania.\n\nChen Yan stood in the tunnel, soaking it all in.\n\nHe stared out into a sea of fans, jam-packed to the rafters. T-shirts, signs, face paint, musical instruments—this crowd came ready to make noise.\n\nStars from all over the entertainment and sports world filled the VIP seats.\n\nChen had gotten used to the celebrity attention over the past month, but this? This was still something else.\n\n\"And now… starting at point guard… from the University of Texas...\n\nCHEN~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ YAN!!!\"\n\nA spotlight beamed down on him.\n\nThe roar of the crowd was deafening.\n\nChen stepped out, head high, heart pounding, adrenaline surging.\n\nTime to write his name into college basketball history.\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nCheck my Pâtreon for (40) advanced chapters\n\nPâtreon .com/Fanficlord03\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nhttps://discord.gg/MntqcdpRZ9",

            "content": "Chapter 51: Durant's Trumpet, Big Deal!\n\nAs soon as the trade news broke, Paul Pierce lost it.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?!\" he shouted during an interview. \"I gave this team ten years of my life. Ten! If that doesn't count for something, I don't know what does.\"\n\nPierce was furious—and for good reason. Just last season, he'd played along with management's plan to tank. From opening night, he deliberately underperformed so the Celtics could land a top pick. The result? Boston ended up dead last in the East and won the Durant sweepstakes.\n\nAnd now that they got their guy?\n\nThey kicked him to the curb.\n\n\"What kind of operation is this?\" he ranted to reporters. \"It's like getting cheated on by your wife—and you're the one who bought the condoms for her and her side dude.\"\n\nGeneral Manager Danny Ainge didn't respond. The man was known for being cold-blooded, always making moves with one thing in mind: winning. Feelings didn't factor in.\n\nNow that Durant was in the picture, Ainge was ready to build around him—with Al Jefferson and Rajon Rondo flanking the rookie phenom. As for the Celtics' record this season? Ainge didn't care. His only directive was simple:\n\nWhether he missed 10 shots or 20, it didn't matter. Just keep feeding him the rock. The goal was clear—develop Durant, fast. And if the team landed another top-three pick in next year's draft? Even better.\n\nThe 2008 class was stacked: Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Michael Beasley, Kevin Love, Eric Gordon, Brook and Robin Lopez. Add any of them to the young core, and Boston's future would be lit.\n\nHe was no longer part of that future.\n\nHe went scorched earth in the media, torching not only Ainge but also Durant.\n\n\"New superstar? Don't make me laugh. Dude's skinny as hell. I heard he can't even bench press 185 pounds. Can't even lift the bar with plates!\"\n\nRule #1 in the NBA: don't come for a man's pride, especially not on national TV.\n\nPierce didn't just talk trash—he hit a nerve. The infamous bench press story had haunted Durant since draft night.\n\nAnd KD wasn't about to stay silent.\n\nInside his apartment, Durant clenched his fists, then walked into his bedroom, closed the door, and fired up his laptop.\n\nHe scrolled through the latest headlines and flipped to a burner Twitter account—one of many.\n\n\"Pierce is washed. The team needs change.\"\n\n\"He's holding the Celtics back. Old head can't move anymore.\"\n\n\"Paul Pierce talks a big game, but if he had half the skills he thinks he does, we wouldn't have finished last.\"\n\n\"Who cares about bench press? KD has a basketball, not a barbell. Give him the rock, he'll cook that fossil.\"\n\n\"KD is the future. In 10 years, y'all will say Ainge made the smartest move in franchise history.\"\n\nAfter a barrage of tweets, Durant leaned back in his chair, feeling satisfied. The burner had done its job.\n\nBut while Pierce was the angriest, Ray Allen might've been the most anxious.\n\nHe and Pierce had talked in the offseason—plans were in motion to join forces in Boston and chase a ring together. Now? Pierce was headed to Toronto, and Allen was stuck in Seattle, rethinking everything.\n\nHe was nearing the twilight of his career. If he wanted a shot at a championship, it had to be soon.\n\nThe SuperSonics weren't blind to this. They didn't block Ray's request to leave—but they made one thing clear:\n\nBring us something valuable in return.\n\nThe franchise had already let Rashard Lewis walk last year. If they also lost Ray Allen without a decent haul, the rebuild would be in shambles. What they needed now was talent—young, high-upside players and, most importantly, draft picks.\n\nOver the next two weeks, teams around the league came knocking, looking to make a deal for the sharpshooter.\n\nSeattle didn't bite immediately.\n\nThey played the waiting game—just like an auction. Best offer wins.\n\nFinally, on July 12, the SuperSonics and the Dallas Mavericks reached a preliminary deal.\n\nDevin Harris (promising young PG),\n\nBrandon Bass (strong, athletic forward),\n\ntwo first-round picks,\n\nand one second-rounder over the next two years.\n\nHarris and Bass were solid, but it was the draft picks that got Seattle excited. For a team rebuilding from the ground up, picks were like gold.\n\nEven better? Ray Allen was thrilled about the destination.\n\nThe Mavs had just finished the regular season with the best record in the West. Teaming up with Dirk Nowitzki gave him a legit shot at the title.\n\nMark Cuban couldn't contain himself.\n\nHe immediately posted on social media:\n\n\"Ray Allen! Welcome to Dallas—your new home!\"\n\nBut... he jumped the gun.\n\nSome parts of the deal were still being finalized. Realizing his mistake, Cuban deleted the post.\n\nFans had already screenshotted it. The news spread like wildfire. By sundown, everyone in the league knew: Ray Allen was headed to Dallas.\n\nChen Yan got the update not long after.\n\nWhen he saw the notification, he couldn't help but shake his head and laugh.\n\nRay Allen and Dirk Nowitzki on the same team?\n\nThat's a cheat code from beyond the arc.\n\nThey weren't just going to shoot threes—they were going to drill holes through the earth's crust.\n\nWith Pierce in Toronto and Ray Allen in Dallas, the legendary Celtics Big Three—Pierce, Allen, and Garnett—would never happen in this timeline.\n\nHistory had officially been rewritten.\n\nChen Yan got up, brushed his teeth, washed his face, and powered on his laptop to catch up on the latest NBA news.\n\n\"Breaking News! Lakers and Timberwolves Agree to Massive 7-Player Deal!\"\n\nSuddenly, he was wide awake.\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nCheck my Pâtreon for (40) advanced chapters\n\nPâtreon .com/Fanficlord03\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nhttps://discord.gg/MntqcdpRZ9",

Congratulations to the host for winning the game. You have been awarded 4 Honor Points!\n\nAs soon as Chen Yan stepped into the locker room shower, the system notification chimed in his mind.\n\nNine honor points.\n\nNot bad for a debut.\n\nCompared to college ball, scoring points in the NBA was clearly on another level.\n\nBut this was just the beginning. There were 82 regular-season games, and then came the playoffs... The grind was real.\n\nAfter his shower, Chen Yan walked out wrapped in nothing but a bath towel—only to be instantly swarmed by reporters.\n\nUnlike other leagues, NBA locker rooms were open to the media after games—a long-standing tradition.\n\nChen Yan clearly wasn't used to it yet.\n\nAs soon as he appeared, a few of his teammates burst out laughing.\n\n\"Yo! Rookie still thinkin' he in college!\" Stoudemire cracked up.\n\nChen Yan had played like a seasoned vet on the court, but off the court? He was still every bit the rookie.\n\nHe had a lot to learn.\n\nShrugging, Chen Yan sat down in front of his locker and tried to keep his composure. He could only play it cool, or the embarrassment would hit harder.\n\nReporter: \"Chen! First off, congrats on a perfect debut. What's the biggest difference between the NCAA and the NBA?\"\n\nChen: \"The biggest difference? Hmm... I've never been half-naked, wrapped in a towel, and interviewed by this many people after a game before.\"\n\nEveryone: Laughter erupts\n\nReporters cracked up. Chen's quick wit and relaxed attitude won them over immediately.\n\nNBA media loved players who could talk—not just play.\n\nReporter: \"30 points, 5 rebounds, 5 steals—that's one of the best rookie debuts we've seen. How'd you pull it off?\"\n\nChen: \"Because I've got a squad full of real ones. My teammates were unselfish and fed me the rock all night. They created space, set solid screens, and had my back every possession. Without them, tonight wouldn't have gone so smooth.\"\n\nHis answer hit all the right notes.\n\nThe guys around him smiled. Chen wasn't hogging the spotlight—he knew how to share the shine.\n\nDio even walked over and handed Chen a cappuccino, earning some chuckles from the cameras.\n\nChen didn't forget to shout out the coach either.\n\nChen: \"Coach D'Antoni's system gave me a lot of freedom on offense. He trusted me to go downhill and let me be aggressive. That's a big reason I found my rhythm early.\"\n\nReporter: \"Do you have a message for the Suns fans? They were on fire tonight—chanting your name as you left the court.\"\n\nChen: \"I just wanna say thank you. I know y'all have been waiting on my debut, and I promise—your patience will be worth it. This is just the beginning.\"\n\nReporter: \"Are you satisfied with tonight's performance?\"\n\nChen: \"This was my first NBA game. My goal was to feel the vibe, get a sense of the tempo out there.\"\n\nReporters: \"...???\"\n\nYou dropped 30+5+5 just to get a feel for the court?\n\nHe said it so humbly, but it was absolute flex.\n\nThen came a spicy one.\n\nRed-haired female reporter from Fox Sports: \"Chen! Has anyone told you your muscle definition is... perfect?\"\n\nShe leaned in with a mischievous grin, mic in hand, clearly unbothered by locker room etiquette.\n\nChen raised an eyebrow but stayed composed. He answered her just like he did everyone else—respectful, cool, professional.\n\nHe knew the game wasn't just on the court.\n\nHaving a good relationship with the media mattered. They voted for awards like MVP.\n\nEven Kobe's MVP campaign in 2005-06 might've gone differently if he'd been on better terms with reporters.\n\nIn the same locker room, reporters shifted their focus to other Suns players.\n\nGrant Hill, the veteran, spoke with class:\n\n\"I've seen a lot of rookies come through this league, but Chen? He's different. That was one of the most impressive debuts I've witnessed.\"\n\nStoudemire kept it blunt:\n\n\"Best debut I've ever seen—hands down. Better than Iverson's. And don't come at me with Wilt or Big O. That was a different era, man. Half those numbers were against part-time plumbers.\"\n\nHe wasn't wrong. The league had evolved, and dominance in the modern NBA carried a different weight.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Toyota Center in Houston...\n\nAfter finishing his own game, Tracy McGrady cracked open his laptop and scrolled through the night's headlines.\n\nT-Mac: \"Yao, isn't this Chen kid your little bro? He just went off.\"\n\nYao Ming: \"How many points?\"\n\nT-Mac: \"Thirty-one.\"\n\nYao blinked. He'd barely had time to catch up on the night's other games.\n\nYao: \"Thirty-one? In his debut?\"\n\nT-Mac: \"Yeah. 31 points, 5 boards, 5 steals. Rookie went nuclear.\"\n\nYao let out a low whistle.\n\n\"He's making headlines for sure.\"\n\nAt Staples Center, Los Angeles...\n\nThe Lakers had just torched the Bobcats in their season opener.\n\nKobe dropped 29 points and 7 assists—his new chemistry with Kevin Garnett already showing.\n\nDuring his post-game presser, a reporter asked:\n\nReporter: \"Chen Yan scored 31 points and had 5 steals tonight. Thoughts?\"\n\nKobe raised an eyebrow.\n\nKobe: \"Wait... 31 and 5? You serious?\"\n\nReporter: \"Yup. Fresh out the gate.\"\n\nKobe leaned back, grinning.\n\nKobe: \"You're asking a guy who dropped zero in his debut to comment on that?\"\n\nEveryone: Laughs\n\nIt was no secret Kobe went scoreless in his first NBA game. He was in a good mood after a win and didn't mind roasting himself a little.\n\nThen he turned serious.\n\nKobe: \"It's dope seeing young talent pop up. I watched some of his NCAA games—kid's legit. I'm looking forward to matching up with him.\"\n\nLater that night, Chen finally left the arena and slid into his Ferrari 458.\n\nHe was about to head home when—\n\nGridlock.\n\nBut it wasn't traffic—it was fans. Dozens of them packed around the exit, chanting his name.\n\nHe rolled the window down, gave a few waves, flashed a smile.\n\nBut he didn't stop for photos or autographs.\n\nIt wasn't that he didn't want to.\n\nHe just knew—\n\nIf he stopped now, he might never get the engine started again.\n\n[TL: I didn't expect our power stones for this week break past 100, thank you guys, this type of support from you guys motivate me most, so i'll expect more hahahaha ]\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nCheck my Pâtreon for Advanced Chapters\n\nPâtreon .com/Fanficlord03\n\nChange (â) to (a)\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nhttps://discord.gg/MntqcdpRZ9",

            "content": "Chapter 81: Kobe Enters and a Wave of Explosions!\n\n \n\nAfter using the [Status Upgrade Card], Chen Yan could immediately feel the changes surging through his body.\n\n \n\nHis muscles weren't as tight as before, his mind felt sharper, and even the fatigue seemed to melt away.\n\n \n\nPhysically, he felt better than he had in any of the previous games. But he'd only know for sure once he hit the court.\n\n \n\nThe 15-minute halftime break flew by.\n\n \n\nSecond half — game on.\n\n \n\nThe Phoenix Suns kept their starting five: Nash, Chen Yan, Raja Bell, Boris Diaw, and Amare Stoudemire.\n\n \n\nThe Lakers made a slight adjustment, subbing out Luke Walton for sniper Vladimir Radmanović to stretch the floor.\n\n \n\nThe Suns got first possession.\n\n \n\nNash brought the ball up past halfcourt, and Chen Yan stepped up to set a screen for him. Having wasted a few scoring opportunities in the first half, Chen wasn't looking to go iso or force his own shot right away. Instead, he took the initiative to create space and open looks for his teammates.\n\n \n\nThis time, his screen was solid—he completely wiped Fisher out.\n\n \n\nNash used the pick, changed direction, and slipped right past the veteran point guard. But just as he turned the corner to attack the paint...\n\n \n\nKobe.\n\n \n\nHe slid around Chen's screen and jumped right into Nash's path.\n\n \n\nKobe clearly saw Nash as the bigger threat. The guy was a three-time assist king, a member of the exclusive 50–40–90 club, and could torch you in multiple ways.\n\n \n\nNash didn't force it. He shuffled sideways, read the double, and kicked it back to Chen Yan.\n\n \n\nMismatch.\n\n \n\nStanding in front of Chen was Fisher—shorter, older, and clearly slower.\n\n \n\nFisher bent his knees, pulled up his shorts, and gave Chen that classic pitbull glare.\n\n \n\n\"Let's see what you've got, rookie.\"\n\n \n\nChen Yan didn't hesitate. He exploded to the right, one dribble, one step—gone.\n\n \n\nIn the paint, Kwame Brown rotated over to help, but Chen soared, twisted in mid-air, and pulled off a gorgeous reverse layup through contact.\n\n \n\nAnd-one!\n\n \n\nFisher turned around in disbelief.\n\n \n\n\"Damn... he's for real.\"\n\n \n\n\"Wow! Chen just bullied Fisher off the dribble, drew the foul, and still got it to drop!\"\n\n \n\n\"Fisher's speed out there... man, it's like he's dragging an anchor.\"\n\n \n\n\"Haha, c'mon now. Comparing Fisher's speed to Chen's is just cruel.\"\n\n \n\nThe TNT crew couldn't help but crack jokes as Chen calmly stepped up and knocked down the free throw.\n\n \n\n54–59.\n\n \n\nLakers inbounded quickly.\n\n \n\nFisher pushed the ball up and handed it off to Kobe, who set up the offense at the top of the key.\n\n \n\nThis time, Kobe and Garnett ran a high pick-and-roll. Using Garnett's massive frame, Kobe accelerated into the paint, slicing through the defense and finishing with a smooth reverse layup.\n\n \n\n54–61.\n\n \n\nBack in the day, teams used to double Kobe immediately on those screens and live with the big man getting open. But not anymore. Not with Kevin Garnett as the screener. You don't leave an All-Star like that unguarded—no team would.\n\n \n\nSuns wasted no time.\n\n \n\nNash flew up the court and swung it to Diaw at the elbow. For a moment, Diaw considered attacking Kwame Brown one-on-one.\n\n \n\nBut this version of Diaw didn't have the strength or footwork yet. After a couple of clumsy dribbles, he realized Brown wasn't budging.\n\n \n\nAwkward.\n\n \n\nSo he turned and flipped a one-handed pass to Chen Yan in the corner.\n\n \n\nChen caught it, then slid up to the left wing. Raja Bell stepped in to screen for him, cupping his hands over his crotch and bracing for impact.\n\n \n\nKobe, anticipating the screen, started to go over it early—but Chen had other plans.\n\n \n\nHe dropped his center of gravity and snapped in the opposite direction.\n\n \n\nKobe tried to recover, but Chen's first step was too fast—lightning quick. He gained a step, then blew by completely, curling baseline.\n\n \n\nHere comes Kwame again.\n\n \n\nChen hesitated—then hit him with a sudden spin move and a lefty layup off the glass!\n\n \n\n56–61.\n\n \n\nKwame staggered back, dazed by the change of pace.\n\n \n\nHe looked around like he needed GPS help.\n\n \n\nFrom the Suns bench, the subs erupted—waving towels, yelling, clapping.\n\n \n\nIt wasn't just the move—it was the vibe.\n\n \n\nChen was back.\n\n \n\nLakers' possession.\n\n \n\nThis time, they posted up Garnett on the low block. Kobe stationed himself at the elbow, keeping the Suns from sending help.\n\n \n\nWith two elite scorers spacing the floor like this, Phoenix had no choice but to play it straight up.\n\n \n\nAfter Garnett's strong post-up, he hit his signature turnaround, iron-blooded jumper.\n\n \n\n\"Swish!\"\n\n \n\n56–63.\n\n \n\nStoudemire timed his jump perfectly and got a hand up right in Garnett's face, but it still wasn't enough to stop the Big Ticket from knocking it down.\n\n \n\nThe Suns wasted no time inbounding the ball. Stoudemire hit Nash on the baseline, and Phoenix kicked into high gear.\n\n \n\nChen Yan sprinted up the court alongside Kobe, keeping pace in transition. The Suns' offensive rhythm was lightning-fast. Just a step outside the three-point arc, Chen caught a pass from Nash on the run.\n\n \n\nHe took one dribble, slid the ball between his legs, then gave a slick shoulder fake into a behind-the-back move—smooth as silk, all in one motion.\n\n \n\nKobe slid with him, eyes locked in, but Chen wasn't backing down. Despite his rough first half, he attacked without hesitation.\n\n \n\nThen—he rose.\n\n \n\nKobe contested, but Chen Yan was already in perfect rhythm.\n\n \n\n\"Swish!\"\n\n \n\n'The heavenly soldiers shone on the snowy frontier, raining golden armor like sand through the wind.'\n\n \n\nA poetic metaphor for a deadly shot—Chen's three-pointer was cold-blooded.\n\n \n\nHis edge, his fire—it was back.\n\n \n\n\"Damn! That was nasty!\"\n\n \n\n\"That shake was disgusting—dude just hit a dry pull right in Kobe's face!\"\n\n \n\n\"Yo, Kobe looked helpless. That kinda pull-up's impossible to stop!\"\n\n \n\n\"That's eight straight for Chen! He's heating up!\"\n\n \n\nThe Chinese fans were losing their minds. Chen had officially flipped the switch—from brick mode to bucket mode.\n\n \n\nBack on the other end, the Lakers ran their triangle offense.\n\n \n\nKobe slid into the low post, drawing a double-team immediately. Calm and composed, he kicked it out to Fisher, who was wide open.\n\n \n\nBut instead of shooting, Fisher swung it to Radmanovic in the corner.\n\n \n\nRadmanovic—L.A.'s king of long twos. A legit 6'10\" sniper, he loved those awkward mid-range looks just a foot inside the arc. His two-point and three-point percentages? Nearly identical. Steady shooter, no doubt.\n\n \n\nBut rational decision-making? Not really his thing.\n\n \n\nSoft like Charmin and stubborn to a fault, Vlad loved doing his own thing. And this time? He tried to get flashy.\n\n \n\nCaught the pass. Pump-faked. Then hit a slow crossover, trying to sauce Chen Yan.\n\n \n\nBad move.\n\n \n\n\"Snap!\"\n\n \n\nThe ball stayed, his body moved. Chen picked his pocket clean.\n\n \n\nRadmanovic's dribble was weak, his handle loose, and his center of gravity was all over the place—perfect target for a two-way hound like Chen.\n\n \n\nChen took off with the rock.\n\n \n\nKobe and Fisher instantly turned and sprinted back. Transition defense activated.\n\n \n\nChen reached half court, then spotted Nash diagonally ahead and zipped him the ball.\n\n \n\nWithout slowing down, Chen accelerated toward the rim.\n\n \n\nNash read the angle perfectly, floated the lob high into the air.\n\n \n\nKobe launched himself, trying to swat it out of the sky.\n\n \n\nToo late.\n\n \n\nThe lob arced just past his fingertips—\n\n \n\n\"BOOM!\"\n\n \n\nA thunderous slam!\n\n \n\nKobe crashed into Chen midair and was knocked flat by the sheer force.\n\n \n\nOn the broadcast, the replay showed Chen cocking it back and yamming it down with one arm, right over Kobe's outstretched frame.\n\n 1\n\nThe home crowd went silent.\n\n \n\nPhil Jackson didn't wait.\n\n \n\nTimeout, Lakers.\n\n \n\nChen landed, chest heaving, arms raised. He turned to the baseline cameras and roared.\n\n 2\n\nHe was back. Fully back.\n\n \n\n\"Yo!! My guy is flexin' now?\" Kenny Smith laughed.\n\n \n\n\"Man, what a run! Chen Yan's already got 10 in the second half!\" Reggie Miller said, amazed.\n\n \n\n\"Chen's screaming into the camera! This dude's not usually this fired up.\" Barkley chimed in.\n\n \n\n\"He's gotta let it out, Chuck! That first half had him locked up,\" Kenny added with a grin.\n\n \n\nAs the timeout buzzer echoed through the arena, Kobe, visibly fuming, slammed the basketball with one hand and stomped toward the bench.\n\n \n\nHe couldn't wrap his head around it—how Chen Yan, cold as ice in the first half, suddenly turned into a flamethrower.\n\n \n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\n \n\nCheck my Pâtreon for Advanced Chapters\n\n \n\nPâtreon .com/Fanficlord03\n\n \n\nChange (â) to (a)\n\n \n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\n \n\nhttps://discord.gg/MntqcdpRZ9\n\n \nCOMMENT\n1 comment\n \nVote\n1 left",

            "content": "Chapter 96: Confrontation! Taylor Swift and Her Bestie!\n\n \n\n\"Hey! Looks like Chen Yan might be dropping 50 again tonight!\" Zhang Weiping couldn't hide his excitement during the halftime break as he glanced over Chen Yan's stats.\n\n \n\nHonestly, he was tempted to say 60, but to avoid jinxing it—or getting slapped in the face by reality—he kept it conservative.\n\n \n\n\"The pace tonight is wild. Both teams are putting up numbers,\" Coach Xu chimed in. \"The Wizards have completely fallen into Phoenix's rhythm.\"\n\n \n\n\"Exactly,\" added Zhang Heli. \"This is classic Suns basketball: drag the opponent into their up-tempo, run-and-gun style… and then kill 'em with familiarity.\"\n\n \n\nBut on the other bench, Gilbert Arenas didn't think they were getting played. In his eyes, this was intentional. His idea was simple: beat speed with more speed. The only way to beat the Suns' pace? Outpace them.\n\n \n\nSo coming out of the half, the Wizards had a new plan for Chen Yan—foul him. Hard. Relentlessly.\n\n \n\n\"If he's gonna score,\" their huddle decided, \"make him earn it at the line.\"\n\n \n\nBut Chen Yan didn't blink. He calmly knocked down 7 of his first 8 free throws, looking smooth and locked in. Caron Butler caught three fouls trying to slow him down. With their hands tied, Washington had to scrap the plan.\n\n \n\nFine. Screw it. Let's just play straight-up and see who comes out on top.\n\n \n\nWithout Raja Bell in the lineup, the Suns' perimeter defense wasn't what it used to be. Nash couldn't contain Arenas, and Coach D'Antoni tried putting Hill and Chen Yan on the Wizards' star—no dice.\n\n \n\nHill's legs just weren't there anymore. He wasn't the fearless slasher who once wore the crown of \"Next Jordan.\" Arenas blew by him with ease.\n\n \n\nChen Yan had the foot speed to hang, but the strength and defensive fundamentals? Yeah, those were still a work in progress.\n\n \n\nIf Nash was a straight-up ATM on defense, Chen Yan was more like a half-busted vending machine. Serviceable, but unreliable. Both of them were offensive weapons first—and that was showing.\n\n \n\nD'Antoni was left with no choice. He sent Matt Barnes in to try and slow Gilbert down. And while Azubuike had promise on that end, the coach didn't trust him enough yet to throw him into that fire.\n\n \n\nBy the end of the third quarter, Arenas had racked up 43 points. Just 7 short of his personal goal.\n\n \n\nThe problem? The Suns were scoring just as easily. This wasn't defense anymore. It was a shootout.\n\n \n\nAfter three quarters, the Suns led the Wizards 91–78. Chen Yan had dropped 11 points in the third, mostly from the line. He spent that quarter drawing attention, taking hits, and setting up teammates.\n\n \n\nAnd it worked.\n\n \n\nThe Suns were clicking. Shots were falling from all over. Multi-point contributions usually meant one thing for Phoenix—wins.\n\n \n\nWith a 13-point lead heading into the fourth, most fans figured they were about to cruise to another W.\n\n \n\nBut then came the twist.\n\n \n\nWashington's Big Three—Arenas, Caron Butler, and Antawn Jamison—decided not to sit.\n\n \n\nInstead, they came out blazing.\n\n \n\nBoom. A 10–2 run right out the gate.\n\n \n\nArenas picked off a lazy pass and found Butler for a fast-break slam.\n\n \n\nNext play, Arenas kicked to Jamison for a wing triple. Then hit Stevenson for another one.\n\n \n\nIt was a statement: We're not done yet.\n\n \n\nGilbert had torched the floor in the first three quarters, but he knew he was running low on gas. So, he switched gears—playmaker mode activated. He stopped hunting for shots and started feeding the fire around him.\n\n \n\nAnd it worked. Jamison and Butler were no slouches. They were certified scorers.\n\n \n\nD'Antoni saw the storm coming and called timeout. The Suns' starters were coming back in. This was it. Final act.\n\n \n\nBoth teams stepped back on the court like it was Game 7 of the Finals. No slowing down. No pacing themselves. Just buckets, buckets, buckets.\n\n \n\nNash opened the fourth with a slick no-look dime, threading the needle in transition.\n\n \n\nChen Yan caught it in stride and rose with elegance for a soft one-handed dunk—like a dragonfly kissing the rim.\n\n \n\nHe could've thrown it down harder—he had the bounce—but he chose finesse.\n\n \n\nWhy?\n\n \n\nBecause the game wasn't over yet. And he had to conserve whatever energy he had left.\n\n \n\nThe Wizards were coming.\n\n \n\nChen Yan had just drilled a tough bucket, but there was no time to celebrate with Nash—Washington was already sprinting down the court.\n\n \n\nJamison caught the ball from the baseline and fired a quick outlet. Arenas raced past half court, gave a hard jab as if to pull up from deep, then faked and dished it off to Caron Butler on the cut.\n\n \n\nBAM!\n\n \n\nButler slammed it home with authority.\n\n \n\nBefore Butler could even land, Chen Yan had already taken the ball out and launched a full-court baseline pass, hitting Nash near midcourt in stride.\n\n \n\nWithout missing a beat, Nash whipped a perfect lob ahead to Stoudemire, who was waiting wide open under the rim.\n\n \n\nTwo laser-guided quarterbacks. One vicious transition play.\n\n \n\nThe Wizards didn't stand a chance. They could only turn and watch as Stoudemire hammered it down.\n\n \n\nTurns out, on the previous play, Stoudemire hadn't even bothered to run back on defense—he'd been camping in the frontcourt, baiting the fast break.\n\n \n\nBack in China, viewership for the game was exploding.\n\n \n\nIt was a weekday, and people were just getting off school or work. And the first thing fans did when they got home? Turn on CCTV5 and catch Chen Yan in action.\n\n \n\nWhat greeted them was an all-out shootout. Fast breaks. Heat checks. Monster dunks.\n\n \n\nFans were loving it.\n\n \n\nAnd it wasn't just Chinese fans either. Across the ocean, American audiences were tuned in too.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nLos Angeles, California – Taylor Swift's Apartment\n\n \n\nTaylor sat cross-legged on her couch, eyes glued to the screen.\n\n \n\n\"You said you had plans tonight, and your plans were watching basketball?\" Carly Kloss raised an eyebrow, genuinely surprised.\n\n 5\n\nThe 6'1\" supermodel stood behind the couch, her long legs even more dramatic in person.\n\n \n\nThen Chen Yan appeared on-screen in a close-up.\n\n \n\nCarly leaned in, squinting at the TV. \"Okay… he's kinda sculpted though. That profile? He could be in a Marvel movie or walk a runway in Milan.\"\n\n \n\nShe tapped the screen. \"His face has that sharp Asian edge. Bro would pop off even without the NBA.\"\n\n \n\n\"Hey! Carly, back up! You're gonna fog up my screen,\" Taylor laughed, playfully pulling her friend away.\n\n \n\n\"Come on, Tay. Don't be greedy. Handsome guys belong to the public!\"\n\n \n\n\"Nope,\" Taylor said, smirking. \"That one's mine.\"\n\n \n\nThey both burst into laughter.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nBack to the Game – 3:00 Remaining | Suns 117 – Wizards 115\n\n \n\nThings were getting tight.\n\n \n\nThe Suns still held a slim lead, but their early dominance had faded. The Wizards' big three were on fire.\n\n \n\nGilbert Arenas brought the ball up the floor.\n\n \n\nPhoenix had to get a stop here. A bucket from Washington would shift all the momentum.\n\n \n\nBarnes got the defensive assignment on Arenas. Gritty, physical, and unrelenting, Barnes had that signature spiderweb tattoo wrapped around his elbow—a symbol of his grind-it-out defensive mentality.\n\n \n\nArenas was struggling to shake him. He used multiple screens, weaving left and right, trying to create separation.\n\n \n\nPhoenix switched.\n\n \n\nNow, Chen Yan stood in front of him.\n\n \n\nArenas signaled for isolation.\n\n \n\nCrunch time.\n\n \n\nThis was his moment. Everyone knew it—he wasn't giving up the ball.\n\n \n\nThe clock ticked under 10 seconds on the shot clock.\n\n \n\nBoom! Arenas exploded off the dribble. No hesitation. No wasted motion. Just brute strength and confidence.\n\n \n\nHe'd gone at Chen Yan multiple times tonight and gotten the better of him.\n\n \n\nBut this time… Chen Yan was ready.\n\n \n\nHe anticipated the first move, slid over early, and the moment Arenas tried to cross back—\n\n \n\nSNATCH!\n\n \n\n\"CRACK!\"\n\n \n\nThe ball popped loose!\n\n \n\n\"Damn it!\" Arenas barked as Chen Yan picked his pocket clean and took off in transition like a rocket.\n\n \n\n\"He got him!\"\n\n \n\n\"What a steal! Chen Yan timed that perfectly!\" Zhang Heli shouted from the broadcast booth.\n\n \n\nChen Yan was already past half court, eyes locked in, with just one man left in front of him—Butler.\n\n \n\n1-on-1.\n\n \n\nChen Yan hit the gas.\n\n \n\nJust past the free throw line, Butler squared up.\n\n \n\nHere it comes—[Magic Shadow Step].\n\n \n\nA slick right-to-left crossover. Lightning fast.\n\n \n\nBut Butler was sharp. He didn't bite on the first move and stayed balanced, cutting off the lane.\n\n \n\nA perfect defensive read.\n\n \n\nBut Chen Yan wasn't done.\n\n \n\nHe kept his cool, read Butler's feet, and in that split-second hesitation, he changed the plan.\n\n \n\nInstead of forcing a drive, Chen Yan pulled up in rhythm on his second step, rising smooth with a soft flick of the elbow.\n\n \n\nFloat game. High arc. Clean release.\n\n \n\n\"Swish!\"\n\n \n\nThe net barely moved.\n\n \n\n\"After that footwork, you don't have to dunk. You don't even need a layup,\" the announcer raved.\n\n \n\n\"That little teardrop floater hit like a dagger!\"\n\n \n\nWith that shot, it wasn't just two more points.\n\n \n\nIt was a statement.\n\n \n\nChen Yan had just leveled up.\n\n \n\nHis feel for the game, his mastery of footwork, and his understanding of the Phantom Step had just hit another tier.\n\n \n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\n \n\nCheck my Pâtreon for Advanced Chapters\n\n \n\nPâtreon .com/Fanficlord03\n\n \n\nChange (â) to (a)\n\n \n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\n \n\nhttps://discord.gg/MntqcdpRZ9",
