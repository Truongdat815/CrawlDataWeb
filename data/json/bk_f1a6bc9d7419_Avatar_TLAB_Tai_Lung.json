            "content": "Tai Lung sat in his small cage with a hollow spirit. The once-mighty warrior now felt his strength sapped, not by a worthy glorious battle, but by the foul trickery of the tiny chameleon he looked down upon. She had stolen his chi… and with it, his kung fu. Once, he stood proud, fierce, unmatched. Now, he could barely move his body. When the fat panda had defeated him long ago, Tai Lung had hated it, but he had understood it. That fight had not been just a clash of skill. The fat panda, as ridiculous as he seemed, was chosen. Destined. The Dragon Warrior. Fated to win. In time, Tai Lung had come to accept it. The old turtle had been right, he was not the dragon warrior, he was not destined to the greatness he believed. But in the Spirit Realm, things had been different. He had found a path again, a chance to train and improve, a chance to rise higher than before, until Kai, the old warlord, crushed it. That fight… Tai Lung could justify that loss. Kai had taken him off guard, and already held the chi of dozens of masters. He was older, experienced beyond mortal years. Defeat then was bitter, but not shameful. Tai Lung had become a jade, a mere energy source. Still, he could live with that disgrace. But now? Now it was different. He had been bested by a chameleon. A weak, slippery thing. A trickster without true strength. She had no right… no right to win against him. And yet she had. Tai Lung's claws trembled against the cold iron of his cage floor. His thoughts spun in circles. Was his skill fading? Or had his pride blinded him for too long? For the second time in his life, doubt crept into his mind, sharp and cold like a dagger. He did not know how long he sat there. Time had lost all meaning. Then… he saw him. Po. The fat panda. After all these years, sneaking around. Even in his weakened state, Tai Lung snarled and lashed, rage boiling up from the depths of his wounded pride. It didn't matter that Po had been the Dragon Warrior. It didn't matter that fate had chosen him. Why him? Why had Oogway decided that he was worthy? What made that bumbling, dim-witted panda so special? And yet… Tai Lung watched. He watched Po, alongside that annoying little sidekick, face the chameleon, the same one who had defeated him. But this time… the panda won. The chameleon, now bloated with the stolen chi and skills of dozens of masters, was still no match for Po. And Tai Lung knew then, with a bitter twist in his gut, that he himself would have lost too. He was too weak. At that moment, she was far stronger than him. When the cages broke and he was freed, he stood among the other masters. All walking toward Po. He didn't speak. Anger burned in his chest, but he didn't lash out. Not this time. A part of him screamed at him that he had missed something all along. Something important. Something that mattered more than strength. Standing before Po, he finally spoke. \"I take back what I said,\" Tai Lung murmured, voice rough like gravel. \"Maybe… Oogway was right after all.\" And then, slowly, painfully, he bowed. The gesture was surreal even to him. What else could he do? Po had saved him. He had defeated the chameleon, again and again proving his strength was more than muscle or skill. Tai Lung couldn't bear it. The shame twisted in his gut like a blade. All he wanted in that moment was to leave. To return to the Spirit Realm. To be free from this humiliating reminder of his failure, of his insignificance. Po, ever gentle, nodded and waved his staff. From it, two golden dragons rose into the air and spiraled around a tear in the fabric of reality. A gate to the Spirit Realm shimmered open. Tai Lung stepped forward, gripping the chameleon tightly. She screamed, thrashed, her form flickering. But she was weak now, too weak to escape Tai Lung's iron grip. He stepped through the gate last. Within the Spirit Realm, the other masters stood waiting. Silent. Watching. All eyes turned to the defeated chameleon in Tai Lung's grasp. Anger burned behind every gaze. Justice, vengeance call it what they would. Tai Lung didn't care. He hurled the chameleon forward, letting her collapse at their feet. \"Yours,\" he said flatly. Then he turned and walked away. He didn't care what they would do to her. They wouldn't let her go easily, he knew that much. But he didn't want part in it. Not now. He needed… solitude. He wandered for a long time. The Spirit Realm was vast and strange. Floating islands, glowing trees, endless skies. He walked until he stumbled across a familiar presence. Master Oogway. The old turtle sat, serene, meditating with eyes closed. Peaceful as ever. Tai Lung's breath caught. He hesitated. Then, slowly, he stepped closer. Oogway's eyes opened. He smiled, warm and gentle. \"This is the first time you've sought me out,\" he said softly. Tai Lung didn't respond at first. His jaw tightened. Then, finally: \"How did you know?\" he asked. \"How did you know I wasn't the Dragon Warrior? How could you see the darkness and the destiny of someone?\" Oogway hummed, the sound like a breeze through leaves. \"I didn't,\" he said. \"But a true Dragon Warrior is humble. You were prideful. Had you chosen to accept my decision, to let go of your pride… perhaps you could have been the Dragon Warrior.\" Tai Lung's ears flicked. His eyes narrowed. \"So it was a test,\" he said bitterly. \"And I failed.\" Oogway's voice turned firm, but not harsh. \"You are here because you still refuse to see your own faults. You blame me. You blame Shifu. You even blame Po. But the truth is… bitterness and rage were forged into your being. You refuse to accept the past and let go of your rage.\" Tai Lung didn't reply. For a moment, he wanted to attack the old turtle but he stopped himself, it was pointless, it won't change anything regardless of the outcome. Oogway continued \"But more importantly, did you truly want to be the Dragon Warrior? Was that dream your own?\" Tai Lung didn't answer, he knew what the old turtle meant, he wanted to be the Dragon Warrior just to make Shifu proud. Shifu believed he was destined for greatness, so he would get that greatness. In the end, Tai Lung turned away, his silent leave was louder than words. Oogway watched him go, a tinge of disappointment and pity in his wise old eyes. Then, he closed them again and returned to his meditation, the wind carrying a whisper of regret through the stillness. Tai Lung moved silently between the floating islands of the Spirit Realm. The mist parted for him as he leapt across the ancient floating rocks and islands, each step landing with controlled precision. Eventually, he reached a relatively large island, peaceful and empty, distant from the others. He stood at its center, the stillness pressing in around him like a cold fog. Oogway's words echoed in his head. 'A true Dragon Warrior is humble.' Tai Lung's jaw tightened. Humble? That was ridiculous. Pride didn't mean darkness, it meant he had something that made him better than others, made him worthy. All of his life was about making his father proud, nothing brought his life meaning and joy like the praise of his father. That was Oogway's clue to his darkness? Did Oogway really think that? or did he choose to lie to him? Tai Lung shook his head, it was too late now to think about it. \"I don't want to be weak, I don't want to lose again\" Tai Lung muttered under his breath, claws curling into fists. He narrowed his eyes, took a deep breath, and dropped into a stance. The air around him shifted as he began to move. Punches. Kicks. Fluid strikes of his kung fu. His muscles surged with every motion. The energy inside him churned, coiled like a dragon ready to strike. With each blow, more and more of his chi surged outward, rippling through the air in radiant pulses. He needed to be better. Faster. Stronger. Deadlier. He moved with renewed purpose, a storm of motion on the quiet island. His strikes cracked the ground beneath him, the air trembling with the force of his will. Each motion released more chi, the brilliant light began trailing his limbs like afterimages of pure power. Then… he noticed it. A tree nearby began to glow. Tai Lung froze mid-strike, panting softly. He turned slowly toward the source. The tree's bark shimmered with red light, deep, resonant and alive. He had never seen this before in the Spirit Realm. He approached it cautiously, eyes narrowed, all senses alert. The tree hummed, a low, musical vibration that thrummed through his chest like a heartbeat. Energy swirled around it, strange and ancient. He reached out. As his fingers touched the bark, a flash of light consumed him. Suddenly, he felt as though he were submerged in water. Cold. Heavy. Silent. His body was weightless, but unresponsive, he couldn't move his limbs, couldn't breathe, couldn't scream. Panic surged inside him, but there was no air, no way to cry out. Then he surfaced. Air filled his lungs, though he hadn't realized he'd needed it. Before him stood a towering being, tree-like in form, but far stranger. Its body was composed of wood and shimmering spirit-light, and atop its trunk, several heads bloomed like grotesque flowers. The creature spoke in a calm, feminine voice. \"This is the first time I see a spirit like you,\" it said. \"You are not supposed to be here.\" Tai Lung tried to respond, but his voice didn't work. His limbs wouldn't move. He only stared, helpless. The creature paused, then spoke again. \"No matter, you shall return to the cycle of life.\" There was no warning, only a surge of light. It engulfed him again. And then… warmth. Softness. Tai Lung blinked. He couldn't move, couldn't speak, but he could see. He was no longer in the Spirit Realm. He was in the arms of… something. An animal unlike any he had seen before, but its face was gentle. Loving. It looked down on him with what he could only describe as a smile. The creature spoke, voice trembling with joy. \"I am finally holding my son.\" Another voice drifted in, warm and teasing. \"Our son.\" Then, more firmly: \"As we agreed… we shall name him Tai.\" Tai Lung's eyes fluttered slowly, trying to make sense of this impossible moment. He couldn't move. Couldn't speak. Only stare. The two strange animals held him gently between them, gazing down with affection and awe. And just like that… Tai Lung's story began again.\n\nTai Lung sat in his small cage with a hollow spirit. The once-mighty warrior now felt his strength sapped, not by a worthy glorious battle, but by the foul trickery of the tiny chameleon he looked down upon. She had stolen his chi… and with it, his kung fu. Once, he stood proud, fierce, unmatched. Now, he could barely move his body.\n\nTai Lung sat in his small cage with a hollow spirit.

Now, he could barely move his body.\n\nWhen the fat panda had defeated him long ago, Tai Lung had hated it, but he had understood it. That fight had not been just a clash of skill. The fat panda, as ridiculous as he seemed, was chosen. Destined. The Dragon Warrior. Fated to win. In time, Tai Lung had come to accept it. The old turtle had been right, he was not the dragon warrior, he was not destined to the greatness he believed.\n\nWhen the fat panda had defeated him long ago, Tai Lung had hated it, but he had understood it.

He had found a path again, a chance to train and improve, a chance to rise higher than before, until Kai, the old warlord, crushed it. That fight… Tai Lung could justify that loss. Kai had taken him off guard, and already held the chi of dozens of masters. He was older, experienced beyond mortal years. Defeat then was bitter, but not shameful. Tai Lung had become a jade, a mere energy source. Still, he could live with that disgrace.\n\nBut in the Spirit Realm, things had been different.

Now it was different.\n\nHe had been bested by a chameleon. A weak, slippery thing. A trickster without true strength. She had no right… no right to win against him. And yet she had. Tai Lung's claws trembled against the cold iron of his cage floor. His thoughts spun in circles. Was his skill fading? Or had his pride blinded him for too long? For the second time in his life, doubt crept into his mind, sharp and cold like a dagger. He did not know how long he sat there. Time had lost all meaning.\n\nHe had been bested by a chameleon.

Even in his weakened state, Tai Lung snarled and lashed, rage boiling up from the depths of his wounded pride. It didn't matter that Po had been the Dragon Warrior. It didn't matter that fate had chosen him. Why him? Why had Oogway decided that he was worthy? What made that bumbling, dim-witted panda so special?\n\nPo. The fat panda.

But this time… the panda won. The chameleon, now bloated with the stolen chi and skills of dozens of masters, was still no match for Po.

Anger burned in his chest, but he didn't lash out. Not this time. A part of him screamed at him that he had missed something all along. Something important. Something that mattered more than strength.\n\nWhen the cages broke and he was freed, he stood among the other masters. All walking toward Po. He didn't speak.

What else could he do? Po had saved him. He had defeated the chameleon, again and again proving his strength was more than muscle or skill. Tai Lung couldn't bear it.

From it, two golden dragons rose into the air and spiraled around a tear in the fabric of reality. A gate to the Spirit Realm shimmered open. Tai Lung stepped forward, gripping the chameleon tightly.

            "content": "Tai Lung had been reborn, somehow. He didn't understand the how or why, only that he was now trapped in the fragile body of a helpless child. And not just helpless, also humiliating. The once-proud warrior who had challenged masters and stormed the Jade Palace now relied on soft-spoken strangers for food, warmth, and survival. To make things worse, time crawled. He was growing way too slow. He had been alive in this new form for over a year and still could barely take more than a few shaky steps before falling face-first into the ground. His legs were pathetically weak. Each fall was a fresh insult. [This is the price of failure] he thought grimly. Every time he tried to walk, his two caretakers, his supposed parents, cheered him on with wide smiles and gleaming eyes. Their excitement grated at him. He watched them warily, unsure of what species they even were. They called themselves humans, but Tai Lung had never seen such creatures before. Still, identity didn't matter for now. What mattered was strength. Growth. Survival. The role of a son? That could wait. He focused on building muscle and balance. What little he could do. Stretching. Standing. Testing his grip. Trying forms in secret. But every attempt was met with amused chuckles and warm laughter. His parents thought it was adorable. \"Look at my son growing! You will become a great warrior one day\" his father said once, ruffling Tai Lung's hair. Tai Lung merely turned away, jaw clenched, refusing to acknowledge them. He had to keep his mind focused. It was the only thing he could control. By the time he turned two, his tongue and throat had developed enough for speech. He couldn't yet articulate everything, but he could form words, express needs, ask questions. The first time he spoke clearly, both his parents gasped. \"Our son is a genius!\" his mother had exclaimed, pulling him into her arms. \"He's going to be a scholar, I just know it!\" Tai Lung said nothing. Let them dream. He had no desire to become a scholar, but now, with words, he could gather information. He asked questions. Not too many, not too deep, just enough to satisfy his curiosity. Where were they? What was this place called? What were they? His parents, patient and cheerful, explained everything. They were humans, they said. They lived in a land called the Fire Nation, one of the four great nations. A land where people could bend fire. Tai Lung blinked in confusion. \"Fire… bend?\" His father smiled and stood. \"Let me show you.\" With a calm stance and a slow breath, his father punched the air and fire erupted from his fist. Tai Lung stared, stunned. He had trained under Shifu, fought the Dragon Warrior, faced warlords in the Spirit Realm, but this? To summon fire from your limbs with ease? It was unlike anything he had seen. And his father said many people in the Fire Nation could do it. [Was this advanced kung fu? Or something else entirely?] Tai Lung wondered. He didn't know. But it filled him with both curiosity and caution. Still, despite his seriousness, there were moments when Tai Lung's lack of knowledge betrayed him and made him into a joke. One afternoon, his father came home with a group of creatures called turtle ducks, placing them in a small backyard pool for decoration and calm. Tai Lung's eyes widened when he saw them. He padded over cautiously and sat near the edge of the pool. He leaned forward, watching the turtle ducks intently. Then, without thinking, he began trying to talk to them. \"Hello, I am Tai Lung, pardon me for asking, but what are you?\" he said. After some silence he frowned and spoke again \"Can you understand me? It is rude to ignore who is talking to you\" The creatures tilted their heads. Quacked. Blinked. His parents, watching from the side, burst into laughter. \"Oh, sweetie!\" his mother giggled. \"You can't talk to turtle ducks!\" Tai Lung turned to them with an innocent, confused expression. \"Why not?\" Still chuckling, she knelt beside him. \"Because turtle ducks and all animals can't talk. They're not like people.\" Tai Lung blinked. His mind froze. \"…what?\" he said. His mother exchanged a look with her husband. \"Animals don't talk, sweetheart. They don't think the way we do. They eat, sleep and run. That's all. Only humans can truly speak.\" Tai Lung stared at the ducklings. At his mother. Then his father, who nodded gently. The horror bloomed inside him like a cold flower. [They aren't intelligent? They don't speak, not because they won't, but because they can't?] It made no sense. In his old life, creatures of all kinds could speak. Tortoises. Rabbits. Birds. Pigs. Even insects had personalities. But here… His mother giggled and rubbed his back. \"It's alright, sweetie. You'll be able to talk with other children like you in due time.\" His father laughed as well, while the turtle duck jumped into the water with a splash. Tai Lung didn't laugh. He sat frozen, staring at the water with wide, disturbed eyes. His parents saw only a confused child trying to make sense of the world and continued laughing, unaware of the deep, quiet existential crisis their son was having. ___________ Time moved forward, slowly, but surely. And with it, the strangeness of this world continued to unfold before Tai Lung's watchful eyes. By now, Tai Lung was certain that this was a completely different world from the one he used to live in, it was no hidden corner from his old world. This was entirely different. The animals were foreign, unrecognizable from those he had once fought beside or against. The laws of nature felt alien, fire that responded to will, stone that could rise at a thought. The very map of the land was unfamiliar, the names of nations echoing nothing from his old life. The only comfortingly familiar thing was the language. The words, the grammar, the tone, it was the same. And it only made the differences stand out more starkly. Tai Lung devoted himself to learning about this new world. He asked carefully curated questions, filtered his curiosity behind the innocent lens of a bright child. And his parents, always doting on him, answered with pride. The Lung family, they told him, was a noble house in the Fire Nation. A bloodline of elite firebenders and respected admirals, known for generations of military excellence and devotion to the Fire Lord. Their contributions to the war had earned them prestige and responsibility. War. The word came up often in his lessons, in conversations, in the stories his father told. For nearly a century, his nation had been locked in conflict. The Fire Nation, his family claimed, stood for order and progress. They had defeated the evil Air Nomads who clung to outdated ideals. Now, they fought against the barbaric Water Tribes and the corrupt Earth Kingdom, who refused to accept the Fire Nation's vision for a united world. It was all said with such certainty. With pride. But Tai Lung listened in silence, withholding judgment. The words \"evil\" and \"barbaric\" were easy to use during war; he had seen that before in the Jade Palace scrolls. His father, Admiral Lung, was a towering man, stern yet warm in his private moments. He had remained at home for the first three years of Tai Lungi's life, a decision he called his 'greatest honor.' He trained in the courtyard, carried Tai Lung on his shoulders, and spoke to him about ships, strategies, and firebending forms in a simplified manner that can keep a child curious and excited. But the war called him back. Tai Lung remembered the day his father stood at the gate, wearing his full armor, his back straight and gaze firm. His mother clung to him for a moment longer than she usually would, her face calm but her hands trembling. \"Don't worry,\" the admiral said softly, brushing her hair back. \"No enemy can defeat me.\" He knelt beside Tai Lung, placing a firm hand on his son's head. \"Grow strong, Tai. Lead with fire in your heart.\" Then he left, his silhouette disappearing into the horizon with the soldiers of his fleet. After that, Tai Lung's mother resumed her routine. She smiled, sang, and cared for Tai with grace. But her eyes lingered too long on the horizon. Her hands paused sometimes when folding clothes. And when she thought Tai Lung wasn't looking, she'd sit quietly by the window, holding her husband's old scarf in silence. Tai Lung saw all of it. He didn't speak of it. Didn't ask. He merely nodded when she smiled and kept his expression blank when her gaze wavered. Instead, he focused inward. He honed his small, soft body with discipline. He stretched. He moved. He trained. Slow as it was, strength would return. One day, he would reclaim the power that once made even masters fear his name. This wasn't the world he knew, but he would rise in it, just as he had in the last, but this time he was going to stand at the very top. He won't be a loser again.\n\nTai Lung had been reborn, somehow. He didn't understand the how or why, only that he was now trapped in the fragile body of a helpless child. And not just helpless, also humiliating. The once-proud warrior who had challenged masters and stormed the Jade Palace now relied on soft-spoken strangers for food, warmth, and survival.\n\nTai Lung had been reborn, somehow.

            "content": "Tai Lung's fists struck the air in practiced, deliberate patterns, precise and powerful, or as powerful as a child could manage, still it was far beyond what anyone his age should be capable of. His breathing was steady, his mind focused, his form near-flawless for someone with a body so small and undeveloped. His mother watched from the veranda, arms folded beneath her sleeves, a conflicted expression on her face. It had been weeks now, months even, and Tai Lung rarely did anything but train. She had tried once again that morning, gently kneeling by his side and offering a warm smile. \"Tai, why don't you go play with the other children for a while? There's a festival in the market today. I'm sure they'd love to have you join.\" Tai Lung had paused only briefly before replying in his usual calm, quiet voice, \"I enjoy this more. I'll stop before I overdo it.\" Then, without waiting for her response, he resumed his solitary routine, leaving his mother silently watching him, unsure whether to admire or worry. Yet despite her unease, there was no denying his passion. He wasn't training out of obligation or mimicry, he wanted this, he enjoyed it for some reason she couldn't grasp. But since that was the case, then she would support him properly as his mother to best of her ability. The next week, two new faces arrived at their estate. One was a seasoned firebender and martial arts master, gruff but sharp-eyed, his posture commanding even in stillness. The other, a thin, well-groomed man dressed in long red robes, introduced himself as a tutor of etiquette and general education for noble families. Tai Lung welcomed the change. He didn't resist the decision, on the contrary, he found it advantageous. Knowledge offered freely from experienced individual was better than piecing it together through silent observation and self training. And firebending? Master the art had become the flame that fed his very soul. From the moment he began formal lessons, he noticed something strange. His body, while still developing, felt different inside. He could sense an additional energy center, a seventh chakra point, that hadn't existed in his old life. He suspected this was what allowed humans in this world to bend elements with such ease. And he intended to master it, just like he master the thousand kung fu scrolls in his past life. It didn't take long for his firebending teacher, Master Ronzu, to become astounded. Tai absorbed each lesson like a sponge. Movements, breathing techniques, stances, he remembered everything, applied everything, improved by the hour. There was fire in his strikes that shouldn't have existed yet. The teacher often stood speechless, then quickly shifted into excitement. Tai Lung's talent was undeniable, the greatest he had ever seen. But if Master Ronzu's lessons were thrilling, the other teacher's lessons were the opposite. The etiquette tutor, Meisho, lectured endlessly on posture, titles, tea ceremony rules, greeting gestures, and a hundred other trivial details that Tai could not care less about. He tried, truly, but many of these customs seemed so arbitrary. What did it matter how deep you bowed, or which spoon was used first at a banquet? Still, he endured it. He did not protest. His parents had given him more than he could repay, and bringing shame to their house was not an option. So he nodded through lectures, memorized rules, and made sure his responses were perfectly polite. Seasons passed. One evening, in her private quarters, Lady Lung sat at her desk with a fresh scroll of parchment and began to write. The dim candlelight flickered gently as she poured her thoughts into words. My dearest husband, I hope this letter finds you safe and strong. I miss you terribly. Tai is growing so quickly, he is already speaking fluently and learning at an astonishing rate. His teachers can't stop praising him. Master Meisho says Tai is the most obedient, intelligent, and perceptive child he's ever taught. He believes Tai has the makings of a great future statesman. And Master Ronzu, he is beside himself. He claims Tai's firebending progress is beyond belief. That within a year or two, Tai will possess the raw power of an adult bender. He insists Tai must attend the Royal Academy. Anything less would be a waste of divine talent. He calls him a firebender born once in a millennium, greatness is his destiny. I am so proud of our son. You would be too. I pray for your victory every night and look forward to the honor you'll bring when you return home. She set the brush down and released a slow, tired breath. Her eyes lingered on the closed window. It had been over a year since she last saw her husband. The silence of his absence echoed loudly at night. Her gaze drifted toward the outer garden where Tai Lung often trained. Her son was a marvel, bright, driven and disciplined. She felt nothing but pride watching him grow. And yet… a shadow lingered. Tai Lung didn't play like the other children. He didn't laugh with them. He showed no interest in toys, in games, in companionship. His world revolved entirely around training and firebending. It was as though he were a miniature adult in a child's skin. She hoped it would change. \"Next year,\" she whispered to herself, \"he'll enter the Royal Academy. There, he'll meet other children. He'll learn to laugh. To live. To do something beside training\" She pressed her hand against her heart, as if holding that hope in place. And outside, in the moonlight, Tai Lung continued his silent routine, fire swirling around his small hands as he trained for the life ahead. ___________ Tai Lung stood in the center of the training courtyard, his bare feet planted firmly on the stone tiles, the morning sun glinting off his sweat-covered skin. His breathing was calm and measured as he exhaled and with it came fire, fierce and controlled. A flame danced from his palm, twisting and curling with precision. He had done it. With the guidance of Master Ronzu and tireless personal training, Tai Lung had finally reached a point where he no longer feared losing control. Fire answered his will now. It came when summoned and vanished when dismissed. No longer did he scorch the grass without him meaning to. His mastery had grown. And now, he was ready to go further. Alone in the quiet hours between lessons, Tai Lung began to test beyond the standard teachings he received. He returned to the foundation of his old life, Kung Fu, and began experimenting, weaving fire into his strikes, kicks, and movements. It started simple. A jab followed by a jet of flame. A sweeping kick that left a trail of fire in its wake. But soon, his curiosity drove him deeper. What if he could enhance the fire not with movement, but with his chi? He focused inward, calling forth the energy that had once been second nature to him. As he channeled fire through his arm, he guided chi along with it, but kept it contained, not letting the energy leave his body until the moment just before the flame emerged. The result was dramatic. The fire surged in size and strength, roaring out like a wild beast suddenly unchained. It was hotter, wider, more aggressive. Yet when Tai Lung tried it again, this time allowing the fire to leave his body first before infusing it with chi as it escaped, something incredible happened. The fire turned blue. It flared brighter and burned far hotter than anything he had seen before. It danced like liquid lightning, dangerous and beautiful. He stared at his hand, astonished, the last wisps of blue flame fading into the air. Driven by curiosity, he approached Master Ronzu the next day. \"Teacher,\" Tai Lung asked, \"are there other forms of firebending? Like… different types of fire?\" The old man nodded. \"Only a few in each generation develop talents that go beyond the norm. The royal family, for example, they can bend lightning, a highly advanced form of fire. Others, rare ones in our history, have been able to produce blue flame, a hotter and more destructive flame. But such talents are uncommon. Most of us follow the standard teachings.\" That answer, though vague, gave Tai Lung clarity. The firebenders of this world didn't truly understand why some people could bend lightning or blue fire. It wasn't taught like the other fire bending forms or passed down through known techniques, it simply was something the talented few can do once they follow some steps. They used chi in every movement, in every flame they summoned, but they didn't consciously know it or precisely control it. Not the way he did. They were walking a path blindfolded. He had lived that path. So Tai Lung made a decision. He would keep his findings, his blue fire and his chi experiments, to himself. For now. There was still so much to learn about this world. Its bending, its people, its philosophies. He needed to understand more before he revealed anything. Especially the secrets held by the royal family. He would bide his time and watch, wait for the opportunity to witness lightning bending firsthand. Until then, he would train in silence, he would grow to become a feared warrior like his previous life.\n\nTai Lung's fists struck the air in practiced, deliberate patterns, precise and powerful, or as powerful as a child could manage, still it was far beyond what anyone his age should be capable of.

            "content": "The courtyard was still that morning, the sun glinting faintly across the rows of wooden dummies scarred by fire. Tai Lung's breaths came in heavy bursts, his body dripped with sweat, muscles trembling from the endless sequence of strikes, kicks, and firebending drills that Master Ronzu demanded of him. And then, quite suddenly, his knees gave way. his back hit the floor with a dull thud, chest heaving, vision spinning from sheer exhaustion. He looked up at Master Ronzu, whose calm eyes observed him without surprise. \"Apologies,\" Tai Lung managed between ragged breaths. \"I am too tired to continue. Give me thirty minutes, and I will be able to continue.\" Master Ronzu gave a short nod, but there was something thoughtful in his expression. His brow furrowed slightly as he muttered under his breath, \"He definitely has a unique body.\" His words were quiet, barely louder than a whisper, but Tai Lung's sharp hearing caught them. He raised his head slightly. \"How is my body unique?\" he asked, voice steady despite his exhaustion. Master Ronzu blinked in surprise, clearly taken aback. \"You heard that?\" Tai Lung nodded once. The old master regarded him in quiet wonder before replying, \"You train too hard, and for too long. Someone your age shouldn't have that kind of endurance and stamina. In fact, this is my first time pushing someone your age this hard\" Tai Lung pushed himself up to a sitting position, still breathing heavily. \"I have been training nonstop for a while now. It is only natural for my stamina and endurance to grow\" Ronzu shook his head, his lips twitching as though he found the boy both impressive and troubling. \"Even children a few years older than you shouldn't possess your speed, strength, and endurance. There is a limit to how fast you can grow, but it looks as if it doesn't apply to you. Moreover, it takes you only thirty minutes to recover from complete exhaustion to the point where you can continue with the same pace. Even adults won't be able to do that.\" His eyes softened slightly as he added, almost reverently, \"That's a blessed body by Agni, if I ever saw one.\" Tai Lung's golden eyes lifted toward him. \"So I am growing too fast compared to humans? How fast does a human grow normally?\" Master Ronzu let out a short, hearty laugh. \"I praise you a little and you start to ask like you're not a human.\" Tai Lung said nothing. He merely kept staring, his expression questioning and serious. Ronzu's laughter faded. He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. \"Compared to others, you are not,\" he admitted. \"Your body looks a year or two older than it should. Many twelve or thirteen years have less stamina, speed, and strength than you, not to mention your firebending. It's extraordinarily powerful for your age.\" Tai Lung nodded lightly, his mind already spinning. He had long concluded that humans grew slower than animals had in his previous life, but hearing Master Ronzu's words made him realize it was even worse than he'd imagined. Still, if humans were truly that limited… why was he different? Did he really possess some kind of special body? or did he do something special unintentionally? Before he could dwell further, Ronzu spoke again, his voice calm but firm. \"Don't let that get to your head. Even a normal person will be able to surpass you if they train hard enough while you're slacking.\" For a brief instant, Po's round, smiling face flashed in Tai Lung's memory, a reminder of his past arrogance and underestimating his opponent. He quickly dismissed it. \"You don't need to warn me,\" Tai Lung said, his tone quiet but laced with conviction. \"I know that very well. I don't plan on slacking now or underestimating anyone.\" Master Ronzu didn't seem to take the boy's seriousness too deeply; he merely nodded, satisfied that his student understood the lesson. \"Tai Lung, You are meant for greatness. I know that\" Master Ronzu said with a smile. Tai Lung didn't react to his words, just stared at the dummies in front of him. But deep down, he hated these words, regardless of the truth behind them, because they reminded him of Shifu. —————— The night was still, Tai Lung sat cross-legged in his room, his breathing slow, steady. Between his fingers hovered a small, trembling blue flame. It danced upon his palm like a living spirit, flickering in rhythm with his heartbeat. He gazed at it quietly, Master Ronzu's words echoing in the back of his mind. 'A blessed body by Agni, if I ever saw one'. [Was there truly something special about him?] he wondered silently. The thought gnawed at him. He carried the knowledge and skills from his previous world, his previous life, to this one. In that life, his body had been forged in battle and under the discipline of Shifu, as unyielding as stone and sharp as blades. Yet this body, this fragile, human form was soft, unarmed. No claws, no fangs, no fur to shield it. Even the strongest adults he had seen lacked the raw power and speed his former self once possessed. Could such creatures ever rival what he used to be? He doubted it. His flame quivered as he pondered. Perhaps his faster growth had nothing to do with fate or divine blessing. Perhaps it was his training, the endless hours of toil based on the training he knew from his past life, maybe it was just the unique training that drove his body to surpass others his age and nothing more. But even that didn't make complete sense. His chi, after all, had barely increased since he came here. Then, a sudden clarity pierced his mind, a spark of understanding brighter than the flame in his palm. [My chi… it's as strong as it was in my last life!] His eyes widened. [I didn't start over… I carried it with me when I came here.] The revelation hit him like a bolt of lightning. His fingers clenched instinctively, and the little blue flame vanished in a puff of smoke. He sat frozen, feeling the pulse of chi that thrummed within his veins. Chi was life itself. It strengthened the body, quickened its healing, sustained its spirit. Yet his chi, vast and refined, had not been reborn anew. It did not grow with him, it was already there along with his spirit, immense and mature, waiting for his body to catch up. That was why his body developed and surged beyond its limits. It wasn't a gift. It was the necessity of flesh and bone struggling to harmonize with the power caged inside, with his mature spirit. The realization stirred something within him. There was a hope for him to reach similar feats of physical ability similar to his old body. His potential, at least as a human, was greater than most not because he was chosen or blessed, but because he had begun this life already ahead of others, born carrying the chi of a warrior from another world. His memories, his training, all of it would hasten that growth even further. Master Ronzu's words returned to him, soft yet haunting. \"You are meant for greatness.\" He stared into the empty air where the flame had been. [No,] he thought bitterly.[ I wasn't born with a special body. I wasn't meant for greatness. I was merely born with the effort of my past life.] The truth did not fill him with pride. There was no joy, no warmth in the knowledge. Only a quiet, hollow ache, the sense that he was a fraud, a pretender blessed by nothing but borrowed strength. A cheater born in the wrong world, competing for a destiny isn't his. He closed his eyes, exhaling slowly, forcing the thoughts away. They would lead him nowhere but despair. [I will focus on my training,] he told himself. [That's enough. Nothing else matters.] And as the night deepened around him, Tai Lung reopened his hand. A new flame, calm and golden this time, bloomed to life in his palm. He stared into it without a word.\n\nThe courtyard was still that morning, the sun glinting faintly across the rows of wooden dummies scarred by fire.

            "content": "The courtyard echoed with the rhythmic beat of fists striking the air, fire flickering in bursts with every motion. Tai Lung moved fluidly, each step measured, each breath controlled, his mind and body aligned in harmony. The sun cast long shadows across the ground, glinting off his sweat-drenched brow. Then he sensed a presence calm, composed, and heavy with authority. Tai Lung paused mid-strike, turning his head toward the entrance of the courtyard. A tall man in a dark red uniform stood there, the uniform was different from regular uniforms, at a glance anyone who is not familiar with uniforms will still recognize it as a uniform of a high ranking soldier. The man's face was sharp, weathered by the elements of war, but his eyes were warm. Tai Lung took a breath, bowed lightly, and said with calm respect, \"Welcome back, Father. Glad to see you returned safe and sound.\" Admiral Lung smiled, stepping forward with deliberate grace. \"My son has grown so much... I have been away all of these years and despite how long that was, you can still recognize me. I am glad you didn't forget my face\" The admiral took in the sight of his son, the boy's face was still young, but a glint of sharpness in these golden eyes gave the feeling Tai Lung will grow to be someone exceptional. \"It would be shameful not to recognize my own father,\" Tai Lung replied. The admiral laughed, a deep and proud sound. \"I'm glad I've returned. To see my wife and my son with my own eyes again… nothing in the world can match this moment.\" Tai Lung gave a soft nod in return. He could see the genuine happiness and relief in his father eyes. That evening, the family of three gathered together for the first time in years. Lanterns lit the room with a gentle glow, and the admiral, still dressed in his formal robes, shared tales from the front lines. He spoke of naval conquests, strategies that led to victories, and the honors bestowed upon him by the Fire Lord himself. His tone was light, carefully tailored to keep the horrors of war out of reach for his young son. But Tai Lung wasn't like other children. Behind each filtered tale, he heard the screams, the chaos, the bloodshed. The fire and steel. Though his father smiled, Tai Lung saw the shadows in his eyes, he understood perfectly the carnage that such achievements demanded. Later in the conversation, Admiral Lung turned to Tai Lung with a glint in his eye. \"Next week, you'll be joining the Royal Academy. And you won't be the only one,\" he added. \"Prince Zuko, son of Prince Ozai, will also be attending. He comes from a divine bloodline but with your talent, I believe you'll be able to keep up.\" Tai's eyes gleamed with intrigue. A member of the royal family. A firebender with divine heritage and if rumors were true, one who would one day master lightning. The chance to observe him, perhaps even learn from him… it was too valuable to ignore. The next day came swiftly. Admiral Lung stood tall in the courtyard, arms crossed behind his back. \"I want to see your progress with my own eyes,\" he said. \"Show me what you've learned, son.\" Tai Lung bowed respectfully. \"Yes, Father.\" He took his stance and began to move, martial strikes flowing one into the next like water turned to flame. Fire blossomed from his limbs, roaring to life in perfect synchrony with his movements. Though he held back, refraining from using chi-enhanced movement or the blue flames he had unlocked, his technique and control were a marvel to witness. The admiral's eyes widened. He had seen countless firebenders in his long career, soldiers, lieutenants, prodigies. But his six-year-old son… the discipline, the control, the intensity, Tai was more capable than many adult soldiers he had commanded. The only advantage they had over his son was their body size and battlefield experience. When Tai Lung finished, he stepped back and looked up at his father, silent and awaiting judgment. Admiral Lung coughed lightly, composing himself. \"You're much better than I expected. Definitely the best I've seen at your age.\" A proud pause. \"But,\" he added, his voice returning to the tone of a seasoned commander, \"you still have a long way to go before becoming a true firebender and master.\" Tai Lung nodded without hesitation. He understood. There was always more to learn, more to refine. But even so, he knew where he stood. With Master Ronzu's teachings as a reference, his performance was above the average fire bender. With time, he shall be at the very top. ___________ Late at night, Tai Lung lay on his bed, eyes fixed on the ceiling as thoughts drifted through his mind. A full month had passed since he began attending the Royal Academy. He had entered the school with excitement, eager to learn new martial arts, meet great teachers, and most of all, encounter Prince Zuko, the child of divine blood said to wield great power. But the reality had been a disappointment beyond belief. The so-called finest academy in the Fire Nation was mediocre at best. The general education classes were dull and repetitive. Tai Lung had combed through the curriculum for the rest of the year and found nothing he hadn't already learned under Meisho's private tutelage. The firebending lessons were even worse, clumsy stances, weak breath control, and instructors who spoke as if reading from scrolls rather than lived experience. He was years ahead of the class. It wasn't an exaggeration to say he was already qualified to graduate. Then there was the prince himself, Zuko. Tai Lung had anticipated someone who radiated brilliance or possessed overwhelming skill. But Zuko was just… average. No remarkable insight, no natural dominance, no spark of genius. He was like every other student, indistinct and unimpressive. It left Tai Lung questioning the legends he has been hearing. Was the story of divine bloodlines nothing more than myth? Did the royal family keep their true teachings secret? Or was Zuko simply the black sheep of his lineage? Tai didn't have an answer, but one truth was clear, continuing in that academy was a waste of time. Back home, two or three years are enough for most species to reach adulthood, but humans need ten or twelve years at minimum. Tai Lung didn't want to stick around to watch the human children grow up. The very next morning, he brought the matter up with his parents over breakfast. \"I want to withdraw from the academy,\" Tai Lung said plainly. \"I can train and learn on my own much faster than sitting through those classes for the next seven years.\" But his parents immediately dismissed the idea. \"It's important for you to interact with other students,\" his mother said firmly. \"It's not just about learning,\" Admiral Lung added. \"It's about understanding the people around you, learning how to stand among them. To learn our values and what it means to be honorable. That is as important as the fire in your veins.\" Tai Lung attempted to explain again, to point out the glaring inefficiency, the wasted hours, the lack of challenge. But neither of his parents budged. Their decision was final. Reluctantly, Tai Lung obeyed. For now, he had to accept the painful slow growth rate of humans. ___________ Meanwhile, in the royal palace, dinner was served in golden silence. Ozai sat at the head of the table, flanked by his wife Ursa and his children, Azula and Zuko. The air was still, save for the clinking of porcelain and silver. Then Ozai looked up from his plate and narrowed his eyes at his son. \"I've been hearing from your school,\" he said coolly. \"Your performance is not up to royal standards.\" Zuko flinched, his grip tightening on his chopsticks. Across the table, Azula smiled faintly, while their mother's expression darkened with concern. \"He just entered the school,\" Ursa said calmly. \"You can't judge him like that so soon.\" But Ozai's gaze didn't shift. \"Zuko is a prince of the Fire Nation,\" he said. \"Yet he is consistently overshadowed by his classmates, especially Admiral Lung's son. That boy has been at the top of every class since the first day.\" He leaned forward, his voice colder now. \"I expect you to rival, or even surpass, this classmate of yours. Anything less is simply a failure and that is not acceptable for a son of mine.\" Zuko lowered his head and whispered, \"Yes, Father.\" The fire flickered in the nearby lanterns, but none burned hotter than the silent pressure settling over the prince's shoulders. ___________ The next day, Ursa walked through the palace courtyard with Zuko beside her, the boy unusually quiet as he trudged along. As they turned a corner near the training grounds, a familiar voice called out. \"Ursa! Nephew!\" Crown Prince Iroh stood at the end of the walkway, smiling broadly as he approached them with his usual warm demeanor. \"Uncle,\" Zuko said flatly, giving a small nod before continuing to walk past. He didn't stop, nor did he look back. Iroh's smile dimmed slightly as he turned to Ursa, concern flickering in his eyes. \"Is Zuko alright?\" Ursa let out a quiet sigh. \"Ozai is putting too much pressure on him. He scolded Zuko for not being the top of his class. Apparently, a son of some admiral is outshining him.\" Iroh frowned and shook his head slowly. \"Ozai has always been too harsh... Do you know which admiral?\" \"Admiral Lung,\" she replied. Recognition lit Iroh's face. \"Ah, Lung! I didn't realize his son was Zuko's age.\" A fond smile touched his lips. \"Shulian Lung is an old friend of mine, a good man, disciplined and loyal. Perhaps I can help.\" Ursa tilted her head. \"Help?\" Iroh nodded. \"Why not introduce Zuko to Lung's son? Let them become friends, maybe even rivals. That kind of companionship could inspire and strengthen them both.\" Ursa's expression softened with gratitude. \"I can't thank you enough, Iroh. Zuko needs someone like that right now.\" Iroh waved it off with a chuckle. \"He's my nephew. It's my duty and my joy to help him.\"\n\nThe courtyard echoed with the rhythmic beat of fists striking the air, fire flickering in bursts with every motion. Tai Lung moved fluidly, each step measured, each breath controlled, his mind and body aligned in harmony. The sun cast long shadows across the ground, glinting off his sweat-drenched brow.\n\nThe courtyard echoed with the rhythmic beat of fists striking the air, fire flickering in bursts with every motion.

            "content": "Later that day, Iroh summoned Zuko and told him they were going to visit an old friend of his, an admiral of the Fire Nation, one of the best the Fire Nation military had. Zuko's eyes lit up. \"Really? An admiral?\" He straightened his posture, trying to look more presentable, excitement filling his eyes. Soldiers and war heroes were figures he looked up to, and the chance to meet a high ranking hero who led their soldiers to victories was a rare opportunity to him. The two of them made their way to Admiral Lung's estate, a large but modest home that reflected dignity rather than extravagance. When they arrived, a servant opened the front gate. Her eyes widened the moment she saw the crown prince standing before her. \"Your Highness!\" she said, quickly stepping aside and bowing deeply. \"Please, come in. I will fetch the master of the house at once!\" Zuko stepped inside, eyes scanning every detail, while Iroh nodded politely and followed her lead. They were guided to the guest room, where the two sat on finely crafted chairs. Zuko looked around curiously at the decorations, the paintings of dragons and ships adorning the walls. Meanwhile Iroh simply waited with a serene expression. A moment later, footsteps echoed through the hall, and a tall, broad-shouldered man entered with a beaming smile on his face. \"What an honor to have the crown prince in my home!\" Iroh stood and returned the smile warmly. \"Shulian, my friend. It's been a while.\" The two men bowed briefly in the traditional Fire Nation greeting clasp. \"I've been impressed by the war reports I've received,\" Iroh continued. \"Your leadership was remarkable.\" Shulian Lung grinned. \"Coming from the Dragon of the West, that means a great deal.\" Zuko watched them quietly, admiration already growing in his eyes. The two great warriors sat side by side, catching up as old friends do. They reminisced over past campaigns, shared thoughts on current military strategies, and exchanged news of old comrades. After a moment, Iroh leaned back and chuckled. \"I must say, I was surprised to hear your son has joined the Royal Academy.\" Shulian nodded with a smile that brimmed with pride. \"Yes, he has. The boy is growing fast. I didn't truly realize how fast until I came back from my last assignment. He's not the little boy I remember.\" Iroh returned the smile, amused and curious. \"Where is your son now?\" Shulian gestured toward the back of the house. \"He's in the backyard, training. Let me go bring him to greet you properly.\" But Iroh raised his hand gently. \"No need. I wouldn't want to interrupt his lesson.\" \"It's fine,\" Shulian said with a wave of his hand. \"Tai is training alone. There's no lesson to interrupt.\" Iroh lifted a brow. \"You don't have a tutor for him?\" \"We did,\" Shulian replied calmly. \"But with the school, it's not necessary anymore. Besides, Tai is already over six years old. He knows how he should train.\" Iroh blinked at his old friend absurd statement and thought to himself [Six years old is too young to be training alone] He wanted to say something, but then stopped himself. The look on Shulian's face was filled with unwavering pride. Iroh chose to remain silent on the matter and instead said, \"Then I'd like to see the boy training, if you don't mind. I admit I'm curious.\" Shulian nodded at once. \"Of course.\" He led the two royals through the house. Zuko followed closely, his curiosity growing with every step. He hadn't realized this was Tai Lung's home or that Admiral Lung was his father. Hearing the name and knowing Tai Lung was out back training piqued his interest deeply. Tai Lung was always ahead of him in class. No matter how hard Zuko tried, Tai Lung always stood out, always shone brighter. Now, finally, he would see what Tai Lungi did outside school. When they reached the courtyard, they found the boy standing alone, punching and kicking at the air with repeating movements. Each strike released a small, controlled burst of flame that dissipated shortly after forming. Zuko blinked at the sight. The movements were sharp and impressive, but the fireballs seemed too small to him. [I could make bigger flames than that] he thought. Zuko felt a sense of self satisfaction at that thought. But Iroh's eyes narrowed as he observed. He noticed immediately what Zuko could not, each flame was exactly the same. Same shape. Same size. Same intensity. Each move released the same amount of power and control. That kind of consistency was something most of the adults couldn't pull off, it was something only true firebending masters achieved after years of disciplined training. And here it was, executed perfectly by a boy the same age as Zuko. Shulian spoke softly, his voice calm but filled with restrained emotion. \"Tai's been training like this before he even turned four. His dedication to firebending is astonishing. But...\" He paused for a heartbeat. \"I admit it concerns me sometimes.\" Despite the concern in his words, Iroh could hear the unmistakable pride underneath. He looked at Shulian, then at the boy. Iroh thought. [Any father would be proud to have a son like that.] It was no wonder Zuko was being outperformed. Iroh couldn't think of a single bender in his memory who reached that level of control at six years old. He glanced at Zuko, who stood there oblivious to the gap. Iroh had brought Zuko here hoping they could become friends and rivals, equals who could learn from each other. But now, it was clear to him, if anything, Zuko would be the one doing the learning. Tai Lung stopped and turned, his eyes noticing the three visitors. He caught sight of Zuko, then the man beside him. Shulian raised his hand and called, \"Tai, come greet our guests.\" Tai Lung walked toward them with calm steps and bowed slightly. \"Welcome, Prince Zuko. Welcome, Crown Prince Iroh.\" Iroh smiled and hummed. \"How did you know I was the Crown Prince and not prince Ozai or anyone else?\" Tai Lung replied evenly, \"You are accompanying Prince Zuko and Father told me stories about the Dragon of the West. The description matches yours.\" Iroh let out a short, warm laugh. \"Clever. And your performance just now, that was quite the surprise.\" He looked at Zuko, who stood a bit straighter under his uncle's gaze. \"His dedication to learning is impressive, don't you think, nephew?\" Zuko was caught off guard by the sudden question, but quickly recovered and nodded. \"Yes, very impressive.\" Iroh smiled and turned back to Tai Lung. \"Why don't you two play together while your father and I talk about boring things only grown up men enjoy?\" Zuko nodded obediently. Tai Lung, on the other hand, glanced at his father with a pleading look in his eyes, silently begging to be spared. But Admiral Lung only smiled and said, \"Tai, show Prince Zuko around, and do your best to be a good host.\" With that, Iroh and Shulian turned and walked off, their voices fading into conversation. Now alone, Zuko and Tai Lung stood in the courtyard. Zuko hesitated for a moment, then asked, \"So, Tai Lung… what do you do for fun?\" Tai Lung replied simply, \"I train.\" ___________ Iroh sat down, his gaze thoughtful as he looked at his old friend. \"How did you manage to raise your son like that? I have never seen someone his age reach such an advanced level. And what do you feed him? He looked a year or two older my nephew \" Shulian gave a calm shrug. \"I did nothing special. When Tai was younger, I showed him firebending. Since then, he's been training non-stop. If he's not sleeping, eating, or reading, he's outside training. I never pushed him to do any of it. What you saw today is the result of his dedication.\" Iroh nodded lightly, still visibly impressed. \"This is the first time I've heard of a child doing that on his own.\" Shulian gave a small sigh, part pride and part concern. \"He's smart, talented, and his mind is focused on a singular goal. All he wants to do is train and learn. He even wanted to drop out of the Royal Academy, saying he could learn and train better on his own. In truth, that's been a source of worry for me and his mother. He's obsessed with firebending. He doesn't like to play or meet people.\" Iroh stroked his beard, a thoughtful look settling on his face. \"Then perhaps it's a good thing that my nephew and your son become close friends. Tai Lung can push the little prince to grow stronger... and Zuko can be a friend Tai Lung clearly needs.\" Shulian considered it for a moment, then nodded with a small smile. \"That would be good for both of them, I think.\" Their conversation shifted naturally to more pressing matters. Iroh leaned in slightly, lowering his voice. \"I'm planning to move against Ba Sing Se. The Earth Kingdom's great city\" Shulian's eyes narrowed. \"You're planning a siege?\" Iroh nodded. \"I want the support of the other generals and admirals. We'll need approval to mobilize and help with logistics. It's going to be a major operation.\" Shulian crossed his arms. \"That's going to be a costly siege. A difficult one.\" \"I have a plan,\" Iroh said with conviction. \"And I believe it will work. I can break through.\" Shulian fell quiet for a moment, eyes distant. Then he gave a solemn nod. \"We've been friends for decades, Iroh. If you're going, whether you succeed or fail... I will always have your back.\" Iroh smiled at that, a genuine warmth in his expression. \"Thank you, friend.\" They spoke a while longer about the war, the generals, and the weight of strategy. Eventually, Iroh stood up. \"I've taken too much of your time. I need to meet with my father, the Fire Lord.\" Shulian stood as well. \"Of course. Let's fetch Prince Zuko.\" They walked back toward the courtyard. When they arrived, they found Zuko lying on the ground, panting heavily, dirt smeared across his clothes and face. Not far from him, Tai Lung was still practicing, the same as before. \"What happened here?\" Shulian asked, puzzled. Zuko didn't respond, still catching his breath. Tai Lung stopped his movements and turned. \"The prince wanted to train with me... but he got tired.\" Iroh stepped forward, kneeling slightly beside his nephew. After a quick look to ensure he was unharmed, he asked, \"Nephew, can you stand?\" Zuko nodded and pushed himself up, wobbling on shaky legs. Iroh chuckled softly. \"Let's go back to the palace so you can rest properly.\" Shulian and Tai Lung walked them to the outer gate. Once Iroh and Zuko had departed, Shulian looked at his son. \"You didn't beat the prince, did you?\" Tai Lung looked up at his father. \"He trained a little and dropped, as you saw. I don't think the prince would survive a beating. He is too soft.\" Shulian sighed. \"He is royalty, Tai. Be nice to him.\"\n\nLater that day, Iroh summoned Zuko and told him they were going to visit an old friend of his, an admiral of the Fire Nation, one of the best the Fire Nation military had.\n\nLater that day, Iroh summoned Zuko and told him they were going to visit an old friend of his, an admiral of the Fire Nation, one of the best the Fire Nation military had.\n\nLater that day, Iroh summoned Zuko and told him they were going to visit an old friend of his, an admiral of the Fire Nation, one of the best the Fire Nation military had.\n\nZuko's eyes lit up. \"Really?

            "content": "Tai's life continued as it had always been calm, focused, and solitary. School filled his mornings, training consumed his afternoons, and when the sun dipped below the horizon, he read and studied firebending scrolls. The only foreign element in his otherwise disciplined life was the occasional presence of Prince Zuko. The young prince would visit from time to time to train with Tai Lung. Though Tai Lung found Zuko's presence somewhat annoying, he tolerated it. There was something respectable about the prince's effort. Tai Lung could see it clearly, Zuko was trying, with all his might, to match him. Whenever Zuko came by, his mother, Ursa, often accompanied him. She would stay with Tai Lung's mother, and over time, the two women became friends and began confiding in each other some of their worries. Despite the growing bond between their mothers, Zuko's many invitations for Tai Lung to visit the royal palace were all politely declined. Not once did Tai Lung accept. Like this, two years passed in a blink. The steady rhythm of life shattered with a thunderous declaration: the Crown Prince was planning an assault on Ba Sing Se, the Earth Kingdom's greatest city. The impenetrable stronghold. Among those who would accompany the Crown Prince on this historic campaign was Tai Lung's father, Admiral Lung, along with other seasoned generals and admirals. The day of departure arrived. Families gathered near the docks, their faces tense with silent prayers and tight embraces. This time was different, this wasn't a small deployment or a minor skirmish. This was a siege. A full-scale assault against the Earth Kingdom's mightiest force. Tai Lung stood quietly on the deck of the commanding ship. From his spot, he watched his mother embrace his father, her eyes shut tightly, her lips whispering a desperate prayer for his victory and safe return. When they pulled apart, Admiral Lung turned to his son. \"Don't slack off while I'm away.\" \"That should be the last of your concern,\" Tai Lung replied firmly. \"I pray for your victory, Father.\" A moment later, the Crown Prince Iroh boarded the ship with his son, both dressed in the uniform of the Fire Nation's military. Iroh approached Admiral Lung, his tone direct but cordial. \"Admiral Lung, we should prepare to leave.\" The admiral gave a respectful nod. \"Of course, Crown Prince.\" Before departing, Iroh turned to Tai Lun. \"I thank you for being a friend to Prince Zuko. I hope you will continue to be one.\" Tai Lung gave a slight nod, then paused for a moment. His eyes locked with Iroh's. \"Crown Prince Iroh… would it be fine if I made a request before you leave?\" The sudden words drew the attention of everyone nearby. Mothers, officers, even soldiers turned their heads in curiosity. Iroh tilted his head slightly. \"Let me hear it.\" \"I want to see how to bend lightning,\" Tai Lung said. Admiral Lung frowned deeply. \"Tai Lung , it is not appropriate to make such a request.\" But Iroh raised a hand gently. \"It is fine. It's the curiosity of a child and a simple request.\" With measured steps, Iroh walked toward the edge of the ship. He exhaled calmly, closing his eyes. Slowly, with fluid grace, he began the motions drawing in the energy, channeling it through his body. A sharp crackle split the air, and a bolt of lightning burst from his fingertips into the open sea, dazzling all who watched. Tai didn't blink. His eyes followed every movement with undivided focus. Iroh turned to him, his expression solemn. \"This is a very dangerous skill, for both the bender and the target. Without proper guidance or sufficient talent, attempting it can harm the one who uses it. And if it lands, the target will be gravely injured. I showed it to you so you understand, not just how it is done, but how dangerous it truly is.\" Tai gave a respectful bow. \"Thank you, Crown Prince, for indulging my request.\" ___________ The night sky above the Fire Nation was full with faint starlight as Tai Lung slipped silently into the courtyard. Everyone in the house had gone to sleep, but sleep would not come to him. His mind was ablaze with the memory of Iroh's lightning bending, every motion, every breath, every shift in stance. He had replayed it countless times in his head, and now he moved. His hands traced the same fluid pattern, his feet grounded in balance, his breath synchronized with his flow of chi. Slowly, carefully, he limited his chi output as he mimicked the crown prince's form. A faint crackling began in the air around him. Sparks danced between his fingertips, and then a thin arc of lightning formed and lashed up into the sky with a sharp hiss. Tai Lung narrowed his eyes, studying the arc's behavior before it dissipated in the air. He could feel it, the energy's wild instability beneath his control. Without his precise mastery over his chi, it would have burst chaotically and injured him. Lightning was nothing like flames. It was volatile, explosive, unforgiving. And yet… Tai Lung smiled. It was a step. A first spark on the road to mastery. In time, he would command it fully. As with all things, he would train, and in time, he would dominate even lightning. Another year passed by in a blur. Tai Lung's routine never wavered: school, training, study, more training. Occasionally, news from the frontlines filtered through. The Crown Prince's siege had successfully severed Ba Sing Se from the rest of the world, and the campaign had lasted more than ten grueling months. The strain on the Fire Nation army was evident, but it was hoped that the Earth Kingdom forces were suffering even more. Back in the capital, another kind of siege continued, Zuko's unwavering attempts to bring Tai Lung to the royal palace. After nearly three years of Tai Lung's persistent refusal, Zuko's mother, Ursa, took matters into her own hands. She extended a personal invitation to Tai Lung's mother and, this time, insisted she bring Tai Lung along. His mother readily agreed, delighted at the chance to visit the palace and share time with her new friend. For the first time, Tai Lung would enter the royal palace. In one of the palace courtyards, Zuko stood awkwardly beside his younger sister Azula and her entourage. Azula wore a mischievous grin as she stood with her arms folded. \"So,\" she said, \"we're finally going to meet Zuzu's only friend.\" Ty Lee clapped her hands lightly. \"This might be fun! Someone new coming here.\" \"Hopefully he's not as bad as Zuzu,\" Azula added with a smirk. Mai sat silently beneath the shade of a tree, legs under her, listening to her friends. Zuko's eyes narrowed at his sister. \"Don't bad-mouth my friend.\" Azula rolled her eyes. \"I'm comparing him to a prince. Is that bad-mouthing?\" Zuko clenched his fists. \"You know what I mean. If you do that again…\" \"What?\" Azula cut him off mockingly. \"Are you going to run to Mom?\" Before Zuko could answer, a pair of figures entered the courtyard. Their conversation stopped as Ursa stepped in, followed by Tai Lung and his mother. All eyes turned to the newcomer. Ursa smiled gently at the children. \"This is Tai Lung, Zuko's friend. Play together and be nice. Do you hear me, Azula?\" Azula blinked and returned a sugary smile. \"I'm always nice to Zuzu and his friends.\" Zuko rolled his eyes in exasperation, while Ursa sighed and turned to leave with Tai Lung's mother. As they walked off, Tai Lung's mother chuckled softly. \"Azula seems to be as energetic as you said.\" Ursa gave her a look. \"Believe me, nothing I told you will be enough to describe her.\" ___________ Zuko waved as Tai Lung approached. \"I'm glad to see you here,\" he said warmly. \"Let me introduce you. This is my sister, Azula. That's Ty Lee\" he gestured to the cheerful girl who waved energetically with a bright smile \"and that over there is Mai.\" Mai sat under the tree silently, not even bothering to acknowledge the introduction. Azula stepped forward, eyes scanning Tai with sharp curiosity. \"So, you're Tai Lung,\" she said coolly. \"The one who caused Father to punish Zuko so many times.\" Zuko's face flushed red. \"Azula!!\" Azula rolled her eyes. \"Oh please, everyone knows about it.\" She refocused on Tai Lung, folding her arms. \"I heard you're a prodigy firebender and the best in the Royal Academy, seeing you now, at least you don't look timid like my dear brother. But are you really his age?\" Tai Lung noticed the gleam of competition in her eyes along with desdain, but he didn't rise to it. \"Okay,\" he said flatly, then turned to Zuko. \"Where can we train?\" Azula frowned, clearly not used to being dismissed. \"That's all you have to say?\" she asked. Tai Lung looked at her calmly. \"Yes, I'd rather just spend my time training.\" Zuko grinned at the exchange, pleased with how dismissive Tai Lung was of his sister. \"Come, I will show you the training grounds,\" he said eagerly, leading Tai Lung away. Behind them, Azula narrowed her eyes, irritation bubbling in her chest. Then, suddenly, a smile curled her lips. With no warning, she charged forward, thrusting her hand out and launching a fireball straight at Tai Lung's back. Tai Lung heard it coming. In one fluid motion, he spun around, waved his hand, and dissipated the flame in the air. Before Azula could react, he stepped in, grabbed her by the neck, and brought her down to the ground with a swift, controlled movement. The courtyard went still, Zuko and the girls stared surprised at the turn of events. Azula groaned softly under the pressure before Tai Lung let go of her and stood. \"I would expect a princess to have propriety,\" he said calmly, then turned his back to her and walked away. [It seems Zuko is the decent one in the family, the sister is acting like a one month old bull despite her old age.] Tai Lung thought to himself silently. Zuko burst out laughing, delighted. \"Come on,\" he said, leading Tai Lung to the training area with renewed enthusiasm. Azula slowly stood, rage simmering in her eyes. Ty Lee, eyes wide, said in awe, \"That's the first time I've seen someone beat you.\" Azula turned to her, and Ty Lee immediately went silent, taking a cautious step back. Azula looked toward Tai Lung's retreating form. [I will definitely beat him for today] she thought, fire dancing in her angry eyes.\n\nTai's life continued as it had always been calm, focused, and solitary. School filled his mornings, training consumed his afternoons, and when the sun dipped below the horizon, he read and studied firebending scrolls. The only foreign element in his otherwise disciplined life was the occasional presence of Prince Zuko. The young prince would visit from time to time to train with Tai Lung.

After nearly three years of Tai Lung's persistent refusal, Zuko's mother, Ursa, took matters into her own hands.

            "content": "A few days after his visit to the Fire Lord's palace, Tai Lung received another visit from Zuko. This time, however, he wasn't alone. With him were Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai. Zuko looked less than thrilled by the company, clearly having failed to talk Azula out of joining them. Azula, for her part, had insisted on coming along. Tai Lung, already irritated by the disruption to his usual routine, now found the group even larger. But his annoyance was met with his mother's elation. She was overjoyed to see her son spending time with others, believing he was finally breaking out of his shell. That glad, relieved look on her face made it impossible for Tai Lung to say anything, even though the situation grated on his nerves. To his surprise, the girls didn't just idle around or just annoyed him with endless chatter; they actually joined in on the training. Azula, in particular, tried to mimic Tai Lung's movements, her eyes locked onto his technique with an intense competitive gleam. Ty Lee bounced around energetically, practicing her acrobatics and flexibility, while Mai opted for a quieter activity, calmly throwing knives and any other sharp objects she could get her hands on at nearby targets. As much as their presence annoyed him, Tai Lung found it nowhere near as bad as he had initially expected. The girls were talented, determined, and not a complete distraction. Azula's fierce spirit shone with every failed attempt to copy him, and while Tai Lung largely ignored her, he quietly noted that Zuko could benefit from even half of his sister's drive. The group returned to Tai Lung's house days later, and the same events unfolded again. Then it happened again, and again, until it became a routine. Every few days, they would come over and train. Tai Lung didn't mind that anymore. What did bother him, oddly enough, was his mother. She would occasionally peek into the training yard, watching silently. At first, she was happy. But now her expression had shifted into something more complex, conflicted, sometimes even troubled. In her eyes, Tai Lung's passion for training seemed to have become infectious, affecting even noble girls from the palace. All of them were constantly sweaty, focused, and eager to improve. His mother, once glad, now felt guilty. She had thought their first visit would be the last when she saw them training, but here they were training junkies just like her son. Tai Lung noticed. He always noticed. His mother's eyes weren't angry, but unsettled. He chose to say nothing and instead focused on what he could control. Ty Lee, for instance, had talent. Natural, raw talent for acrobatics. Her joy in flipping, leaping, and balancing reminded Tai Lung of his old life, when Kung Fu masters would train acrobatic forms with reverence and glee. Something about her movements stirred old memories. Perhaps out of nostalgia, or something else, Tai began devoting some of his time to training her. He showed her moves she had never seen before, techniques from a past no one but he knew. Ty Lee, in turn, was ecstatic. Finally, someone who knew more than her and who was willing to teach her. Meanwhile, in the background, Zuko and Mai would sneak glances at one another. There were small blushes, awkward eye contact, and quick looks away. Something soft and unsaid lingered between them. Azula, however, watched all of this with growing bitterness. She felt left out. The princess of the Fire Nation, ignored. Completely overlooked. Especially by Tai Lung, who gave most of his attention and effort to Ty Lee, a girl who only knew how to juggle and bounce. Sometimes, he would show Mai tricks in throwing weapons, sometimes he would help Zuko, but when it came to Azula, the firebending prodigy, she was completely dismissed by him. She challenged Tai Lung to spar often, trying to prove herself. Every time, she lost. Miserably. Quickly. Brutally. Her frustration mounted with each defeat. She was supposed to be strong. She was destined for greatness. And yet she kept losing. To Zuko's classmate. And the worst part? There was nothing she could do about it. ___________ Today's visit was different. For the first time, the children arrived without Azula. Tai Lung noticed immediately but didn't say a word. It was Ty Lee who pointed it out, bouncing up to him with her usual energy and curiosity. \"Did you not notice Azula's missing?\" she asked, tilting her head. Tai Lung gave a short nod. \"I can see that.\" Ty Lee blinked, surprised. \"You're not curious why?\" \"Not really,\" Tai Lung replied, his tone flat. Zuko stepped in to answer anyway, a trace of bitterness in his voice. \"She stayed behind. Father wanted to teach her personally.\" \"I see, good for her\" Tai Lung said, his expression unchanged. Then, without missing a beat, he turned to Ty Lee. \"Did you practice the triple air kick from last time?\" Ty Lee's demeanor brightened instantly. \"Yes! I did! I learned it!\" she exclaimed, practically radiating pride and excitement. With that, the group moved into their usual routine. Training resumed as normal, perhaps even better than normal. The lack of Azula's presence didn't bother anyone. In fact, it seemed to lift a weight off the group. Without her sharp tongue and constant competitive jabs, the air felt lighter. The laughter came easier. Ty Lee was more expressive. Even Mai seemed just a little more relaxed, her quiet stillness less like detachment and more like peace. They all felt it, even if they didn't say it. The day was simply better without Azula. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the vast Fire Lord Palace, Azula stood proudly in a private courtyard, her golden eyes gleaming with fire and fierce determination. Her father loomed before her, a proud figure of power and control. Today, he was her teacher. She moved through her forms with razor precision, her flames hotter, her strikes faster. She had only one thought. With Father's training… I will beat Tai Lung. I will show him who the real prodigy is. From that day on, Azula's visits stopped entirely. ___________ After six hundred days of relentless siege, the long-awaited news finally came, Ba Sing Se's outer wall had been breached. But instead of celebration, the Fire Nation was plunged into sorrow and outrage. The son of Crown Prince Iroh, Captain Lu Ten, had fallen during the final push. The cost of this achievement had been too high. Not long after, Iroh called off the siege and ordered a retreat, his heart was broken after the loss of his son and couldn't continue the siege. The war, which had seemed to be on the cusp of a major turning point, was suddenly stalled. Across the Fire Nation, whispers grew into heated debates. Some called Iroh weak, accusing him of throwing away the sacrifices of countless soldiers. Others grieved with him, understanding that the pain of losing a son could shatter even the strongest of hearts. But before the nation could process the grief, a second shock swept across the capital the very next day. The Fire Lord was dead. His final decree was revealed, Prince Ozai would become the new Crown Prince, bypassing Iroh, whose retreat was declared a failure too great to overlook. With that, Ozai rose as the new Fire Lord. The capital buzzed with both anxiety and awe as citizens flooded the ceremonial grounds to witness the transfer of power to the new Fire Lord. Among the silent crowd stood Tai Lung. He watched the grand procession with serene, observant eyes. Fire Nation banners waved, flames danced in ritual arcs, and chants echoed in reverence of the new ruler. Yet something was off. He scanned the platform, the nobles, the royal family. Zuko and Azula were there but Ursa, Ozai's wife, was missing. A few days later, Zuko came to visit Tai Lung's home, his expression clouded with confusion and sorrow. He sat beside Tai Lung and spoke quietly, as if the words themselves were heavy. \"My mother disappeared the same night my grandfather died,\" Zuko said. \"No one will tell me where she went. Azula… Azula told me something else. She said Grandfather was going to kill me. To make Father feel the same pain as Uncle Iroh. Azula always lies but I can't help but fear that my mother was killed in my place.\" Tai Lung listened, his gaze fixed ahead, unmoving. Something in his gut twisted. There was more to this than anyone knew. The Fire Lord's death. Ursa's disappearance. Tai Lung there was a covert murder mixed with greed to rule the nation. But after a moment of silent thoughts, Tai exhaled slowly. [It has nothing to do with me.] He thought to himself. And just like that, he buried the thought. That was the last time Zuko visited his home. In the Royal Academy, Zuko began to avoid Tai completely. No explanation, no confrontation, only distance, growing colder by the day.\n\nA few days after his visit to the Fire Lord's palace, Tai Lung received another visit from Zuko. This time, however, he wasn't alone. With him were Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai. Zuko looked less than thrilled by the company, clearly having failed to talk Azula out of joining them.

Something about her movements stirred old memories. Perhaps out of nostalgia, or something else, Tai began devoting some of his time to training her. He showed her moves she had never seen before, techniques from a past no one but he knew. Ty Lee, in turn, was ecstatic. Finally, someone who knew more than her and who was willing to teach her.\n\nMeanwhile, in the background, Zuko and Mai would sneak glances at one another. There were small blushes, awkward eye contact, and quick looks away. Something soft and unsaid lingered between them.\n\nMeanwhile, in the background, Zuko and Mai would sneak glances at one another.

She felt left out. The princess of the Fire Nation, ignored. Completely overlooked. Especially by Tai Lung, who gave most of his attention and effort to Ty Lee, a girl who only knew how to juggle and bounce. Sometimes, he would show Mai tricks in throwing weapons, sometimes he would help Zuko, but when it came to Azula, the firebending prodigy, she was completely dismissed by him.\n\nAzula, however, watched all of this with growing bitterness.

            "content": "With the end of the siege, it was expected that Admiral Lung would finally return home. But he didn't. Instead, a surprising order was issued by the new Fire Lord Ozai, the admiral was to lead a campaign in the northern seas, hunting down pirates and Water Tribe barbarians. Many were stunned. Such a mission didn't require an admiral, any competent commander could have handled it. Yet the order stood, and Admiral Lung remained away. Tai Lung watched as the news reached his mother. Her ecstatic face, lit by hope, slowly crumpled as the realization sank in, her husband would not be returning for another year or two. The weight of disappointment was unbearable to witness. For all intents and purposes, Ozai's order was a punishment cloaked as duty. In the months that followed, the once-lively group visits faded. Now only Ty Lee came, occasionally seeking Tai Lung's help with her training. At first, her visits were hesitant, awkward in their solitude. But when she saw how little Tai Lung cared about her being alone, she quickly relaxed into the routine. One afternoon, while practicing a complex flip-kick sequence, Ty Lee paused and sat beside Tai Lung, wiping sweat from her brow. \"Zuko... he's avoiding you now because the Fire Lord told him to,\" she admitted, frowning. \"Azula told me that the fire lord considered it unbecoming of the Crown Prince to spend time with the son of a mere admiral.\" Tai Lung's expression remained passive, but something shifted in his eyes. Ty Lee pouted, arms crossed. \"I think it's stupid. The Fire Lord ruined our group... our friendship... everything.\" Then she caught herself. \"Please don't tell anyone I said that.\" Tai Lung nodded slightly. Of all her words, only one truly echoed in his head: mere admiral. That people in this world could speak so casually, so dismissively, of his father, it grated on him in a way few things did. Two years passed. Tai Lung was now twelve years old. He stood tall and silent at the docks beside his mother, the sea breeze brushing against his face. After four long years, his father was finally coming home. The warship docked slowly. The soldiers disembarked, and then Admiral Lung appeared. Time had weathered his face, but his posture remained firm, his eyes sharp. Tai Lung's mother teared up as she rushed forward, arms open. \"I missed you,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"It's been four years…\" Tai Lung approached a step behind her. \"Welcome back.\" The admiral smiled tiredly, but genuine. His eyes lingered on his son, now taller, stronger, with an air of quiet command most men twice his age lacked. For a moment, the years of battle and exile-like mission melted away. He was home. That night, the family celebrated in quiet comfort. Over a warm meal, Admiral Lung recounted tales of the siege, the endless tension, the final breach, and the heartbreak that followed. But his voice faltered when he mentioned Prince Iroh. Shulian sighed deeply. \"The loss of Lu Ten... it broke him. And then, just days later, he lost his claim to the throne.\" \"Where is Prince Iroh now?\" Tai Lung asked. \"I don't know,\" his father replied, shaking his head. \"He left the army on his own. He said he needed time, and no one's seen him since.\" Shulian's eyes narrowed. \"The moment Ozai took power, he sent me on that ridiculous mission. That wasn't a coincidence.\" \"Why would he do that?\" she asked. \"Because I was close to Prince Iroh,\" he answered grimly. \"All of us who stood with him, generals and admirals alike, were given missions that kept us far from the capital. He feared Iroh might come for the throne.\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed recalling the past, then shared what Zuko had once told him, the argument Ozai had with his father, the mysterious disappearance of Ursa the very night the old Fire Lord died. Shulian's expression darkened. \"Maybe... maybe he didn't want any of us around because he had done something foul.\" His wife froze. \"What you're saying is dangerous. It could be considered treason.\" Shulian nodded. \"Then let no word of this leave this room. Ozai... he's like a violent snake. He's always been that way.\" __________ The next day after the academy, something unexpected happened, Zuko sought out Tai Lung for the first time in nearly two years. The Crown Prince stood near the courtyard with a hesitant expression, his golden eyes flickering with uncertainty. He approached Tai Lung slowly and said, \"I want to challenge you to a spar.\" Tai Lung raised an eyebrow, noting the worried look in Zuko's eyes. Conveniently, one of the academy teachers was present nearby and overheard the request. \"If Tai Lung agrees,\" the teacher said aloud, \"then a spar between students is permitted.\" Tai Lung met Zuko's gaze for a moment longer, then nodded. \"Fine.\" The students quickly gathered in a circle, the teacher taking his place nearby as witness. The spar began with Zuko taking the initiative, launching a stream of flame at Tai Lung. Without hesitation, Tai Lung answered with a flame of equal strength. The two fires collided mid-air, bursting in sparks and smoke. In the next instant, Tai Lung dashed through the dispersing fire, emerging right in front of Zuko. Before the prince could react, Tai Lung's foot swept out in a kick, followed by a punch that sent Zuko crashing onto the ground. Tai Lung stood tall, calm, looking down at the groaning Zuko. He turned toward the teacher and said, \"It is my victory.\" Then, without waiting for further comment, he left the academy grounds and made his way home. He wondered briefly what had gotten into Zuko to challenge him out of nowhere, but the thought faded quickly. Whatever it was, it didn't seem worth worrying about. Later that evening, a group of royal guards arrived at their home. Their presence was heavy, stern. \"We are here to take Tai Lung Long into custody,\" the lead guard announced. \"For assaulting the Crown Prince.\" Admiral Lung's face darkened immediately. \"What are you talking about? Tai, what happened?\" Tai Lung recounted the events exactly as they occurred. The royal guards exchanged glances and nodded. \"Yes,\" one of them said, \"this matches the witness testimonies.\" The admiral narrowed his eyes. \"Then why are you here? It was a spar between students.\" The guard answered, \"Sir, Tai Lung used excessive force against the Crown Prince. He clearly had intention to harm the Crown Prince\" \"I did not,\" Tai Lung said firmly. \"There was a teacher there.\" \"The teacher confirmed that you used excessive force intentionally,\" the guard replied flatly. Tai Lung's expression hardened into a frown. Admiral Lung mirrored his son's frown, then sighed. \"Go with them, Tai. I'll go to the palace and get to the bottom of this. Trust me.\" At those words, Tai Lung froze for a moment. Something stirred in his memory, Shifu's betrayal, from his past life. He stared at his father, silent. The admiral placed a firm hand on his shoulder and repeated \"Trust me.\" Tai Lung nodded slowly. \"Very well.\" He didn't resist as they shackled him, guiding him away like a common criminal. The metal was cold and hard on his wrists, but he did not care. He wanted to see where this path led. They placed him in a dark prison cell with stone walls and a small barred window. No one spoke to him, save the guard who delivered tasteless food in silence. The meals reminded him far too much of the twenty years he spent imprisoned in his previous life. But Tai Lung said nothing. He sat in that cell for three days. On the second day of his imprisonment, a voice in the back of his head whispered to him that he was betrayed again. On the third day, the voice began screaming at him to break free, to crush anyone who dared to try stopping him. But he resisted it and stayed put, to wait for his father, he chose to keep his trust in his father. On the fourth day, the heavy door creaked open. His father stood there, looking worn and tired, pain etched into every line on his face. \"I'm sorry, Tai Lung,\" he said quietly. \"This is a plot from the Fire Lord. He wants to put you on trial and punish you unjustly.\" Tai Lung looked up, expression unreadable. \"This happened because of me,\" the admiral continued. \"He wanted me gone and this is how he chose to do it.\" \"What do you mean?\" Tai Lung asked. \"During the trial, plead guilty,\" his father said. \"I'll step down from my position as admiral as an apology to spare you. The Fire Lord will appear merciful while I take the fall.\" Tai Lung's frown deepened. \"If I do this, you'll lose your rank. That's what you've worked your whole life for. You were proud of it. It is your greatest pride\" The admiral gave a small smile. \"No, I'm proud of you, you are my greatest pride. And if this is the price I must pay to keep you safe, I would pay it ten times over. You are my son and I would never turn my back on you.\" He lowered his head. \"Remember what I said. Plead guilty and ask for forgiveness. Leave the rest to me.\" With that, the admiral left. Tai Lung sat in the silence of the cell, but his stillness was only on the surface. Inside, an old memory stirred inside him. Shifu lowering his head and turning his back, it was different circumstances, he knew it, but he couldn't help and recall the day of his rejection. His mind shifted to the look on his father, tired, troubled and guilty. A man willing to give away what he worked on his entire life, a man willing to ruin his good name. The voice in his head came louder than ever, it asked since when did he bow his head and plead guilty? When did he bring dishonor and shame to his father out of weakness and helplessness? A feeling he had almost forgotten after twelve years boiled in his veins, unfettered rage. He had honored his parents' wishes in this life. He had lived peacefully in this strange new world, he shackled his pride, focusing on the training and betterment of his technique, offering no challenge, causing no disturbance. He was humble in this life. But where did all of this lead to? Do they think he was a declawed kitten? That they can control him and treat him however they pleased. He was in the right all along, to be proud is not darkness, it shows you better than others. And to be humble is to be submissive and weak. His eyes narrowed, gleaming with restrained fury. If this world wished to treat him like that… then it would learn his name, just as the last one had. And they would never forget it. For he was Tai Lung, The Snow Leopard and Shifu's most destructive student.\n\nWith the end of the siege, it was expected that Admiral Lung would finally return home. But he didn't. Instead, a surprising order was issued by the new Fire Lord Ozai, the admiral was to lead a campaign in the northern seas, hunting down pirates and Water Tribe barbarians. Many were stunned.

The stillness around him was not one of defeat, but of patience, of a predator waiting for the right moment. Then came a soft shuffle of feet, followed by the unlocking of the cell door.

It had been four years since Lu Ten's death. Tai watched the man approach, silent as always. \"I'm sorry, Tai Lung,\" Iroh began gently, his voice warm yet worn. \"I tried speaking to my brother, but…\" He shook his head. \"I failed you.\" Tai Lung's eyes met his. \"It's fine. It was his decision, not yours.\" Then his voice softened slightly. \"When did you come back?\" Iroh let out a long breath. \"Just today. The moment I arrived, I heard about your imprisonment.\" He looked at Tai with guilt. \"It was because of me that you ended up here. And for that, I am truly sorry.\" There was a pause. Iroh looked downward and then said, \"Zuko… was forced into this. He's a good boy, but his father…\" He trailed off with another sigh. \"I understand,\" Tai said firmly. \"And I know what I need to do.\" Iroh gave a slow, sad nod. \"Then I won't stop you.\" He turned and left the cell, leaving Tai to the darkness. Tai sat in the silence, the chains around his wrists light compared to the weight of his wrath. He could break free anytime. He could've walked out from the start. But no, he now wanted this trial. He wanted this farce. He was waiting. ___________ The cell door finally opened again, this time to armed soldiers. They led him through stone corridors to the Fire Lord's Council chamber. Tai Lung walked with his head held high. He was not broken. He was not a prisoner. He was a predator closing on his prey. The massive double doors to the chamber opened, revealing rows of generals, admirals, ministers, and advisors. At one side sat Iroh and next to him, the admiral, Tai's father, face lined with anxiety. Across from them sat Azula, a cruel smirk tugging at her lips. Beside her, Zuko sat stiffly, eyes turned away, unable to meet Tai Lung's. The others bore different expressions, disdain, pity, indifference. But all eyes shifted upward, to the elevated throne, where a curtain of fire roared. Behind that wall of flame sat Fire Lord Ozai. Tai Lung entered full of confidence without fear. He stood tall, still as stone. A minister's voice rose in outrage. \"How dare you stand before the Fire Lord without kneeling?!\" Tai Lung ignored him completely. His eyes fixed on the wall of fire, on the man behind it. \"I'll keep this simple so even you can understand, Ozai,\" Tai spoke clearly, his voice echoing. \"I'm not playing along with this little game of yours. I challenge you to an Agni Kai.\" A sharp intake of breath echoed across the chamber. The entire room froze in stunned silence. Tai Lung continued, calm and unshaken, \"Since you don't have any honor, I don't mind helping you reclaim a sliver of it.\" Shock spread like wildfire. His father, Admiral Lung paled, his mouth opening in disbelief. Iroh's gaze darted toward his brother. The wall of fire before Ozai surged, burning higher and hotter in response to his fury. Iroh tried to speak. \"Brother, please…\" Ozai's voice cut through like a blade. \"You dare to challenge me to an Agni Kai?\" Tai Lung smirked. It was the kind of smile that taunted and belittled. \"Why not? You're just a backup pretending to be a Fire Lord. I don't see the problem in my words.\" The flames roared. Ozai rose to his feet, barely containing his rage. \"Child or not, you shall pay for your insolence!\" Tai Lung's voice turned sharp, full of disdain. \"No. You will be the one to suffer, you second place.\" The chamber erupted in murmurs and horror. To speak to the Fire Lord like that, to insult him, to challenge him was nothing short of a blasphemy. But by tradition, Ozai had no choice now. He had been challenged to an Agni Kai. If he refused, he would lose his honor before the entire court and possibly the entire nation. Tai Lung's voice rose. \"Let's do it in the heart of the capital. Let every citizen watch you. I want your humiliation to become a public spectacle.\" Ozai's voice boomed. \"You will pay for every word. I will reduce you to ash in front of the entire city!\" Tai Lung smiled wider, disdainful. He turned away. \"Then I'll see you at sunset.\" He walked toward the door. His father rose quickly and followed, his composure shattered. \"Tai…Tai! Wait!\" He couldn't believe it. His son had gone mad. Challenging the Fire Lord? In front of the council? There would be no trial now, only fire and death. Back in the chamber, the others exchanged looks of disbelief. Azula leaned toward Zuko and whispered with twisted amusement, \"He only had to lower his head. Now, we won't even have ashes left to lower into a grave.\" Zuko said nothing. His fists clenched at his sides. This was all his fault. His friend was going to die. And he couldn't do a thing to stop it. Iroh sat silently. His frown deepened into something grim. He didn't expect Tai Lung to defy the Fire Lord, let alone insult him and challenge him to an Agni Kai. The boy had burned every bridge, there would be no mercy now, not even if the entire council begged for it. ___________ The heavy stone halls echoed with footsteps as Tai Lung strode away from the council chamber. His expression hadn't changed since he left, focused, unreadable. But behind him, the sound of boots quickening told him he wasn't alone. \"Tai Lung!\" his father, the admiral, called as he caught up, grabbing him by the arm. \"What have you done? There's no way the Fire Lord will spare you now.\" Tai Lung stopped walking. \"You got it wrong,\" he said calmly. \"I'm not going to spare him. He crossed the line. And he's going to regret the day he did.\" The admiral's grip tightened, forcing Tai Lung to face him. His eyes were wide, frantic. \"You're talented, yes, but you're still too young. Do you even understand who you're challenging? The Fire Lord is a firebending grandmaster. In the entire Fire Nation, only Prince Iroh might stand a chance against him in a one-on-one fight!\" Tai Lung met his father's stare with unwavering calm. \"I've watched firebenders for years. Soldiers. Masters. I have learned what firebending grandmasters are capable of.\" His voice was low but steady. \"And I know for a fact that I am stronger than any member of the royal family. There is nothing divine or special about them, they just use slightly different forms compared to the rest of fire benders\" A shadow of despair crossed the admiral's face. When had his son grown so arrogant? When had confidence turned to such dangerous certainty? \"Even putting aside his firebending,\" the admiral said, his voice weakening, \"Ozai can bend lightning. Prince Iroh himself admitted Ozai was even better at it than he is.\" Tai Lung without a word, lifted one arm and opened his palm. Lightning cracked in his hand, arcing wildly, illuminating the corridor in an electric blue glow. The admiral's eyes widened in disbelief. Then Tai Lung raised his other hand. A flame burst forth, not the usual orange, but a fierce, shimmering blue. \"Father, I already mastered lighting,\" Tai Lung said, his tone still calm, still cold. \"And my fire is more powerful.\" His father stepped back in shock, unable to speak. Tai Lung looked him directly in the eyes, voice sharpening. \"And even without bending… I'm confident I still have a good chance of beating him.\" The admiral blinked. \"What?\" he whispered. \"Bending isn't really my greatest combat asset, and from what I observed, humans are relatively fragile\" Tai added. The admiral went numb. Lightning… blue fire… And yet Tai believed he was better at something else? The admiral couldn't understand what Tai Lung was referring to. He knew with son's talent, he would become one of the most powerful fire benders in their history, but now it was as if he were staring at someone who had ascended past the limits of what he thought possible. Tai Lung smiled faintly, the expression not warm but cold and predatory like a beast. \"Trust me,\" he said. \"I was trained to find weaknesses and make my enemy suffer for it. I will crush him, break him bone by bone and only then I will kill him. I will make you proud.\" But the smile didn't reassure his father. It chilled him. Something about It made him forget the worry he had earlier completely. His mind raced with one question, how could his son speak of killing the Fire Lord with such ease? And the look in his son's eyes was not normal to say the least, it burned with malice. The admiral exhaled deeply and composed himself. \"Even if you do win…\" he said slowly, \"don't kill him. Tai Lung, you're too young to cross that line.\" Tai Lung frowned slightly at the request, but saw the look in his father's eyes, not fear of Ozai, but fear of him. Tai Lung felt a pang of guilt seeing his father's eyes. With a sigh, he nodded. \"Fine. But I will still beat him. Badly.\" And with that, Tai Lung turned once more and walked ahead, not toward his execution, but toward a reckoning that would set the Fire Nation ablaze.\n\nTai Lung remained seated in the cold cell, unmoving and silent. He had not uttered a word since his father's visit. The stillness around him was not one of defeat, but of patience, of a predator waiting for the right moment. Then came a soft shuffle of feet, followed by the unlocking of the cell door.\n\nTai Lung remained seated in the cold cell, unmoving and silent. He had not uttered a word since his father's visit.

I will crush him, break him bone by bone and only then I will kill him. I will make you proud.\"\n\nTai Lung smiled faintly, the expression not warm but cold and predatory like a beast. \"Trust me,\" he said. \"I was trained to find weaknesses and make my enemy suffer for it.

            "content": "The news spread through the Fire Nation Capital like wildfire, just as Ozai intended. He made certain that every citizen, every noble, every soldier knew about the treacherous son of Admiral Lung, a mere child who dared strike the Crown Prince, insult the Fire Lord within his own council, and top it all by challenging him to an Agni Kai. The Fire Lord wanted this humiliation carved into the memory of the nation. Let them see the price of rebellion. Let them witness what happened when a boy refused to bow. He wouldn't just destroy Tai Lung. He would disgrace his name, tarnish the legacy of his family, and break their pride. The center of the capital was flooded by the time the sun neared the horizon. A massive dueling ring had been prepared open, spacious, and surrounded by tiers of seated citizens. Most had come for blood. They expected to see the Fire Lord burn the arrogant noble's son to ash. The boy had overstepped every line imaginable, and now only death could atone for his sins. Yet, in the crowd, scattered among the eager and bloodthirsty, were those who didn't cheer. Among them stood a woman with tear-reddened eyes, Tai Lung's mother, trembling but proud of her son's bravery. In some other section, sat Ty Lee and Mai, their faces grim and anxious. Not far off, Zuko stood silently, his jaw clenched, guilt written plainly across his face. Iroh beside him looked down, ashamed, the weight of inaction and guilt painted on his face. The boy chose to stand up instead of accepting injustice. Admiral Lung stood still. His eyes were fixed on the ring, his face tight with concern. Yet, beneath that surface, a glimmer of hope flickered. He remembered Tai Lung's words. That presence. That eerie chill. His instincts screamed that his son was no ordinary boy, there was something dangerous within him. Something he didn't feel before. And then, the duelists stepped forward. The sun was just brushing against the edge of the horizon as the combatants entered the ring. A heavy silence fell across the crowd. Both wore the traditional ceremonial shoulder garments of the Agni Kai, crimson, gold, and black, symbolizing the honor of battle. They knelt on opposite ends of the ring, bowing their heads in silence. Then, as one, they stood. With a smooth motion, they pulled off their shoulder garments and cast them aside. Tai Lung stood tall, taller than what a twelve-year-old should be. His body, though still in the early stages of youth, bore the signs of intense training. Defined muscles beneath his skin like tempered steel. But it was his eyes, sharp, golden, and glowing with power that stunned the crowd. Murmurs rippled. He was… impressive. Clearly talented and well trained. Some even began to pity him. Such a gifted boy. He could have been a war hero… a symbol of pride. Instead, he would die here, beneath the Fire Lord's flame. On the other end, stood Fire Lord Ozai. Tall. Broad. Radiating dominance. His every breath carried authority, his gaze burned like molten metal. He was a firebending grandmaster, the embodiment of power itself. The very air bowed around him. The difference between the two was staggering. It felt wrong for an Agni Kai to take place between them. It wasn't a duel. It was an execution. But Tai Lung's gaze didn't falter. He didn't even blink. While his size was a disadvantage, Tai Lung's mastery of chi control compensated more than enough. The techniques he honed and carried from his last life gave him speed and strength far beyond what any child or even adult should possess. A discipline that no firebender had ever imagined. He took his stance. And it wasn't a firebending stance. It was his Kung Fu. The crowd tilted forward, confused. Ozai narrowed his eyes and scoffed. \"What foolishness is this? A mixed stance of earth and waterbending?\" He sneered. \"Which fool taught you that nonsense?\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed dangerously at the words. He had learned this in the Jade Palace. From Master Shifu, the only father he truly knew in that life. And though bitterness still clung to his memories of Shifu, he would allow no insult, not even an ignorant one. \"You'll know soon enough who the fool is,\" Tai Lung said coldly. Ozai's gaze sharpened. Then, with a roar, he punched forward, a torrent of searing flame erupting toward Tai Lung. Tai Lung moved. Not with panic. Not with effort. With grace. He sidestepped the wave of flame, only a lick of fire brushing past his shoulder. Ozai's eyes narrowed. \"So you're the slippery type,\" he muttered, then struck again, a wider arc of flame rushing out like a wall. Tai Lung walked, a dance more than a dodge. With each step, he grew closer. Each movement is smooth, refined, and unknowingly to any, a predator approaching his prey. The crowd watched tensely in silence. The boy wasn't just surviving. He was approaching the Fire Lord steadily. As Tai Lung closed the distance between himself and his opponent, the crowd collectively held its breath. Ozai's eyes narrowed. The Fire Lord's leg suddenly swept outward in a wide, arcing kick, unleashing a blazing wall of fire. At such close range, escape should have been impossible. But Tai Lung vanished. With a burst of speed so sudden, Tai Lung slid low beneath the fire, his body grazing the ground like smoke. In the same fluid motion, his leg snapped upward, striking Ozai's planted foot. The Fire Lord's balance shattered. He staggered, his eyes flaring wide with surprise before hardening with fury. As he fell, Ozai slammed a hand to the ground to break his descent, his other leg igniting as it shot toward Tai Lung in a blazing arc. Flame exploded where Tai Lung had been. But he wasn't there. He was above. In that instant, Ozai looked up, only to see a foot descending from the sky. CRACK! Tai Lung's foot slammed into his face, crushing his head into the stone. The audience gasped. Supporting his weight on one hand, Tai Lung flipped again, rising with grace and power, his second foot dropping like a hammer on the fallen Fire Lord's chest with a thud that echoed across the courtyard. Ozai lay beaten, his body pinned. And Tai Lung stood tall. His foot pressed firmly against the Fire Lord's chest. \"How does the ground feel like?\" Tai Lung asked, his voice calm and sharp. \"It's quite suitable for you… don't you think?\" The crowd was dead silent. They couldn't believe what they were seeing. Ozai's eyes shot open, filled with unfiltered rage. Power surged around him, an eruption of fire in all directions. Tai Lung jumped back, flipping cleanly as fire engulfed the ring. Ozai rose, his expression twisted in fury. \"You will pay for this!\" Tai Lung chuckled \"Who's going to make me pay? You? The backup Fire Lord who frames others?\" Ozai roared. With a savage punch, he sent another massive wave of fire forward. Tai Lung sidestepped effortlessly and moved in, faster than before. But Ozai was ready this time, his stance firm, his body braced for the counter. Then it happened. Pain. Blow after blow rained down on Ozai, his face, ribs, joints, each blow carried strength no child should possess. Tai Lung became a blur, rotating, spinning, his fists, elbows, knees landing in a merciless rhythm. It was like a storm of violence. Ozai's body jerked and twisted under the torrent, his body crumbling with each strike. The crowd watched, mouths agape. They had never witnessed an Agni Kai like this. This was not how Agni Kai fought. Agni Kai is a duel of fire, not whatever this is. But more importantly, the child was winning. Dominating, without using even a flicker of flame. Ty Lee's eyes lit up. She turned to Mai, gripping her sleeve. \"These movements... they're the same ones he has been teaching me!\" Mai only nodded slowly, unable to tear her gaze from the spectacle. Ozai stumbled back, dazed, blood at the corner of his mouth. Tai Lung caught him by the beard. The Fire Lord glared at him, hatred burning hotter than his flames. Tai Lung responded with a cool smile, then punched him straight in the face. Ozai collapsed. And his beard tore free in Tai Lung's hand. Tai Lung stood over him, holding the severed tuft of regal hair. He looked at it briefly… then, with a flick of his fingers, ignited it in flame. The burning hair crackled as it turned to ash. Ozai staggered to his feet, barely. \"I am the Fire Lord,\" he snarled, his voice trembling with pride and desperation. \"And you are just a child! I will not lose to you! I was born with divine right!\" Tai Lung didn't reply. He stood still, watching the man. Those words... that tone... they echoed in his mind. He remembered Po. He remembered the contempt in his own voice, his own arrogance, when he dismissed the panda as unworthy. When he believed himself to be the Dragon Warrior, when he wanted to prove himself. [Did I look this pathetic then? No… Absolutely not] he thought. Ozai screamed and dashed forward with reckless fury, aiming a fiery kick at Tai Lung's head. Tai Lung tilted, the kick missing by a hair. Then snap, a sharp, surgical kick struck Ozai's leg, precisely at the nerves and chi pathways. Ozai crumpled, falling to his knee. \"I struck your nerves and chi paths,\" Tai Lung said, his voice cold. \"You won't be able to use that leg for hours.\" He looked down at the broken ruler before him. \"You've lost this Agni Kai. Luckily for you… I agreed not to kill you.\" With that, Tai Lung turned his back. He didn't want to look at Ozai anymore. The Fire Lord's act, his words, his pride, they were too familiar. Too close to how he acted in his past life. He had given Ozai a beating, stripped him of dignity, and left him in the dirt. That was enough. He didn't want to be reminded of his failure, he dreaded the thought that he was as pathetic as Ozai. No, he rejected the thought.\n\nThe news spread through the Fire Nation Capital like wildfire, just as Ozai intended. He made certain that every citizen, every noble, every soldier knew about the treacherous son of Admiral Lung, a mere child who dared strike the Crown Prince, insult the Fire Lord within his own council, and top it all by challenging him to an Agni Kai. The Fire Lord wanted this humiliation carved into the memory of the nation. Let them see the price of rebellion. Let them witness what happened when a boy refused to bow.\n\nThe news spread through the Fire Nation Capital like wildfire, just as Ozai intended.

            "content": "Ozai remained on one knee, broken and defeated, but not humbled. Pride roared in his veins like wildfire, drowning out reason and mercy. He stared at the back of the boy who had humiliated him before the entire nation. The boy who walked away as if the duel was already done. It wasn't. With a quick movement and a snarl on his lips, Ozai summoned a bolt of lightning. From his kneeling position, he hurled it straight at Tai Lung's unguarded back. The audience gasped in horror. Time seemed to slow. The lightning surged through the air, violent, pure, deadly. Tai Lung turned in a flash. His eyes widened at the sight. He raised his hand and caught the lightning. It struck him dead-on, electricity crackling across his form. His feet dragged across the ground as he was pushed back, sparks dancing around his body. He clenched his jaw in pain and fury, his muscles tightening as he redirected the current, channeling the lightning through his chi paths with terrifying control. His eyes locked with Ozai's. Without a word, Tai Lung pointed his fingers forward. The same bolt of lightning exploded from his fingertips, twice as fierce. Ozai's eyes widened in fear. He raised both arms and blasted fire in defense. The redirected lightning met it mid-air and exploded in a deafening burst of flame and light. The shockwave hurled Ozai backward like a ragdoll, smoke rising from his limbs as he hit the ground hard, groaning in pain. He struggled to rise, shaking, pathetic. Tai Lung's voice echoed across the silent ring. \"I gave you a chance to walk out of this,\" he said, each word a blade. \"Since you don't appreciate it… I'll make sure you remember this day for the rest of your life.\" He raised his hand again. This time, a pale blue flame danced into existence. The audience murmured in disbelief, blue fire, hotter than any they'd seen. Ozai's eyes widened in terror as the flame swelled. Tai Lung pointed his palm forward, and a torrent of blue fire erupted toward the Fire Lord. It surged like a tidal wave, devouring the air with heat. Ozai pushed himself up to his knee, gathering every ounce of strength to counter. A massive orange inferno exploded from his hands to meet it. The two flames collided with a roar. Blue and orange struggled for dominance, but the blue fire quickly surged ahead, larger, hotter, superior in every way. It swallowed Ozai's flame and kept advancing. Then came the scream. The crowd flinched, some turning their heads as the Fire Lord's cry of pain rang out. The flame washed over him like judgment, scorching him mercilessly. When the fire finally dissipated, Ozai lay crumpled on the ground, his arms charred, his breathing ragged. And Tai Lung stood above him, untouched. His voice boomed with power and pride. \"I am Tai Lung, son of Admiral Lung. This time, I fought and spared you in an Agni Kai. The next time you do something like this…\" His eyes glinted with malice. \"I will come to the palace and forcefully change the ruling family.\" He lowered his hand. \"You have been warned.\" Without another glance at the broken Fire Lord, Tai Lung turned and walked away. Soldiers and healers rushed to Ozai's side, but not a single person moved to stop Tai Lung. Not a whisper of protest escaped the crowd. Every eye followed him as he strode from the ring, his back straight, his presence towering despite his small frame. A twelve-year-old boy had brought the Fire Lord to his knees, a grandmaster, without bending fire. They had seen him redirect lightning, wield blue flame, and mark the nation's ruler with his flames. And as his final words echoed in their minds, one truth settled in every heart, Tai Lung had not even reached his prime, far from it. And still, he showed today that he was among the strongest if not the strongest fire bender. ___________ The moment Tai Lung stepped away from the ring, the stunned crowd recovered and began murmuring behind him, he spotted two familiar figures rushing after him, his parents. Admiral Lung and his wife hurried toward him. Relief filled their eyes, but pride burned even brighter. Tai Lung met their gaze with a small, confident smile. \"I told you this would be the outcome,\" Tai Lung said, voice calm and certain. Admiral Lung laughed, his deep voice rumbling in the air with clear pride. \"You surpassed even my wildest imagination. You didn't just win, you crushed the Fire Lord\" His mother wasted no time, wrapping her arms tightly around her son, her voice trembling. \"Don't ever do something like this again,\" she said, burying her face into his shoulder. Tai Lung smirked and tilted his head toward the ring's direction. \"Say that to the fire rooster laying flat in the ring.\" His parents blinked. Speechless. Since when did their obedient, well-mannered son talk like that? As if reading their thoughts, Tai Lung crossed his arms. \"I acted nice this whole time, but that just made some idiots think they could walk all over me. I'm done playing nice.\" Admiral Lung's expression shifted, becoming more serious as he studied his son. After a long moment, he placed a firm hand on Tai Lung's shoulder. \"It's okay to show your strength, Tai. But don't ever use it to oppress others. There is no honor in bullying the weak.\" Tai Lung paused, then nodded without hesitation. \"I understand,\" he said, and he meant it. Just like he was the son and student of Shifu, he was also the son of Admiral Lung. He had no intention of repeating past mistakes and dishonoring his father. His thoughts briefly wandered to Ozai's final outburst, the pride, the desperation, the fall. [No, I was never like that. I will never be, I am Tai Lung.] Tai Lung thought. \"Tai Lung!\" The cheery voice cut through the air, and the family of three turned. Ty Lee bounded toward them, dragging a reluctant Mai behind her. Her eyes sparkled as she reached them. \"That was amazing! A little too scary… but amazing! You took down the Fire Lord! You're the best firebender in the entire Fire Nation now!\" Mai gave Ty Lee a dry look before glancing at Tai Lung. \"You didn't die… hooray,\" she said, her voice flat and unimpressed. Tai Lung blinked, then let out a quiet chuckle. There was something oddly amusing about how doom and gloom Mai could be. Ty Lee has once said that about her and her words were right on the mark. ___________ Back in the royal palace, the atmosphere was somber. Iroh sat quietly with his nephew and niece, both of whom were still visibly shaken. The duel had rattled more than just the audience, it had cracked the foundation of what they believed to be true. Azula sat rigid, her expression unreadable, but the fire burning behind her golden eyes betrayed her fury. She had always believed her father was unbeatable, a titan among men. But now? He had been broken. Defeated. Humiliated. And worst of all by Tai Lung. A boy the same age as her brother. A boy she loathed. \"He must have cheated,\" Azula hissed. \"There's no way he won in a fair fight.\" Zuko said nothing. His eyes were cast downward, lost in thought. Iroh, however, was focused. His memory returned to that moment when Tai Lung had redirected lightning. [He was caught off guard by Ozai's lighting] Iroh mused. [No stance. No preparation. But he held it… and sent it back with more power.] Iroh had created the redirection technique just recently, after years of practicing and observing other benders and culture. But even he couldn't do what Tai Lung did, not in that position. He looked at Azula, sadness in his eyes for Azula's state. \"Tai Lung is the most talented child I have ever seen. From the first time I met him, I knew he was destined to become a great firebender, one of the greatest in our history. I knew he would grow fast… but not to this degree.\" Azula's fists clenched tighter. She was supposed to be the prodigy. She was the one born to greatness. Her thoughts churned, refusing to accept defeat. Her mind clung to the image of Tai Lung's blue flames, the lightning he redirected. If he could do it, so could she. She'd master it. Surpass it. She would show everyone who the strongest bender truly was. ___________ The Agni Kai had ended, but its aftermath roared louder than any flame ever could. In the days that followed, the Fire Nation found itself shaken to its very core by a single duel that had shattered the once unshakable image of its ruling family. The royal court, once revered as the pinnacle of firebending might and imperial prestige, now stood humiliated before the eyes of its own people. And at the center of that humiliation was Fire Lord Ozai. The whispers started quietly but spread like wildfire through the capital: 'He called him the backup lord.' The words Tai Lung had spoken before delivering the most decisive defeat of Ozai's reign. A mocking title delivered with certainty, followed by a display of skill and power that made even seasoned benders feel like rookies. Now, for the first time, people were questioning everything. 'Was Ozai ever the rightful choice to be Fire Lord?' 'Had Iroh, despite his siege failure, been the more capable brother?' The questions grew bolder each day, and no one in the palace dared to speak them aloud, but everyone was thinking them. Worse still was the lightning. Even the Agni Kai's brutal outcome might have faded with time but not that. Not the image of Fire Lord Ozai, already on his knee, conjuring lightning and aiming it at Tai Lung's back. A move devoid of honor, stripped of dignity. A coward's strike, in full view of the entire city. And for what? The lightning had not only been blocked or dodge, but miraculously redirected, and thrown back with merciless accuracy. Now the Fire Lord lay in recovery, his arms scorched, his pride seared even deeper. His cries of pain still echoed in the halls, and no one, not even the royal guards, dared speak of it with anything but hushed voices. It was a shame that would never be forgotten. But as one figure fell from grace, another rose like a comet blazing through the sky. Tai Lung, the name was on everyone's lips. The son of Admiral Lung, a man already revered in the military, now found his family legacy cemented in history. The rumors spread like smoke 'The Fire Lord intended to humiliate an admiral through his son, then strip his powers and rank from him. It was a political move gone terribly wrong.' Instead, the opposite happened. The respectful, polite boy from the Royal Academy, the one who had never stirred trouble, never sought attention, had revealed himself to be a talent unlike any seen in generations. He was not just a raising skilled firebender. But a prodigy. A powerhouse despite his young age. The Fire Nation didn't just witness a fight that day, they witnessed a shift in the tide of power. In the hearts of many, the royal family's fire had dimmed. And in its place, a new flame had risen.\n\nOzai remained on one knee, broken and defeated, but not humbled. Pride roared in his veins like wildfire, drowning out reason and mercy. He stared at the back of the boy who had humiliated him before the entire nation.

            "content": "Tai Lung sat in the warm familiarity of his family's home, the subtle scent of incense from a nearby brazier filling the quiet room. He looked across the table at his parents. Both wore serious expressions. The initial happiness of seeing their son return unharmed from his confrontation with the Fire Lord had faded, and as they calmed down, the reality of their situation had settled in. Admiral Lung spoke first, his voice firm but fatherly. \"After your Agni Kai, it's clear to everyone, you're no longer a boy. You've stepped into manhood. Which means it's time you set a goal for yourself, a path. You've proven your strength and skill. Now, you must decide what you'll do with it.\" At the word goal, Tai Lung's mind drifted. In his past life, everything had been about bringing his father pride by becoming the Dragon Warrior. That singular objective had driven his every decision, training, fighting, defying Oogway's decision, even attacking innocents. It had been a blind pursuit, but it was a purpose. It gave him direction. Now… he had nothing. He trained because it was all he knew, fought because it was what he was made for. He told himself it was to regain strength, to master bending and learn new techniques, to stand at the top of this world, but deep down, he knew it was just motion. There was no true destination, no final goal calling to him. And now, he knew he probably already reached or close to the top. He blinked slowly, returning his gaze to the brazier's flame. A faint frustration stirred inside him. Seeing his son silent, Admiral Lung spoke again \"For someone who studied at the Royal Academy and demonstrated such advanced combat skill, it's expected you'll join the army. Of course…\" He glanced at his wife, then back at his son. \"If you don't feel ready for war, you can stay here a little longer.\" Tai Lung stared silently at his parents as he thought deeply about what he should be doing next. When he finally spoke, it was with calm, at least in tone, not in heart. \"I don't wish to participate in war, war and the honor that comes from it is not my calling\" he said plainly. \"I don't know what is my purpose or what is my future, but for the time being, I would like to travel the world. Explore it. Challenge benders and masters across it.\" He decided to follow the path of masters in his past life, to travel the world and search for answers, it was the only path he knew and approved of. There was no surprise in his parents' faces. They believed they knew their son better than he knew himself, his obsession with training, his hunger to improve. It was only natural that he would desire to test himself against worthy opponents across the world. His mother gave a small smile of understanding, while the admiral chuckled, shaking his head. \"I expected a response like that,\" Admiral Lung said. \"So how about this: you join the army under my fleet. You'll start as a captain, with a ship under your command. That way, you can travel freely. Explore. Move wherever you want.\" Tai Lung raised a brow. \"Is that even allowed? That's a clear abuse of your position.\" The admiral smirked knowingly. \"All the children of nobles start as Lieutenants or Captains. And no one of them have one tenth of your skill, let alone your accomplishment of defeating the Fire Lord.\" His tone grew sharper, tempered with pride. \"You earned more than any title I could give.\" Tai Lung gave a light nod of acknowledgment. He didn't care for ranks, but he understood their function in the world. The admiral continued, his voice growing heavier with responsibility. \"Of course, you'll still need to participate in skirmishes and large-scale battles near you. It would be a great dishonor to ignore the war effort entirely.\" He looked at his son seriously. \"Our nation... it's not kind to power without duty. And most importantly, I don't want to hear that you are abusing your power in oppressing others.\" Tai Lung nodded again, this time more slowly. He didn't like the thought of war, of fighting for reasons beyond personal growth, but he understood. In the Fire Nation, power and obligation were inseparable. All capable combatants served. To refuse was to dishonor not only oneself, but one's lineage. As for oppressing others, he doesn't wish to repeat the past, to harm innocents and the helpless like he did in the valley of the peace. A small, bittersweet smile appeared on Admiral Lung's face. \"You'll have a ship waiting for you in three days.\" After Tai Lung left the room, Tai Lung's mother, who remained silent the whole time, finally spoke to her husband, concern etching her voice. \"Isn't that too fast?\" Admiral Lung let out a soft sigh. \"The faster the better. Tai's performance may have deterred most, but some fools will still try to test him. That day, I saw a side of Tai I have never known, a side full of pride, brutality and malice. I have no doubt that Tai intended to execute Ozai publicly and my request is the only thing that stopped him. That malevolent side could come out at any moment if he is antagonized againt…. I don't want to see my son bearing the blood of our own people on his hands. I hope as he grows up, he will learn how to restrain himself.\" It wasn't just concern for Tai Lung's safety. The admiral had seen enough to know that if anyone did try to provoke his son, they wouldn't survive the outcome. Not when even the Fire Lord had been crushed under Tai Lung's flame. In his eyes, it wasn't Tai Lung who needed protecting from the Fire Lord's supporters. It was the Fire Lord's supporters that needed protection from him. In truth, the admiral didn't mind his son killing enemies, it was part of the process of becoming a great man, but killing their own people for internal conflict, something the admiral didn't approve of. ___________ Three days later, the harbor was humming with life as ships bobbed gently along the Fire Nation docks. Standing at the edge of the stone pier, Tai Lung stared silently at the ship before him, a sleek vessel marked with the fire nation flags, befitting a captain under Admiral Lung's fleet. True to his word, his father had prepared everything: a ship, a capable crew, and a future set adrift on open seas. Behind him stood his parents. His father's posture was steady as ever, arms folded behind his back. His mother, however, struggled to maintain her composure, eyes shimmering with unshed tears as she gazed at her son's back. Tai Lung turned toward her, his expression gentle. \"Don't worry, Mom. You've seen how strong I am. I'll be fine.\" A soft sob escaped her lips as she stepped forward. \"I know,\" she whispered, wiping at her eyes. \"I'm just... sad to see you go. This is the first time you're leaving like this.\" Tai's lips lifted into a soft smile. \"I'll come back to visit. And I'll always write to you.\" His mother gave a small, teary nod while Admiral Lung placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"If only I could take you under my wing and travel with you,\" the admiral said with a deep sigh. \"But I have to stay here in the Fire Nation.\" Tai Lung looked at him, puzzled. \"Why not come with me? The three of us, together.\" The admiral shook his head. \"You're officially an enemy of the Fire Lord now. I have to remain on his council, keep watch. If he tries something... I need to be there.\" Tai Lung nodded slowly, the reality sinking in. \"Thank you, Father.\" The admiral laughed, warm and proud. \"It's a father's duty to stand by his children, to help them chase their dreams and fulfill their destiny. Besides, he went after you because of me. The least I can do is stand against the fire.\" Tai Lung smiled, truly smiled. \"Father. Mother. Thank you. Truly.\" Both parents returned the smile, their expressions a mix of pride and sorrow. Just as Tai Lung turned to ascend the gangplank, a voice rang out, calling his name. He stopped, glancing over his shoulder to see two familiar figures approaching: Ty Lee, waving frantically, and Mai trailing behind, arms crossed and eyes half-lidded as always. \"Tai!\" Ty Lee cried. \"We came by and your servants said you're leaving to join the war. How could you leave without telling us?\" Mai added dryly, \"I'm fine with that.\" Tai Lung tilted his head. \"It was abrupt. And it's not that big of a deal.\" \"Not that big of a deal?!\" Ty Lee's voice cracked. \"We're your friends! We should know when you're leaving our nation!\" Mai offered another unbothered shrug. \"Not really. I don't care.\" Tai Lung chuckled faintly. \"Well, now you know. Keep up your training. You've got great talent.\" Ty Lee was quiet for a moment, then suddenly pulled Tai Lung into a tight hug. \"Stay safe,\" she said, her voice muffled against his shoulder. \"We'll miss you.\" \"I won't,\" Mai said instantly. As Ty Lee let go, Tai Lung offered one final smile. \"Bye, Ty Lee. And you too, Mai.\" Ty Lee's face was downcast as she watched him board the ship. Mai, as usual, appeared uninterested, but after a pause, she turned to her friend and said, \"He'll be fine. Even the Fire Lord couldn't beat him.\" Ty Lee nodded, though her eyes lingered on the departing ship, sadness still written across her face. Tai Lung had been the only one who shared her love for acrobatics, the only one who could match her spirit in motion. Now, that connection was sailing away. Behind the girls, Tai Lung's mother stood silently, wearing the same look of sadness. A mother's ache. But beside her, Admiral Lung stood tall and proud, watching his son embark on the next chapter of his journey, with the pride of a father whose child had already surpassed every expectation. ___________ The waves lapped steadily against the hull as the ship cut through the water, leaving the Fire Nation behind in its wake. Tai Lung stood at the bow, arms folded, watching the coastline slowly shrink into the horizon. It was a strange feeling, he didn't belong there, but now that he is leaving and for the first time he felt some lingering emotion toward that land. He breathed in the salty air and turned around to observe the ship and its crew. Some sailors were cleaning, others chatting and some shouting commands across the deck. Among them stood a middle-aged man with weathered skin, sharp eyes, and a solid build, an unmistakable air of experience about him. The man approached Tai Lung with a confident stride and offered a respectful nod. \"Captain Tai Lung,\" the man said, voice steady. \"I'm Vice-Captain Han. Admiral Lung assigned me as your second-in-command and advisor. I'll be at your side on this journey.\" Tai Lung returned the nod. \"Thank you for coming with me.\" Han let out a hearty chuckle. \"I'm honored to follow the Admiral's orders. Besides, from everything I've heard and seen a few days ago, you're meant for greatness.\" He gave a sideways grin before adding, \"And, truthfully, I wouldn't mind a little break from war myself.\" Tai Lung allowed himself a small smile. There was something grounding about Han's presence, a steady flame that didn't seek to overwhelm or test him, just to guide. \"So, Captain,\" Han said as he folded his arms and looked out toward the open sea, \"where do we go now? Any destination in mind?\" Tai Lung shook his head slowly. \"I don't know much about the world outside the Fire Nation,\" he admitted. \"I'll follow your lead.\" Han smirked, a glint of mischief and pride in his eyes. \"The Admiral already told me plenty about you. Trust me, Captain, you won't regret following my lead.\" The wind caught the sails, and the ship surged forward with purpose. For the first time in his life, Tai Lung wasn't moving toward a certain goal or an expectation, he was moving into the unknown, seeking to find his goal and purpose in this world.\n\nTai Lung sat in the warm familiarity of his family's home, the subtle scent of incense from a nearby brazier filling the quiet room. He looked across the table at his parents. Both wore serious expressions. The initial happiness of seeing their son return unharmed from his confrontation with the Fire Lord had faded, and as they calmed down, the reality of their situation had settled in.\n\nTai Lung sat in the warm familiarity of his family's home, the subtle scent of incense from a nearby brazier filling the quiet room.

You've stepped into manhood. Which means it's time you set a goal for yourself, a path. You've proven your strength and skill. Now, you must decide what you'll do with it.\"\n\nAdmiral Lung spoke first, his voice firm but fatherly. \"After your Agni Kai, it's clear to everyone, you're no longer a boy.

            "content": "The first landfall after departing the Fire Nation was quiet. Tai Lung stood at the edge of the deck, arms folded as the ship slowly glided into a modest harbor. Before him stretched Yanhai Coastal Village, a humble coastal settlement nestled against the cliffs of the Earth Kingdom's shore. The green earth rolled behind the buildings, simple structures made of wood and clay, weathered by time and hardship. Vice-Captain Han stepped beside him, hands behind his back. \"Yanhai Coastal Village,\" he said. \"One of the first Earth Kingdom villages placed under Fire Nation control, about a hundred years ago. We'll be staying here for a day to rest and resupply before setting sail to the east.\" Tai Lung nodded silently, his gaze scanning the settlement. There was no smoke, no noise. Just a heavy stillness in the air, like a village holding its breath. \"I'll go explore the place,\" Tai Lung said. Han gave a brief nod and turned, barking a few orders at the crew to begin the resupply effort. With that arranged, he followed Tai Lung down the gangplank and onto the dock, the two walking side-by-side into the heart of the village. The moment they stepped into the streets, eyes turned to them. The villagers looked with a mix of wariness, fear, and bitterness. Their faces were tired, clothes worn thin. Children hid behind doorways; old men lowered their gaze. The air was thick with silent accusations and unspoken resentment. Tai Lung's golden eyes drifted over them. For a village supposedly benefiting from open Fire Nation trade, it looked hollow, stripped bare. He turned to Han. \"What is the treatment of the villages under our control?\" Tai Lung asked. \"How far are we from the baseline we set for ourselves at the Academy?\" Han sighed, the humor gone from his tone. \"Some villages are doing well,\" he admitted. \"But most are like this. Controlled, suppressed. The soldiers run them, and most see these people as lesser. It's… common.\" Tai Lung frowned. \"And what do you think?\" Han shrugged, unbothered. \"Honestly? I wouldn't harm them. But I wouldn't help them either. I don't care much about them.\" Tai Lung's eyes turned back to the villagers. He remembered the village in the valley of peace from his past life, places he once terrorized after he was denied the Dragon Scroll, when he was betrayed by his father. Though he'd never killed anyone, the fear he'd caused, the destruction he wrought upon the villagers, the way he turned back on the teachings of the Jade Palace, had been enough to earn his chains. And yet here, the same cruelty, or worse, was being enacted by soldiers who called themselves honorable, and no one was punishing them. His feet moved through the dust, thoughts spiraling, when he turned a corner and stopped. A child stood ahead, drawing aimlessly into the dirt with a stick, completely absorbed in his own world. Tai Lung was about to walk around him when, from a nearby hut, a woman bolted forward. In a single motion, she scooped up the child and dropped to her knees, trembling. \"Sir!\" she cried out, voice cracking. \"He is but a child! He didn't see you coming!\" Tai Lung blinked, stunned. Her fear was absolute, and it was directed at him. It was excessive, terribly so. He looked at her, at the shaking bundle she cradled, and a pit opened in his stomach. Something was deeply wrong here. \"It's fine,\" Tai Lung said, his voice level. He stepped around the woman and kept walking, Han silently following behind. A few steps later, Han tilted his head toward him. \"Didn't you find her reaction a little… strange?\" Tai Lung didn't turn. \"Your words, and the villagers' eyes, are enough of a telltale.\" Han studied him for a moment. \"I thought you'd want to correct the injustice,\" he said at last. \"You wouldn't be the first. Many noble sons come here thinking they can fix things. They eventually give up and many become like the others and start to relish in the villagers' suffering. Most of our people simply don't know restrain and see these people as lessers\" Tai Lung stopped, looking ahead at the cracked walls, the tired faces. \"I don't think I'm the right person to fix this,\" he said quietly. \"I'm not a good person.\" His thoughts went to the past. Of houses he'd smashed. Of Shops and carts he ruined. Villagers he'd scared into fleeing the valley. He'd wanted power. Wanted to prove he deserved it. Wanted to achieve the only destiny he ever knew. In his quest, he had harmed the innocent and he knew if their lives were the price of his destiny, his claws would have snuffed them. No. He wasn't the one to bring justice. He was not worthy. They continued walking through the village, the sound of the wind blowing dust across worn streets. Tai Lung said nothing more, and Han didn't press. The silence between them was heavy, but understood. ___________ The morning sun had barely climbed above the horizon when the ship's crew began preparations to set sail. Ropes were tightened, supplies stored, and sails unfolded under the commands of Vice-Captain Han. Tai Lung stood near the ship, his gaze fixed on his crew carrying orders. Then came the noise. Shouts and a clamor broke the stillness, echoing from the village center. Tai Lung turned sharply, ears narrowing in on the chaos. Without a word, he started walking toward the disturbance, the rest of the crew pausing their tasks to follow him out of curiosity or concern. They arrived to find a crowd gathered in a loose circle. At its heart, a man lay burnt and crumpled on the dirt, tears streaking his ash-covered face as he bowed low before a group of Fire Nation soldiers. \"Please!\" the man begged. \"Please, she's my wife! I'll do anything, just let her go!\" His wife, a woman of fragile frame and weary eyes, was held between two soldiers gripping her arms tightly. She struggled, but they laughed. The leader of the group stood in front, smirking with cruel amusement. \"It's your honor that your wife caught our attention,\" he said mockingly. \"And yet you dare to deny our favor?\" His voice dripped with mockery, and his companions snickered. Tai Lung remained at the edge of the crowd, watching silently. Seeing the man and his wife, Tai Lung's thoughts slipped unexpectedly to his parents in this life. At the start, he hadn't cared about them. Gratitude was the closest emotion he had felt. But with time, that gratitude grew into something deeper. Appreciation. Respect. Even affection. They reminded him of Shifu in some strange way, stern, proud, and even more supportive than his old adoptive father had been. His mind wandered further, back to the teachings of the Jade Palace: justice, honor, courage; virtues carved into his bones as a child, just as the darkness Oogway spoke of. He had forsaken justice when he terrorized innocent villagers in pursuit of his destiny. He had forsaken honor when he struck his own teacher, his father. And now, watching injustice unfold again before his eyes, doing nothing… he felt the edges of his courage slip, shamed into silence. He closed his eyes. Even in this life, he had been taught the same virtues again, by tutors chosen by his mother, by instructors at the academy, by his father's reminders before setting sail. All of them, in their own way, had echoed the teachings of the Jade Palace. All of them had spoken of honor and courage just like Shifu . Tai Lung drew a breath. He had no right to preach these virtues. Not after what he had done. He had lost that privilege. But maybe… he could still act on them, enforce them. [If nothing else], he thought, [I won't dishonor them. Not this family. Not again. I don't want to repeat my life all over again.] His eyes opened, golden and clear. Without a word, he stepped forward. Through the ring of villagers and past the surprised eyes of the crew, Tai Lung walked toward the soldiers. Each step was slow, deliberate, and heavy with a quiet power. \"Soldiers,\" he called out, his tone carrying effortlessly over the crowd. \"Stop what you are doing. You're giving our nation a bad name.\" All four soldiers turned toward him. The one in front, clearly the leader, gave a scoff of irritation. His smirk returned, but now it twisted with arrogance and annoyance. \"Great,\" he muttered, loud enough for all to hear, \"another noble son playing at justice.\" Tai Lung's expression didn't change. His eyes were steady, voice controlled. \"You are dishonoring yourself and the Fire Nation by your actions.\" The leader's smirk widened into something crueler. \"That's big talk,\" he said. \"We're just having a little fun with some lowly villagers. What's it to you?\" Tai Lung didn't respond. His eyes narrowed slightly, and he stepped forward, closing the distance between them. The leader raised an eyebrow. \"You want to fight, boy?\" In the blink of an eye, Tai Lung surged forward. A flash of motion, a flurry of brutal fists. The leader didn't even have time to brace, Tai Lung's strikes landed with pinpoint force, each one driving into muscle, joint, and nerves. Within seconds, the soldier was crumpled on the ground, groaning and barely conscious. The remaining three soldiers jumped up, hands going to their weapons. Before they could draw, Tai Lung raised his voice. \"I am Captain Tai Lung,\" he said, his voice loud enough for all to hear. \"Son of Admiral Lung.\" The soldiers froze. Murmurs swept through the crowd. The soldiers' eyes darted between Tai Lung and their fallen leader, hesitation written across their faces. Tai Lung continued, his tone as sharp as a commander's. \"This soldier has broken the laws of our nation. He assaulted a villager, and he made clear his intention to violate a woman. That is treason against our honor and our code.\" He turned his gaze down at the fallen man. \"He has brought us shame. Throw him in the brig. Let him serve as an example.\" The three soldiers didn't argue. Two of them moved quickly, lifting their unconscious leader, their hands trembling with restraint and nerves. Tai Lung looked at them coldly. \"I'll consider this obedience for now. He was your commanding voice, but next time, if you stand by such actions or assist in any shape or form, you will share in the punishment.\" Then he turned his head toward Han, who had silently followed the confrontation with a thoughtful expression. \"Help me draft a report,\" Tai Lung said. \"We'll send word to the capital. This man will face a proper trial.\" Han gave a short nod and moved to his side, pulling out a parchment and ink from his satchel. With the situation settling, Tai Lung turned to the villager, still kneeling in the dust and next to him his wife, both of them shaken and wary. \"I apologize for what you had to go through,\" Tai Lung said gently. \"You might not believe my words, but we have laws. And we expect our soldiers to follow a code of honor. What you experienced was the behavior of bad men, bad apples. We do not condone it.\" The man looked up slowly, eyes wide, mouth slightly parted, eyes never leaving Tai Lung's face. In all his years, he had never heard a Fire Nation soldier, let alone a noble, apologize. Most of them were worse than the regular troops, drunk on their lineage and eager to play conqueror. Yet here stood a noble son, young, powerful, and apologizing. He didn't know what to say. Tai Lung gave him a small, respectful nod, then turned away.\n\nThe first landfall after departing the Fire Nation was quiet.\n\nThe first landfall after departing the Fire Nation was quiet.\n\nThe first landfall after departing the Fire Nation was quiet.\n\nTai Lung stood at the edge of the deck, arms folded as the ship slowly glided into a modest harbor.

He remembered the village in the valley of peace from his past life, places he once terrorized after he was denied the Dragon Scroll, when he was betrayed by his father. Though he'd never killed anyone, the fear he'd caused, the destruction he wrought upon the villagers, the way he turned back on the teachings of the Jade Palace, had been enough to earn his chains. And yet here, the same cruelty, or worse, was being enacted by soldiers who called themselves honorable, and no one was punishing them.\n\nTai Lung's eyes turned back to the villagers.

            "content": "The sea stretched endlessly in every direction, the horizon shimmering under the sun as Tai Lung's ship cut through the waters of the Southern Sea. Their travel had become a rhythm of motion, sailing from one coastal point to another to restock supplies and allow Tai to explore the world beyond the Fire Nation. But the waters were not empty. Pirates and rogue Southern Water Tribe warriors prowled these seas, mistaking the Fire Nation vessel for easy prey. They attacked with confidence, their ships fast and their warriors fierce, at least until they came face-to-face with Tai Lung. The battles were short. Some attackers were injured. Others fell into the sea, their fate unknown. And a good number found themselves shackled in the brig below deck, their weapons confiscated and their pride broken. Whenever the ship made landfall, Tai Lung ensured the prisoners were handed over to Fire Nation garrisons for justice. On land, Tai Lung encountered earthbenders and so-called freedom fighters, scattered resistance remnants clinging to dreams of rebellion. But to Tai Lung, they were little more than children swinging sticks. Undisciplined. Sloppy. Lacking any real martial training or understanding of combat. He didn't waste more than a few moments with each skirmish. Their voyage eventually turned southeast, where warmer winds carried them toward a lonely island, its jagged cliffs cutting into the sky like teeth. As they approached, the waters grew darker, heavier. That's when the sea stirred. A deafening roar erupted from beneath the waves. The water split apart as a monstrous eel-like beast surged toward them, a leviathan of the deep. Its maw opened wide, its eyes glowing with fury as it lunged for the ship. The soldiers shouted, scrambling across the deck, but Tai Lung stepped forward. With one motion, he unleashed a brilliant torrent of blue flame, so hot and immense it lit up the sky like a second sun. The Unagi reared back, its roar turning to a screech as the fire blazed past its face. It dove beneath the waves and vanished without a trace. The ship rocked gently in the monster's wake, and the stunned silence of the crew was quickly replaced by wild cheers. \"Long live the captain!\" they roared. \"Captain Tai Lung!\" They made landfall soon after, anchoring near a quiet cove. The island was lush, the trees thick and the air humid. A single dirt path led them toward a village nestled between the hills. But before they could reach it, they were intercepted. A dozen women in green with strange white makeup stood across the path, forming a line. They were dressed in light armor, wielding steel fans and round shields, their stances confident and measured. Tai Lung took a step forward, raising a hand in greeting. \"I am…\" he began. But the women moved before he could finish. With sharp cries, they charged, fans slicing through the air, shields locking in formation. The soldiers behind Tai Lung took a stance preparing for combat, but Tai Lung held up a hand. \"Stand down.\" Then he moved. The forest became a blur of motion as Tai Lung met the attackers head-on, fire bending forgotten. His fists moved with precision, his body fluid and unstoppable. He slipped between fans, deflected strikes with his forearms, and used his momentum to unbalance and disarm. One by one, the women fell, struck down with calculated force to their acupuncture, never more than necessary, but enough to strike the nerves and paralyze them. When the last one hit the ground, Tai Lung stood in the center of the clearing, untouched, surrounded by groaning bodies. \"Restrain them,\" Tai Lung ordered coolly, not even breathing hard. His men moved in quickly, tying the women's wrists as Tai Lung looked toward the distant village, eyes narrowed. Tai Lung's eyes drifted back to the women now being tied up by his soldiers. The soft rustle of rope and armor filled the clearing as the last of the defeated were secured. He folded his arms, expression unreadable. \"That was quite the greeting,\" he said dryly, his tone calm but edged with judgment. \"You're not bad… but not good either. Still, I must admit, you surprised me, I thought the Earth Army didn't take women among them.\" One of the captured women, likely in her late twenties or early thirties, raised her head, her gaze sharp. \"This isn't Earth Kingdom land, and we're not part of their armies,\" she said. \"We are the Kyoshi Warriors.\" Tai Lung didn't reply immediately. He turned instead to Han, who stood just behind him. \"Have you heard of them?\" Tai Lung asked. Han shrugged. \"First time. But I did hear of Kyoshi before. It was one of the Avatar's incarnations.\" Tai Lung nodded slightly. The name wasn't unfamiliar. He had heard tales of the legendary Avatar, the strongest bender to ever live, a master of the four elements and a force of unmatched power, a bender that keeps reincarnating in an endless cycle, but he went into hiding at the start of the war for unknown reason. Turning his attention back to the woman, Tai Lung narrowed his eyes. \"Doesn't seem like you're very famous,\" he said bluntly. \"But if what you say is true… then where are the men? Why do I only see women here?\" The leader didn't falter. \"The Kyoshi Warriors consist of women only.\" Tai Lung blinked, a frown tugging at his lips. \"Now that's stupid.\" Before the leader could reply, a younger girl, likely the youngest among them, snapped, \"We don't need men to fight for us! We're as good as they are! Better even\" \"Suki, don't speak,\" the leader said quickly, casting a firm look at the girl. Suki fell silent, but her eyes didn't. She glared at Tai Lung with unhidden defiance. Tai Lung noticed the change immediately. The venomous glares from all around him. A minute ago, they had been defiant but composed. Now, their anger had become personal. He blinked slowly, assessing them. \"These women have some serious issues,\" he muttered under his breath, then glanced to the side. \"Ri Run. Li Lan. Take off your helmets.\" Two soldiers stepped forward and removed their helmets, revealing their faces. Both were women, calm, confident, unbothered by the tension. Tai Lung pointed at them. \"We have both men and women in our army. The Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom? They don't allow women to fight. Which means a lot of talented benders get wasted.\" He turned his gaze back to the Kyoshi Warriors. \"You on this island are just as stupid as those two nations. But instead of banning women, you ban men. So I stand by my words, you're stupid.\" He gestured dismissively at their outfits. \"And what is with the strange clothing? If you want to fight, at least wear something more comfortable. More practical.\" The Kyoshi Warriors seethed. No one liked being called stupid. Their hateful stares bore into Tai Lung, yet some couldn't help but consider his words. He had defeated all of them alone. And his logic, no matter how blunt, had truth to it. Tai Lung turned again to Han. \"How come this island hasn't been conquered by now?\" Han shrugged. \"Most of our army is stationed on the mainland. No one bothers coming to a small island like this.\" Tai Lung nodded thoughtfully, then waved his hand. \"Drag them along. We're heading to the village.\" As his soldiers began pulling the bound warriors behind them, the leader raised her voice. \"You're not allowed to go there. You're not welcome.\" Tai Lung didn't even look back. \"Idiots,\" he muttered, walking toward the village without a second thought. Behind him, the Kyoshi Warriors burned with fury. The arrogance of their enemy was unmatched, but so was the strength that backed it. ___________ As the Fire Nation soldiers marched into the village, a heavy silence blanketed the air. The villagers, catching sight of the red and black uniforms, immediately scattered. Doors slammed shut, shutters were drawn, and not a soul dared step into the streets. Only one man remained. A middle-aged man with graying hair and trembling hands slowly walked forward. His eyes were wide with fear, flicking between the firebenders and the bound Kyoshi Warriors being dragged behind them. When he recognized the defeated warriors, he paled even further, dread washing over his features. Tai Lung stepped forward, his tone calm but cold. \"Are you the leader of this village?\" The man swallowed hard. \"I-I… Yes. I am the chief,\" he stammered, then quickly added, \"We are not part of the Earth Kingdom. We have stayed out of the war this whole time… and we don't want to start now.\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed. \"The moment you attacked us, you became part of it,\" he said flatly. \"And frankly, no one would believe you when you say you're not part of the Earth Kingdom.\" He took a step closer. \"So let's get straight to the point. I am Captain Tai Lung of the fire nation navy. I offer you the choice to surrender unconditionally to us and become a vassal of the Fire Nation.\" The chief's face twisted in shock. Behind him, the Kyoshi Warriors stirred, trying to resist despite their bindings. Several of them screamed, \"Don't listen to them, Chief! We are the proud Kyoshi Island! Do not bow to them!\" The soldiers holding them gripped the ropes tighter, straining to keep the warriors restrained. Tai Lung punched toward the sky. In an instant, an enormous pillar of searing blue fire erupted upward, lighting the sky with an eerie brilliance. The heat radiating from it could be felt even from a distance. The Kyoshi Warriors froze, eyes wide in disbelief and fear at the overwhelming display of power. Tai Lung's voice rang out above the silence. \"I alone can turn this entire village into ashes, let alone the soldiers that follow me.\" His gaze swept across the terrified villagers peeking through their windows. \"Surrender now, and you will be spared that fate. You will continue your lives as you always have, in peace. The only difference is, if a Fire Nation ship comes by, you will not attack it. I do not leave enemies behind to ambush my people.\" The chief trembled where he stood. He looked at the villagers peering out of their homes, at the bound warriors still struggling, then back at Tai Lung, still radiating power like a living inferno. After a long, heavy pause, the chief slowly lowered his head. \"Kyoshi Warriors,\" he said softly, \"please… stay down.\" Then, more firmly, \"I, as the chief of the village, accept to become a vassal of the Fire Nation.\"\n\nThe sea stretched endlessly in every direction, the horizon shimmering under the sun as Tai Lung's ship cut through the waters of the Southern Sea.

Others fell into the sea, their fate unknown. And a good number found themselves shackled in the brig below deck, their weapons confiscated and their pride broken. Whenever the ship made landfall, Tai Lung ensured the prisoners were handed over to Fire Nation garrisons for justice.\n\nPirates and rogue Southern Water Tribe warriors prowled these seas, mistaking the Fire Nation vessel for easy prey.

But to Tai Lung, they were little more than children swinging sticks. Undisciplined. Sloppy. Lacking any real martial training or understanding of combat. He didn't waste more than a few moments with each skirmish.\n\nOn land, Tai Lung encountered earthbenders and so-called freedom fighters, scattered resistance remnants clinging to dreams of rebellion.

When he recognized the defeated warriors, he paled even further, dread washing over his features.\n\nTai Lung stepped forward, his tone calm but cold. \"Are you the leader of this village?\"\n\nTai Lung stepped forward, his tone calm but cold. \"Are you the leader of this village?\"\n\nTai Lung stepped forward, his tone calm but cold. \"Are you the leader of this village?\"\n\nThe man swallowed hard. \"I-I… Yes.

I am the chief,\" he stammered, then quickly added, \"We are not part of the Earth Kingdom.

Do not bow to them!\"\n\nThe chief's face twisted in shock. Behind him, the Kyoshi Warriors stirred, trying to resist despite their bindings. Several of them screamed, \"Don't listen to them, Chief!

            "content": "The Kyoshi warriors stood silently, heads bowed in shame. Though they bore no wounds on their skin, their spirits carried the weight of failure and defeat. They had trained all their lives, sworn to defend their island with their lives, yet now, bound in defeat after facing their first real opponent, they watched helplessly as their chief submitted to a young man, some would even consider a boy, from the Fire Nation scum. Some among them, especially the younger ones, glared with unspoken fury, the fire of rebellion still flickering behind their eyes. But for now, they held their tongues. Without so much as a glance back, Tai Lung spoke, his voice calm and commanding. \"Since they've surrendered, release them. There's no need to keep them restrained. We honor our word. You will live as you always have. But make no mistake, if you choose to pick a fight again, we won't be merciful.\" The soldiers obeyed at once, loosening the ropes and stepping back. The girls didn't thank him, they simply stood, rubbing at their wrists, their pride as wounded as ever. The chief, standing awkwardly nearby, gave them a pleading look, silently urging them to comply for the good of the village. They all saw it. The unspoken desperation in his eyes made their fists clench tighter. Tai Lung took a few steps forward and added, \"We came here to rest and resupply. Nothing more. We need food.\" The chief's face drained of color immediately. He raised his hands in a gesture of desperation. \"Have mercy, please… We are just a small village…\" Tai Lung interrupted with a wave of his hand. \"No need to be wary. We will pay you a fair price.\" Still, the chief hesitated, clearly distraught by these words. Before he could find a response, a sharp voice cut through the air. \"I knew it,\" Suki said, stepping forward. \"Your people are here to destroy our village.\" Tai Lung turned to her, genuinely confused \"Can't you understand human language? I said buy food. Buy. Not steal. Not burn.\" Suki's eyes burned with emotion. \"The village barely has food because of the famine,\" she snapped. \"And now you want to buy what little we have left? What is there to understand?\" Tai Lung went quiet. His golden eyes studied her for a moment, then shifted to the chief. \"Is this true?\" The chief gave a weak nod. \"We're barely able to feed the villagers as it is.\" Tai Lung let out a long breath and turned his back to them \"Then there's nothing more to say.\" Without another word, he walked away. Behind him, the Fire Nation soldiers followed, leaving behind a stunned group of villagers and warriors who had expected fire and fury for the request denial, yet witnessed restraint and clear code of honor. At the edge of the village, Han looked at Tai Lung with a frown \"You do realize we still need to resupply, right? We're nearly out of food on the ship.\" Tai Lung nodded. \"We'll fish from the sea.\" Han raised an eyebrow. \"You mean the same sea that welcomed us with an oversized fish? You want to hunt that?\" \"Not necessarily,\" Tai Lung replied with a faint smirk. \"Anything will do. We just need enough to last until the next port.\" Han gave a thoughtful nod. \"It's your call, Captain. But… usually we just take what we need from villages, if we have to.\" Tai Lung didn't slow down. \"It's dishonorable to steal. Let alone terrorize and steal from helpless villagers.\" \"You know, your flames and words terrorized them the most\" Han said with a smile. \"If they knew we can end them anytime but chose peace without abusing them, I believe they wouldn't have stupid ideas or cause us trouble\" Tai Lung replied, then the group fell silent. When they reached the coast where waves lapped lazily at the shore. Tai Lung began removing his armor, piece by piece, until he stood in simple cloth wraps beneath the sun. His hair rippled in the sea breeze, his back to his men. \"I'll dive and see what I can find,\" he said, his tone final. \"You take the ship and prepare to pick up whatever I bring in.\" Han turned to the crew. \"You heard the Captain. Let's move.\" As the soldiers scrambled to follow orders, Tai Lung stood at the edge of the water. With a deep breath, he dove into the sea. From afar, the villagers and Kyoshi warriors watched the Tai Lung and his crew move, they weren't entirely sure what kind of Fire Nation soldier this crew was, their behavior didn't match the stories at all. ___________ Hours passed after Tai Lung's departure into the sea. Just before sunset, a commotion stirred near the edge of Kyoshi Village. Han and a few Fire Nation soldiers returned, dragging behind them three makeshift carts, each loaded with a massive, glistening Elephant Koi. The bright orange scales shone in the dying sunlight, drawing gasps from the villagers and Kyoshi Warriors alike. The soldiers stopped in the center of the square, drawing confused and wary stares from the people around. Han spoke plainly, \"Captain Lung hunted these himself. We had more than enough for our crew, so he sent the extra to you.\" Without waiting for thanks or reply, Han and the others turned around and began walking back toward the coast. As they moved out of the village's boundaries, one of the younger soldiers scoffed quietly. \"This village doesn't deserve the captain's kindness.\" Han just shrugged, his expression relaxed. \"Our captain follows the teachings of his academy more than most. He reminds me of his father. Admiral Lung is also a man of honor and fairness.\" Back in the village square, the mood shifted. For the first time in days, smiles returned to weary faces. Children peeked from behind their mothers' legs, wide-eyed at the enormous fish. Adults, once stoic and guarded, showed tentative joy. \"I can't believe this is happening,\" the village chief muttered in disbelief. \"The Fire Nation… is helping us?\" One of the younger Kyoshi Warriors voiced the thoughts on many minds. \"I thought they were evil conquerors… that all they knew was terrorizing and killing.\" The Kyoshi leader crossed her arms and frowned. \"I fear they are plotting something.\" Another warrior scoffed. \"Plotting what? That young leader of theirs took all of us down, and without even bending. And did you see his fire? Blue. That wasn't normal firebending. There's no way we could fight that.\" Her comment was met with silent, solemn agreement. The captain of the Fire Nation soldiers wasn't just a soldier in their eyes, He was a monster. ___________ At dawn the next morning, the Kyoshi Warriors gathered quietly and departed the village, heading for the coast. The Fire Nation ship was still docked nearby. The warriors had two intentions: to keep watch over the foreigners… and to thank them for the food they had delivered. As they approached, one of the girls spotted movement near the jagged rocks that lined the shoreline. \"There,\" she whispered, pointing. The girls crept closer and their eyes widened. It was him, the person who had bested them all the day before. Tai Lung stood shirtless in the pale light of morning, his breath slow and focused. With no fire, no bending, he drove his fists and legs into the rugged stone, shattering the edges with every strike. The warriors stood in awe. The sheer force he was using… the power behind each motion. It was brutal. It was scary. And it made yesterday's defeat all the more haunting. They realized in silence, he had gone easy on them more than they thought. Had he truly given them the same treatment of these rocks… they wouldn't be standing here now. Bones would have broken. Limbs might have shattered. Then, without warning, Tai Lung stopped. His breathing didn't even sound labored. He turned and raised an eyebrow when he saw them. \"What are you doing here so early?\" he asked as he walked toward them, sweat glistening off his body. The Kyoshi leader stepped forward, her voice awkward and unsure. \"We… wanted to thank you for the food you gave the village yesterday.\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed slightly. \"This early? And with so many of you?\" The girls tensed, their expressions shifting from calm to concerned, perhaps even fearful, except for one. Suki met his gaze evenly. \"How did you hunt the Koi fish… with the Unagi around?\" Tai Lung tilted his head. \"Unagi? Is it the oversized eel?\" Suki nodded. \"Ever since it showed up, we haven't been able to fish in the sea. It attacks any boat in sight.\" Tai Lung responded simply, \"It attacked our ship yesterday. After we repelled it, it kept its distance.\" Suki's eyes widened. \"You… repelled it?\" He didn't reply. Instead, he turned to the Kyoshi leader. \"We're leaving the island as soon as the rest of my crew is up.\" With that, Tai Lung turned and walked away, leaving the stunned warriors behind. ___________ Not long after their early morning encounter with Tai Lung, the Kyoshi Warriors remained at the coast, quietly observing the Fire Nation ship. There was sudden movement, soldiers running about in swift, coordinated lines, preparing the vessel for departure. The sails unfurled, the anchors pulled up, and the ship began to drift away from Kyoshi Island, slowly vanishing over the sea's horizon. The girls stood in silence, their expressions conflicted. They had grown up on stories, tales etched into their minds, stories of Fire Nation brutality, of villages razed to ash, of children taken from their homes, of entire bloodlines wiped out in the name of conquest. The Fire Nation were monsters, every soldier a soulless killer draped in red and black. But those men… the ones on that ship… they were nothing like the stories. The girls exchanged glances. They attacked them first, unprovoked, and yet none of them were hurt. No burns. No lives lost. Instead of retaliation, they had shown restraint. Instead of demanding supplies, they had offered to buy them. And when the village couldn't provide, they simply walked away. And then, they brought back food. Suki thought to herself [They gave us food, For nothing in return] She wasn't alone in her conflicted thoughts. The girls watched as the ship grew smaller in the distance. Just as it reached the edge of the bay, the water beneath it rippled violently. The surface of the ocean surged and with a thunderous roar, the Unagi emerged, towering above the waves, its serpentine body coiling with fury. It roared at the Fire Nation vessel, ready to strike. The Kyoshi Warriors' eyes widened in collective horror. The sea monster had returned. They tensed instinctively, but then remembered Tai Lung's words. 'We repelled it.' Now they would witness how. In the next breath, a streak of blue lightning tore through the air, lancing from the ship with unnatural might. It struck the Unagi mid-roar. There was a split-second of silence before the beast howled in pain, its body convulsing as arcs of energy danced across its wet flesh. Then, with a final cry, the creature collapsed back into the sea, lifeless. The water calmed, the terror that had plagued their shores for months… gone. Just like that. A shiver ran down the girls' spines. No words were spoken, the power they had just witnessed shocked them. The Fire Nation killed the sea monster effortlessly. Suki swallowed hard. They all knew who had done it. The young captain. They had attacked him without reason. Had he been like the fire soldiers in stories… if even a fragment of those tales had been true… Their entire village would be ash.\n\nThe Kyoshi warriors stood silently, heads bowed in shame. Though they bore no wounds on their skin, their spirits carried the weight of failure and defeat. They had trained all their lives, sworn to defend their island with their lives, yet now, bound in defeat after facing their first real opponent, they watched helplessly as their chief submitted to a young man, some would even consider a boy, from the Fire Nation scum. Some among them, especially the younger ones, glared with unspoken fury, the fire of rebellion still flickering behind their eyes.

            "content": "The province of Tu Zen lay like a quiet patchwork of green on the maps of the Earth Kingdom: a medium–sized province, south–east of Omashu, sharing a border south of Si Wong State. It was a place noted for its forests and broad agricultural plains that fed thousands. To those who prized drama and war, Tu Zen might have seemed almost insultingly ordinary. To those who loved soil and seed, it was everything. Tai Lung and his crew arrived by a narrow river that curled east of Kyoshi Island in the south, a waterway that ran its slow course between Gao Ling and Zhou. Their ship slid into the province like a careful animal into a clearing, and when it docked Tai Lung stepped ashore at the head of his small party with Vice Captain Han at his shoulder. \"The City of Tu Zen was a relatively small Earth Kingdom city. Since it was conquered ninety years ago,\" Han said as they walked \"there has been no real rebellion, no attempt to resist the Fire Nation. The people here are farmers. Many have never raised a weapon in their lives. And that was long before the war had started a hundred years ago.\" Tai Lung listened patiently then asked \"Is anything special about this city?\" Han's mouth tilted. \"None. It's one of the most boring places to be in. But it is not the same story for the nearby forest. It has always been known as a forest of spirits. People around here don't dare approach it, they fear angering the spirits dwelling among the trees.\" Tai Lung's gaze sharpened with something like interest. \"So there are spirits in the forest we can meet?\" Han hesitated. \"I am not sure. As far as I am aware our army marched through the forest decades ago and we encountered no wrath or spirits.\" He paused, then added in a lower tone half admonition, half jest \"But not long ago we heard news that some of our soldiers were attacked by spirits and stripped of everything except their underwear.\" \"You think it is the work of spirits or bandits?\" Tai Lung asked. Han gave an approving smile. \"Bandits. I do believe spirits could get angry and vengeful, but the state of our soldiers matched the work of bandits more.\" Their conversation cut short with a sound that could have been the wail of some small, affronted beast, a man's voice shrieking: \"My cabbages!!\" Both Tai Lung and Han stared toward the commotion. They found an Earth Kingdom merchant in the square, wild–eyed and wailing over a heap of ruined vegetables on the stones. Cabbages lay trampled, leaves scattered like injured birds. Next to the ruined heap stood another Earth Kingdom man, looking unrepentant, and at his side a Koala Sheep was happily munching what remained. The man's manner was brisk, dismissive. \"They are just a few cabbages,\" he said. \"Don't cause trouble over them.\" \"Just cabbages? JUST CABBAGES!! HOW DARE YOU?\" the merchant screamed in fury and pain. The cabbages merchant became angrier by the moment that it seemed he was on the verge of attacking the man. Unexpectedly, Han moved toward them \"Cai!! calm down,\" he said, his voice laced with the sort of patience that comes from having settled more quarrels than a man could remember. The merchant, who had been seething a moment before, stopped completely. His face, fierce one breath earlier, turned bright and eager. He pointed a finger at the Koala Sheep's owner and cried, \"Mr. Han! They destroyed my cabbages and acted as if they had done nothing. Off with their heads! They must be punished.\" The other man stood shocked, blinking as the sudden call for capital punishment. \"Are you crazy?\" he spluttered. \"You want to kill me because my Koala Sheep ate a few cabbages? Sir, this man is crazy!!\" His hands fluttered, helpless, angry and afraid now. Tai Lung had moved closer by then, watching with an amused, quiet interest. He saw the merchant's face, saw the ridiculous inflamed grievance that had turned a man into a small volcano. \"That's an excessive punishment,\" he observed, \"but it is fair to be paid for the price of your ruined cabbages.\" Tai Lung's eyes focused on the man with the Koala Sheep. \"Pay the merchant for the loss you caused him,\" Tai Lung continued. The man retorted, \"Pay him? They are rotten cabbages!!\" \"It doesn't matter,\" Tai Lung said. \"He owns them and had a price for them. You destroyed them and you have to pay. If you don't, we can consider other physical punishments.\" Color drained from the man's face. He reached into his purse, paid the merchant grudgingly, and left with his head bowed. Yet the merchant's glare did not soften. Even after receiving his coin he continued to scowl hatefully at the man who had fed his sheep. Han shook his head with weary amusement. \"Cai, you are getting more ridiculous by the day. Now you are asking to kill for cabbages? What next, one life per cabbage?\" Cai replied, for the likes of him, one cabbage worth more than his entire life,\" the merchant snapped back, for a moment it looked like these words coming from convention instead of anger.. Han sighed. Tai Lung, intrigued, asked, \"A friend of yours?\" Han's answer was careful. \"I wouldn't say we are friends, but you could call him a friend of your father.\" Tai Lung had not expected his father to be drawn here in some random local tangle. The merchant, hearing Han's words, focused on Tai Lung , then as if struck by lighting, his face brightened. \"You must be Admiral Lung's son! How is your father? Is he around? I have information for him!!\" \"No, Father is not here,\" Tai Lung answered, \"What news do you have? We can deliver it back.\" Cai's eyes darted about the square. He lowered his voice until it was almost a hiss. \"Let's talk elsewhere, too many eyes and ears here.\" Without another word he turned and began to thread his way away from the crowd.. Tai Lung glanced at Han. The man's expression had gone suddenly serious; a motion of the head was all the invitation Tai Lung needed. Together they followed the merchant to a tucked–away corner. Cai looked around again, lips drawn tight, as if ensuring that no one listened, then leaned in. \"I have important information,\" he said. \"The forest nearby is full of Fire Nation deserters and traitors.\" Tai Lung's brow creased. \"How do you know that?\" he asked. Cai's mouth hardened. \"I have my own resources. But the information is absolutely true. Recently your soldiers were attacked and stripped by them.\" He glanced toward Han as if to make certain the words landed. \"Do you know how many we are talking about?\" Han inquired. \"A little over twenty,\" Cai replied. Tai Lung considered it for a heartbeat, then said, simply, \"We can check it while we are here. I wanted to go into the forest anyway\" Then he shifted the conversation. \"So, that's how you know my father. You are a spy for our nation?\" Cai's face reddened at the suggestion. \"Of course not. I am an Earth Kingdom citizen.\" He spoke the words confidently, prideful even. Tai Lung paused at that, then inclined his head. \"I see.\" Cai's fingers curled, a twitch of indignation rising. \"You!! I am not a traitor! I will not accept such an accusation!\" His voice had climbed a pitch; his hands were visibly clenched. \"I didn't say anything but you are indeed a traitor,\" Tai Lung told him bluntly. \"Your face spoke for you,\" Cai snapped back. \"No; I am no traitor. The Earth Kingdom betrayed me! You don't know even a fraction of the crimes and acts of hate they have done against me through the years. This is all for the grievances they have given me.\" Toward the end his voice cracked; his fists squeezed so tightly the knuckles went white and his eyes shone with unchecked tears. For a moment Tai Lung said nothing. At last his tone shifted, softened. \"What have they done to you?\" he asked. Cai's head bowed as though recalling the worst things imaginable to humans. He spoke as if recounting a nightmare he could not wake from. \"Over and over they destroyed my cabbages and I could only watch helplessly. I begged for justice but no one cared, they even laughed at me. Only the Fire Nation, good men like your father, and you stood for my cabbages.\" His voice was small, but redolent with a conviction so absolute. Tai Lung could not hide his astonishment at the absurdity he was hearing. Cai saw the look and, as if to seal the truth of his grievance, nodded quickly. \"Yes. It was that bad. For years I lived to see my cabbages get destroyed. None of these fools can see the beauty and wisdom of the cabbage, but I do. I will take revenge for every destroyed cabbage!\" He said the last words with a terrible, trembling earnestness. Tai Lung inclined his head once and then smiled. \"I won't take more of your time. Go back to your cabbages.\" Cai brightened as if released from a spell. \"Good luck with the traitors,\" he said, earnest again, and bowed in the strangest sort of respect. \"Send my greetings to your father.\" Tai Lung turned to Han. The man's expression had broken into a grin and then the grin became laughter, sudden and loud. \"Your face was priceless!\" Han said as he laughed. \"That man is crazy,\" Tai Lung said at last, a faint amusement threading his words. \"Maybe,\" Han admitted, still smiling, \"but his information is always spot on. He knows things that no one should. He's better at gathering news than our best spies and informants. Your father calls him the Cabbage Bender, the greatest spy in the world.\" For an instant, Tai Lung's amusement curdled into reflection. His gaze drifted, thoughtful and oddly solemn. Han noticed and frowned. \"You're thinking about the deserters, aren't you?\" \"No,\" Tai Lung said slowly. \"I'm thinking about the cabbage lunatic.\" Han blinked. \"What?\" Tai Lung folded his arms, his tone unexpectedly serious. \"Some spiritual masters can form deep connections with the universe. What if that man's love for his cabbages became so strong, so absolute, that it forged a bond between him and them? All things are connected, Han. If his devotion was powerful enough, perhaps he found a way to… communicate with them.\" There was a long pause. Then Tai Lung looked at Han with utter sincerity and said, \"Maybe he isn't the Cabbage Bender… but the Cabbage Messenger.\" Han stared at him, mouth slightly open. \"He's just a crazy man and your father was joking, Captain! You're thinking far too much into this!\"\n\nThe province of Tu Zen lay like a quiet patchwork of green on the maps of the Earth Kingdom: a medium–sized province, south–east of Omashu, sharing a border south of Si Wong State. It was a place noted for its forests and broad agricultural plains that fed thousands. To those who prized drama and war, Tu Zen might have seemed almost insultingly ordinary. To those who loved soil and seed, it was everything.\n\nThe province of Tu Zen lay like a quiet patchwork of green on the maps of the Earth Kingdom: a medium–sized province, south–east of Omashu, sharing a border south of Si Wong State.

            "content": "Tai Lung decided to follow the Cabbage Merchant's information and investigate the supposed deserters hiding in the nearby forest. Along with him came Han and two others from his crew. As the group walked through the dense forest, Han glanced sideways at Tai Lung and said, \"I didn't expect you to look for deserters based on Cai's words alone.\" Tai Lung's expression remained calm. \"I wanted to visit the forest to begin with,\" he said. \"And I did tell Father I wouldn't just drift aimlessly. I think it counts if we catch deserters. Besides,\" a faint smirk tugged at his mouth, \"the Cabbage Messenger went out of his way to warn us. How could we ignore him?\" Han gave a strange look. \"Do you really think he can talk to cabbages?\" he asked. \"I don't know,\" Tai Lung replied thoughtfully. \"He might truly be able to communicate with them or perhaps he has a spiritual connection with the universe… or maybe he's simply too good at gossiping. Personally,\" he added after a pause, \"I hope he really is connected with cabbages or the universe.\" Han raised a brow. \"And why is that, exactly?\" \"Because,\" Tai Lung said, his voice carrying a distant, almost wistful note, \"he would be proof that one can truly communicate with the universe, that there's a way to achieve inner peace and reach true chi mastery within the rules of this world.\" Han blinked at him, utterly baffled. \"What in the name of Agni are you talking about?\" Tai Lung didn't answer. His eyes drifted through the trees, his mind far away. In this world, there was no concept of inner peace or chi mastery. Here, bending was seen only as a path to strength and domination. A quiet loneliness settled over him. It seemed that only he knew the art of chi, the balance between body and spirit. Yet he could not share it, not when he wasn't certain if the universe's laws even allowed it to advance beyond a certain level. After a moment of silence, he said quietly, \"Don't mind me.\" Then, turning his gaze ahead, he asked, \"More importantly, how likely are we to encounter these deserters?\" Han shook his head. \"Hard to say. The forest is too large, and searching every corner will take us days, if not weeks. Personally, I think it is not worth searching the forest blindly based on Cai's words alone\" \"Is it now? You said his information is always accurate, why the change now?\" Tai Lung asked. Han replied \"I just don't like the idea of searching the forest for deserters, if you want to follow the admiral's words, then fighting in some local skirmish or catching bandits is better and simpler than this wild hunt\" \"I see, well we are already here, let's search for a day or two, if we found them that's great, if not we leave\" Tai Lung replied nonchalantly. Han didn't say anything else. The group continued their march in relative silence. Hours passed until, after nearly three hours, Tai Lung suddenly raised his hand. \"Stop,\" he ordered. The group froze instantly. Han looked around, puzzled. \"What is it?\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed, scanning the ground ahead. \"There are traps hidden in front of us,\" he said quietly. \"And judging by their size, they're not meant for small animals.\" \"If there are traps here, and they belong to the deserters,\" Han murmured, \"then we might be approaching their camp or they're nearby, waiting for some victim to step into one.\" Tai Lung nodded. His golden eyes gleamed narrowed slightly as he said, \"Follow my lead. We'll move slowly and disable the traps as we go.\" And so they advanced through the forest carefully, step by step. The soldiers moved silently, their boots barely making any noise. Tai Lung crouched every few paces, deftly disarming snares and tripwires. Eventually, they reached a small river winding through the trees. Near its bank stood several crude huts made of sticks and bark, smoke rising weakly from dying fires. A handful of figures lingered near the water fishing. Tai Lung straightened, his eyes narrowing. \"We found our targets faster than expected,\" he said, his voice low and calm. Then, without hesitation, he strode forward. The soldiers followed, weapons drawn, their gazes alert. The figures by the river noticed them almost instantly. Shouts rang out as the ragged people scrambled to raise their spears, forming a defensive line. Tai Lung studied them calmly. They were dressed in rags and leaves, their skin darkened and rough, their faces bearing Fire Nation features, yet something about them didn't quite match. There was a touch of the Earth Kingdom in their bearing, the rough life among the trees left its mark on them. \"Put your weapons down and surrender,\" Tai Lung said, his tone even but commanding. \"No need to make this hard for yourselves.\" A silence followed before an old man emerged from one of the huts. His gait was slow but steady, his face marked by two deep parallel scars along his eyes and face. His eyes, sharp and wary, fixed on Tai Lung. \"You're too young to be a soldier,\" the man said gravely. \"Has the madness reached the point where children now join the war?\" Tai Lung's gaze didn't change. \"No,\" he replied simply. \"I am a special case. I'll repeat. surrender. You're outmatched.\" A bitter smile crossed the old man's face. \"Another child who hasn't learned discipline,\" he said. \"It pains me to see arrogance so young. You have much to learn before calling yourself special.\" For a heartbeat, Tai Lung said nothing. The words struck deeper than the man could have known. Discipline… arrogance…. Shifu's voice echoed in his memory, educating, cold, patient, relentless. His master's lessons had been carved into his bones. No one demanded discipline like Shifu, no one taught harder than Shifu. Then arrogance wasn't through how he viewed others, how he met Po. [Was he looking at others through the lens of arrogance again?] he thought bitterly. [Am I underestimating my opponent, just like before?] The thought stung, and with it came anger, not toward the old man, but himself and this habit. His calm expression hardened; his shoulders tensed. He inhaled sharply, calming his breath. \"Then fight it is,\" Tai Lung said, voice cold and deliberate. \"But be warned, I'm not holding back.\" The old man's eyes narrowed. He felt something shift, the air around Tai Lung seemed to radiate danger and violence. \"Young one,\" he said, his voice steady but low, \"your eyes… they're full of brutality and savagery. As if you've never been taught restraint.\" Tai Lung's expression darkened. \"I was taught to be efficient and brutal,\" he said, each word measured like a strike. \"To make my enemies suffer for their weakness or mistakes.\" His gaze sharpened further, the gold in his eyes glinting with malice. \"And I admit… I let my arrogance cloud my judgment for a moment. No more.\" The last words were spoken to himself, almost like a vow. Then, without warning, Tai Lung moved. The air cracked with speed as he shot forward, faster than anyone could. The old man barely had time to react before Tai Lung was upon his men. The deserters rushed to meet him, shouting battle cries, but their cries turned to groans in mere seconds. Tai Lung's movements were a blur, brutal and merciless. A sweep of his leg sent one man flying; a twist of his wrist shattered another's spear; a single strike left two men crumpled in the dirt. By the time the old man registered what was going on, it was over. The men lay sprawled on the ground, their weapons broken, their bodies writhing in pain. The only sound was the crackle of the river and the faint moans of defeat. The old man stood frozen, his eyes wide in disbelief. Never, never, had he seen someone fight like that. It wasn't human, nor the refined technique of a bender. It was something else entirely, efficient, cold, and predatory like a beast. He began to wonder if this young man before him was even a bender. When Tai Lung's eyes turned toward him, the old man felt a chill crawl down his spine. For the first time in many years, he realized he could not afford to hold back. The old man took his stance, preparing to face Tai Lung, but as he observed him more carefully he asked, \"Young man, what is your name?\" \"I am Tai Lung,\" Tai Lung replied. \"Are you Shulian Lung's son?\" the old man asked. Tai Lung raised an eyebrow. \"You know my father?\" The old man nodded. \"He was a captain under my command back in the day. I was also his master, I taught him firebending.\" Tai Lung was taken aback. \"My father never told me about you, or that he had a master.\" The old man sighed. \"I am Jeong Jeong, an ex-admiral of the Fire Nation and the first person to become a deserter there. Your father didn't take kindly to my actions and viewed them as a betrayal.\" \"If that's true,\" Tai Lung said, \"then it is all the more reason I must bring you in.\"\n\nTai Lung decided to follow the Cabbage Merchant's information and investigate the supposed deserters hiding in the nearby forest.

Tai Lung's movements were a blur, brutal and merciless. A sweep of his leg sent one man flying; a twist of his wrist shattered another's spear; a single strike left two men crumpled in the dirt.\n\nThe deserters rushed to meet him, shouting battle cries, but their cries turned to groans in mere seconds.

It wasn't human, nor the refined technique of a bender. It was something else entirely, efficient, cold, and predatory like a beast. He began to wonder if this young man before him was even a bender.\n\nThe old man stood frozen, his eyes wide in disbelief. Never, never, had he seen someone fight like that.

            "content": "Jeong Jeong stood firm as he said \"Why have you become so hostile, young one?\" Tai Lung's expression hardened, his voice cold. \"It is devastating to see the master you trusted so much turn his back on you and betray you. I'm sure Father will be pleased to hear the news of your fall.\" Jeong Jeong's brows furrowed, though his voice remained calm. \"I did not betray your father. I abandoned the Fire Nation and their mad war. I could not, in good conscience, watch so much destruction and death unfold.\" \"You could have retired,\" Tai Lung said flatly. Jeong Jeong shook his head. \"It is not enough. Retirement won't absolve me of the mistakes I made.\" \"Then you should be prepared to face the consequences of your choices,\" Tai Lung said, his tone colder still. He knew too well the sting of betrayal, the sight of a trusted master turning away. The reason behind it didn't matter to him; the wound was the same. The thought of it, that his own father had suffered similar betrayal lit a quiet fury within him. His decision was already made. Tai Lung lunged forward, but Jeong Jeong's arms rose in a swift motion. From the ground beneath Tai Lung's feet, fire burst forth, forcing him back. Tai Lung narrowed his eyes, splitting the flames with his blue fire then stepping through.. Jeong Jeong's eyes widened, the faintest trace of surprise flickering across his face. \"You wield blue fire? Then why didn't you use it earlier?\" \"I prefer to fight with my martial arts,\" Tai Lung replied coolly. \"They are my specialty, they represent what I am.\" Jeong Jeong studied him with intrigue. Blue fire was rare, a mark of unmatched talent among firebenders. To hear one speak of such a gift as though it were secondary was… astonishing. He had expected arrogance, or restraint perhaps, but not this. \"You are a strange one,\" Jeong Jeong said softly. Tai Lung charged again. The old man responded in kind, unleashing a volley of blazing fireballs. Tai Lung dodged each with fluid grace, until the ground beneath him erupted once more, forcing him to leap back. \"Is this wall of fire your signature move?\" Tai Lung asked, voice steady despite the wall of flame before him. \"You should watch your surroundings more carefully,\" Jeong Jeong replied, his voice echoing as he swept his hands outward. In that instant, the flames behind Tai Lung, which were ignited by Jeong Jeong attacks earlier, joined the wall of fire and encircled Tai Lung, then rotated around him and formed a roaring tornado. Fire spun and howled around him and the cage of fire closed on him from all directions. Tai Lung braced himself, then burst forward, blue fire erupting from his palms as he cut through the torrent. He pierced out of the fiery storm, only to find Jeong Jeong gone. His sharp eyes darted through the haze until his ears caught a faint sound behind him. He spun around just in time to see Jeong Jeong within the heart of the flames, smiling faintly before thrusting his palms forward. Fire surged toward Tai Lung like a living creature. There was no time to dodge. Tai Lung punched forward unleashing his own torrent of blue fire, the two streams colliding in a burst of flames. Jeong Jeong's voice rose above the roar. \"Your flames are stronger than your martial arts, boy. You can't deny that truth! You lack restraint and place too much faith in your fists, using your fire as a secondary weapon. That is not the way of a true firebender, let alone a master.\" Tai Lung said nothing. He wanted to master firebending, that much was true, but he would not abandon what made him Tai Lung. His kung fu, his martial arts were his essence, his pride, his identity. Yet deep down, he could not deny Jeong Jeong's words. His mind flashed to his battle with Ozai. The Fire Lord's flames had burned hotter and wilder than Jeong Jeong's, but that fight had been a contest of strength and speed, nothing more. There had been no strategy, no art in the flames. That was why he had triumphed then. But now… this old man relied on strategy and tricks. It took Tai Lung only a heartbeat to decide. If this was how his opponent wanted to fight, then so be it. He raised his hands, mirroring Jeong Jeong's movements exactly. The old man's eyes widened in alarm as fire erupted behind him, cutting off every path of retreat. \"I am quite the fast learner,\" Tai Lung said calmly, his blue fire reflecting in his eyes. \"And I don't plan on losing here. If I have to firebend instead using my martial arts, then so be it. You are not escaping me.\" Jeong Jeong's face fell into panic in an instant as Tai Lung moved and unleashed wave after wave of blue flame that roared toward him. It was unlike anything the old master had faced. He tried to dodge and defend, but the sheer power and volume of the flames pressed in on him until he could barely defend himself, his clothes getting seared by the flames. The roaring inferno swallowed Jeong Jeong's sight; fire closed in from every direction. He knew, with a cold certainty, that if this continued he would be defeated and worse, the flames were growing too fast, it won't be long before the whole forest would be sacrificed to this mad blaze. Amid the howling heat, Jeong Jeong forced his voice to rise so Tai Lung could hear it. \"Your flames will turn the entire forest to ashes,\" he called out. \"You must show restraint before the fire begins to spread.\" \"It won't.\" The voice came from his side and froze him in the throat. Jeong Jeong spun. Two feet from him stood Tai Lung, he had used the flames to veil his approach just as Jeong Jeong had done earlier. Jeong Jeong tried to make distance, but it was already too late. Dozens of blows landed: quick, powerful strikes at nerves and chi points. The old master staggered beneath the onslaught, then fell. In the space of heartbeats, Jeong Jeong, once an admiral and a feared firebending master, was on the forest floor. Tai Lung slowed, steadying his breathing and with it the fire all around them began to die down, the blue tongues licking themselves out into smoke and ash until the air settled, clearer and cooler. He looked down at the fallen man for a long moment. \"Chain them all,\" Tai Lung ordered. \"We are going back.\" Han and the others moved swiftly, acting on the captain's command. The deserters and their small, ragged band were bound and gathered before being led back to the city. —————— Later that night, Jeong Jeong sat in his cell with his men, shackled and silent. The heavy quiet was broken when the door opened and Han stepped inside, keys jangling at his hand. \"Master,\" Han said, forcing a small, conspiratorial grin, \"get out of here quickly. My scary captain is sleeping.\" Jeong Jeong raised his head slowly, eyes tired. \"Han,\" he said, \"I doubt Shulian's son will take kindly to your betrayal.\" Han's expression was steady. \"Yeah, he is something else. Honestly, it's scary to think he's angry with me. But this is a risk I'm willing to take, Master. I owe you that much.\" He worked the shackles loose, and one by one the prisoners were freed. Together they slipped out of the makeshift prison and hurried through the dark until the city's edge lay behind them. As they ran, Jeong Jeong glanced at his old student. Han offered a rueful smile. \"Shulian helped you in the past,\" he said softly. \"Today I repaid my debt to you. Next time you're on your own, Master. I sincerely hope you don't cross our path again.\" Jeong Jeong managed a small smile in answer and then hurried into the night. Han watched them go until their figures were swallowed by shadow, then breathed a long sigh of relief. He turned to go back to his place, but froze when he found Tai Lung staring at him coldly. Han, quick to cover his tremor, put on a loose grin. \"Captain, fancy seeing you here.\" \"Explain yourself,\" Tai Lung said. Han's grin faltered. \"Explain what? I betrayed the Fire Nation and released the prisoners.\" \"You said you were willing to take the risk because he was your master,\" Tai Lung said. \"Don't you feel angry at his betrayal?\" Han blinked. \"You were listening the whole time? Why didn't you stop me?\" \"I prefer to hear things before acting,\" Tai Lung replied. \"It is never too late to hunt them down. After fighting them, I know they can't escape my hunt.\" Han's face changed at that, a mix of worry and resignation. He exhaled and replied. \"When Master was an admiral, he took many soldiers under his wing. Just like your father, I was among these students. He trained us for years. I had to help him.\" \"Didn't you feel betrayed by his actions?\" Tai Lung asked. Han's voice was steady, threaded with memory rather than wrath. \"I was angry when I learned he deserted. But he taught us well, guided us up through the ranks, helped us survive the war. One act does not erase years of favor.\" Tai Lung absorbed the words, then said, \"My father did the same years ago?\" \"Not exactly,\" Han answered. \"He had a chance to capture Master, but he chose to turn a blind eye.\" Tai Lung closed his eyes. Shifu, the teacher who had been a father to him, had done so much for him over the years. But that single act of betrayal was enough for Tai Lung to forget everything and act on his anger. At that moment, Tai Lung felt too small. Beside his father and Han, he was nothing but a scum and vile animal. Without another word, Tai Lung turned and walked away. \"Captain?\" Han called, taken aback. Tai Lung did not look back as he said. \"The deserter and his people escaped in the middle of the night and no one noticed. Their escape was due to the carelessness of you, Vice-Captain Han. You deserve a punishment. Starting tomorrow, you will be responsible for overseeing the resupply process.\" Han blinked, then a slow smile spread across his face.\n\nJeong Jeong stood firm as he said \"Why have you become so hostile, young one?\"\n\nJeong Jeong stood firm as he said \"Why have you become so hostile, young one?\"\n\nJeong Jeong stood firm as he said \"Why have you become so hostile, young one?\"\n\nTai Lung's expression hardened, his voice cold. \"It is devastating to see the master you trusted so much turn his back on you and betray you.

            "content": "Tai Lung's ship cut through the ocean waves, heading straight toward the mainland where it reached a large military fortress situated along the coast. The harbor bustled with activity as Fire Nation banners waved proudly over the walls. This fortress was no ordinary outpost, it was relatively large, housing nearly a thousand soldiers. It operated under the authority of General Shinu, a pragmatic and seasoned leader of the Fire Nation Army. To Tai Lung's surprise, upon docking, both he and Han were immediately summoned to attend a war council. Curious about the sudden invite, the two men made their way through the fortifications and into the war chamber. Upon entering, Tai Lung took in the sight: a dozen high-ranking officers were gathered around a massive table, a detailed war map spread before them. At the head of the table stood a man with graying hair and a sharp gaze, General Shinu. Tai Lung needed only a glance to recognize the man's authority, but he also immediately noticed the cold, hostile stare directed at him. General Shinu didn't waste time. \"I've heard of you, Tai Lung,\" he said with measured disdain. \"Your infamy reached us all the way from the homeland.\" He paused, then added with a mocking tone, \"Let's hope you're as good at fighting the enemy as you are at challenging your superiors and drifting aimlessly around.\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed. \"What is this about?\" Shinu pointed at the map. \"A battalion of Ten thousand soldiers was ambushed at Zaofu Mountain Range. The one responsible is King Bumi of Omashu.\" That name caught Tai Lung's attention. He knew of Omashu, but Bumi… Shinu continued, \"Over half of our battalion was lost in the battle. The rest are trapped in the mountain range.\" \"Earth soldiers had surrounded them,\" one officer added grimly, \"The army of Omashu, led by the legendary mad king himself. They are using the location to their advantage, preventing the soldiers from escaping and they are planning on killing them off slowly\" \"We must prepare to defend this fortress, Omashu soldiers will march here eventually\" General Shinu stated, his voice firm. Tai Lung looked around at the room, then asked, \"How many enemies are we talking about?\" \"Three thousand,\" Shinu replied. Tai Lung frowned. \"Three thousand killed five thousand and trapped five more?\" It didn't make sense. Shinu rolled his eyes in annoyance seeing the frown on Tai Lung's face. \"Someone explain it to the boy.\" One of the officers spoke up. \"King Bumi is the oldest living king in the Earth Kingdom. He's said to be a hundred and ten years old, and widely regarded as the strongest earthbender alive, some say he is the strongest living bender across all nations. His army is composed of elite earthbenders and highly trained soldiers. He's also extremely intelligent, he set up the ambush at Zaofu, forcing our soldiers into a deadly trap while suffering little to no casualties himself. Many of the survivors are wounded and exhausted. They sent us a hawk messenger requesting us to send help.\" Tai Lung's brow furrowed. \"Then why not go assist the trapped forces? Leaving them on their own waiting for death.\" General Shinu's reply was cold and calculated. \"Because they can buy us time. If we ride out now, we risk joining them in a losing battle. It's better to hold the fortress and wait for reinforcements.\" Tai Lung frowned at that. \"So you would rather hold onto a fortress than save our people? If we move now, we can reduce the losses.\" General Shinu scoffed, \"We might be losing more if we go to help, not to mention the possibility of losing the fortress.\" His words echoed in the room, callous, perhaps, but strategic. Tai Lung was silent, but his glare lingered on the general, silently burning with disagreement. Tai Lung's gaze swept across the room, his eyes locking with those of the officers seated around the table. \"What about the rest of you?\" he asked, his voice calm but cutting. \"Any thoughts on what can be done besides holing up here? Or are we all just here to nod along and betray thousands just like that?\" Some of the officers met his stare with cold, unreadable expressions. Others glanced nervously at General Shinu, hesitation clear in their eyes. A few even looked down, avoiding his gaze altogether, fearful, uncertain, and unwilling to speak. General Shinu's voice rang with a mix of authority and anger. \"Captain Lung!!\" he growled, narrowing his eyes, \"my decision is final. I won't tolerate you sowing seeds of doubt among my men. You are to follow orders, or you will be considered a traitor.\" Tai Lung frowned, locking eyes with the general. \"Did you bring everyone here to share your decision,\" he asked sharply, \"or to think of a solution to help the trapped soldiers?\" The general scoffed, straightening his back with a puffed chest. \"I am the general in command,\" he said arrogantly. \"You are only supposed to follow orders, not question them. I'll let it slide this time, since you're young and this is your first war meeting. But don't think I won't throw you in a cell. You'd do well to watch yourself if you don't want to dishonor yourself and your father.\" Something snapped inside Tai Lung. His eyes narrowed into slits, fury beginning to stir in his chest. He was already getting pissed by the thought of betraying the trust of thousands and leaving them to their death. And now the general spoke to him like that. Who was this man to speak like that? Did this man truly believe he would lower his head in submission? Just like the Fire Lord had done nearly two years ago? Tai Lung began walking slowly around the war table, each step measured and deliberate. He stood right before the general, then spoke with a voice cold and disdainful. \"I really want to know… what gave you the guts to speak to me like that?\" Shinu's face twisted with fury. \"This is a disgrace! Disrespecting your superior? I'll make sure you rot in a prison cell!\" Tai Lung didn't speak another word. He moved like lightning, blindingly fast, and delivered a series of rapid, brutal strikes. The general was caught completely off guard, and before anyone could react, he was sent crashing into the metal wall behind him, collapsing unconscious. Gasps filled the chamber. The remaining officers stared in shock, in disbelief of the mutiny they had just witnessed. Tai Lung turned back to face them, his voice level and commanding. \"Now that fool is out of the way, let's get to work. Do we know what is going on there exactly? How the enemies are trying to kill our people? And any plans on how we can actually save our people? All suggestions are welcomed\" One of the officers finally broke the silence. \"What you've done… that's treason.\" Tai Lung scoffed. \"And leaving five thousand soldiers to die isn't? Spare me the lecture. Let's get to the real subject. If you are worried about being punished because of me, just say I threatened you into submission, that I am a mad man throwing blue fire and lighting around. I did humiliate and burn the Fire Lord publicly, no one will doubt your story.\" The officers glanced at one another again, and slowly, the fear in their expressions began to shift, turning into focus. They leaned over the map, their voices growing as they shared what they knew and thought. For the first time, they actually began discussing what they can do, talking about terrain, enemies, routes, coordination and enemy possible plans. After what felt like an hour of back and forth, a unified plan was formed, daring, dangerous, but possible. A rescue mission. Tai Lung stepped back from the table. \"Someone throw this idiot,\" he pointed to the unconscious general, \"in a cell, it is a fitting place for him. We leave in an hour.\" There was no protest. Just a nod and in several eyes, the faintest gleam of newfound respect. As Tai Lung exited the chamber, Han caught up with him, keeping pace. \"This plan of yours is suicide, King Bumi is extremely dangerous\" he said under his breath. \"If your father were here, he'd never approve of something like this.\" Tai Lung smirked. \"Good thing he's not. I'm looking forward to meeting the strongest and oldest living bender. I hope he is better than Jeong Jeong and the Fire Rooster\" Han looked at his young captain, a heavy sigh escaping his chest. All he could do now was pray the spirits would watch over Tai Lung. \"I will let the rest of the crew know of this plan and that we are going to stay here for a while\" Han said. Tai Lung nodded and thanked him before looking toward the north. This was going to be his first real participation in the war. He still didn't like the thought of fighting, but he was part of the Fire Nation now, and he wouldn't fail his father in this life.\n\nTai Lung's ship cut through the ocean waves, heading straight toward the mainland where it reached a large military fortress situated along the coast.

            "content": "The golden rays of morning filtered through the windows of the Fire Nation High Command, casting a regal glow over the war room. Admiral Lung stood tall, arms crossed behind his back, overlooking a map of the world spread across the table. Yet his mind was far from topics at hand. His thoughts, as they often were these days, were with his son. In all the Fire Nation, perhaps in all the world, Admiral Lung felt he was the luckiest and proudest man alive. His son, Tai Lung, had turned out to be beyond exceptional…no, beyond anything the Fire Nation had ever seen. A prodigy among prodigies. At only twelve years old, Tai had defeated the Fire Lord, one of the strongest bending grandmasters in the entire nation. And it wasn't a desperate victory, nor was it hard-fought, it was one-sided. Flawless Victory. Still, even pride had its limits, and Admiral Lung knew the dangers of keeping someone like Tai Lung too close to the political heart of the Fire Nation. The capital was full of ambitious and jealous eyes. So he had sent his son away, on a ship, under the pretense of a global journey to broaden his horizons and participate in the war effort. That much was true, but there was more to it. It would allow Tai to grow, to gain the respect and merit he deserved from every corner of the world, and more importantly, to avoid the internal strife that could have one day seen him killing his own countrymen or being turned into a pawn by lesser minds. To ensure Tai wouldn't face those challenges alone, Admiral Lung had appointed Han as vice-captain and advisor, an experienced and loyal soldier and friend who had served along him and under him for many years. The admiral trusted Han with his son's life, and he had instructed him to send regular reports about Tai Lung's condition, progress, and decisions. And the letters… the letters had painted a portrait that surpassed even the admiral's lofty expectations. Between the letters from Tai himself, Han's careful updates, and the formal reports from Fire Nation outposts, the picture was clear. Tai Lung was carrying himself not only with power but with dignity and honor. He punished lawbreakers among their ranks, spoke out against injustice even when it put him at odds with other officers, and never hesitated to help those in need, citizens and soldiers alike. Some on the Fire Lord's council scoffed at his conduct, calling it foolish idealism. But they were powerless to stop him. Because Tai Lung's actions upheld the honor of the Fire Nation, an ideal those same council members merely paid lip service to. Admiral Lung's gaze drifted across the room toward the Fire Lord, seated a short distance away at the council table. Even now, Admiral Lung could not look at him without remembering that disgraceful Agni Kai. Since that day, the Fire Lord had lost much of his former prestige. His long, signature hair, once a symbol of strength and lineage, had been shorn as tradition dictated for the loser of an Agni Kai. Now, two years later, his dark hair has barely reached his shoulders. The humiliation was permanent. Were it not for General Iroh's firm refusal to claim the throne, Ozai's rule of the Fire Nation would have shattered under the weight of that shame. Admiral Lung didn't gloat, but neither did he pity the man. He had brought it on himself. Admiral Lung turned back toward the map, thoughts of Tai rising once more. The reports of his son's achievements had grown in number and significance. Though Tai had yet to see the front lines, his name carried weight now. He had defeated pirates, destroyed Southern Water Tribe raiders, dismantled rogue earthbender groups masquerading as freedom fighters, and protected Fire Nation merchants and colonies wherever he went. Wherever Tai Lung stepped, order followed. Peace was restored. Problems were solved. And with each new tale of triumph, Admiral Lung saw the looks from the other officers and council members. Their pride was painted thinly over a layer of envy. They smiled and offered congratulations, but the gleam in their eyes told another story. Tai Lung was his son, and no one could take that from him. He thought of Prince Zuko, who had only just begun attending these meetings, still fumbling through the formalities. In contrast, his son had already amassed more merit than captains who had served for decades. The difference was stark. And it was undeniable. Admiral Lung let a small smile cross his usually stoic features. [Let them envy. Let the world watch. My son was coming, and greatness followed him like a shadow.] As Admiral Lung was still savoring the thought of his son's soaring reputation, the heavy doors of the council chamber creaked open. A messenger stepped forward, his armor stained with dust from travel, his breathing quick but controlled. \"My Lords,\" he said, bowing low, \"news from the Zaofu front.\" Admiral Lung straightened slightly. Zaofu? That was the latest major maneuver, ten thousand Fire Nation soldiers had been sent through the treacherous Zaofu Mountain Range in a bold attempt to reach and strike Omashu from an unexpected angle. The plan had been daring, even brilliant, on paper. But something in the messenger's tone made the admiral 's stomach tighten. The young man continued. \"General Chen led the assault force into the mountains… but there he was ambushed by King Bumi and three thousand earthbenders. The mountains themselves were turned against us. The tops collapsed, entire cliffs brought down upon our men. Nearly half the army was either killed outright. The remaining five thousand, many of them wounded, are now trapped. Encircled. King Bumi decided… to take his time. He planned to slowly kill them out without risking his own forces.\" Gasps and murmurs filled the room. Faces hardened, jaws clenched. This was a staggering loss. Then, with a roar of flame, the fire curtain in front of the Fire Lord surged upward, roaring into the ceiling. His fury was palpable. \"Speak,\" the Fire Lord ordered, voice razor-sharp. \"There is more.\" The messenger bowed lower. \"Yes, my Lord. General Shinu believed King Bumi would not stop at that. He has requested reinforcements be sent to defend the coastal fortress. He believes Bumi will seize the opportunity and strike them once he eliminates General Chen.\" Nods of agreement came from several council members. Admiral Lung remained silent as he thought about it. It was a calculated, cautious move. Reinforce the fortress. Abandon the soldiers. A cost-of-war decision. Strategic. Cold. Expected. But the messenger's face twitched as he continued, and Admiral Lung felt a chill. \"Captain Tai Lung's ship arrived at the fortress during this time,\" the messenger said. \"General Shinu ordered him to assist in defending the fortress.\" He hesitated, then added, \"Captain Lung disagreed.\" There was a pause. \"Disagreed?\" someone murmured. The messenger swallowed. \"He refused the order… and attacked General Shinu. He imprisoned the general in a cell beneath the fortress.\" Silence fell. Complete and deafening. A captain attacking and imprisoning a general? Admiral Lung's brow furrowed, a flicker of disbelief crossing even his face. It was unprecedented. Never in the Fire Nation's long, disciplined history had such a thing occurred. The fire curtain exploded again, more violently this time, as several ministers stood in protest. \"Treason!\" one cried. \"Mutiny!\" said another. Outrage echoed across the room like thunder. But Admiral Lung raised a hand, his voice calm but cold as steel. \"Enough,\" he said. \"Continue. What happened next?\" The messenger blinked but obeyed. \"Captain Lung took five hundred soldiers and led a mission into the mountains. He moved quickly… decisively. And he succeeded. He saved most of the trapped troops, striking hard at the enemy forces. In the process, hundreds of earthbenders were killed and… Captain Tai Lung heavily injured King Bumi. He nearly killed him.\" A hush swept across the room once again. Eyes widened. Whispers started and died in the throats of generals and lords alike. \"Heavily injured King Bumi?\" one minister breathed. The messenger nodded. \"Yes. But during the battle, Captain Lung struck a deal. To secure safe withdrawal and ensure the lives of our soldiers, he agreed to spare King Bumi's life and promised the enemy that he will never participate in another attack against Omashu personally.\" The audience were stunned into silence. Admiral Lung himself felt a complicated mix of awe and disbelief. A promise made in battle? Sparing the legendary king? And in the face of impossible odds, he had saved thousands. After a moment of silence, General Iroh who had been listening spoke up with a warm yet commanding voice \"Is there anything else?\" The messenger nodded. \"Yes, General. Captain Lung is refusing to release General Shinu. He has requested the general be tried for treason.\" A third wave of silence slammed into the chamber. First, he struck a general. Then, he jailed him. Now, he wanted him tried. A captain doing all this? The audacity alone was unbelievable. But then, one by one, the council members recalled another memory, one not so long ago, of a twelve-year-old boy humiliating the Fire Lord in Agni Kai, unshaken by status or consequence. Suddenly, none of it felt out of place. It was simply Tai Lung.\n\nThe golden rays of morning filtered through the windows of the Fire Nation High Command, casting a regal glow over the war room. Admiral Lung stood tall, arms crossed behind his back, overlooking a map of the world spread across the table. Yet his mind was far from topics at hand.

The admiral trusted Han with his son's life, and he had instructed him to send regular reports about Tai Lung's condition, progress, and decisions.\n\nTo ensure Tai wouldn't face those challenges alone, Admiral Lung had appointed Han as vice-captain and advisor, an experienced and loyal soldier and friend who had served along him and under him for many years.

Tai Lung was carrying himself not only with power but with dignity and honor. He punished lawbreakers among their ranks, spoke out against injustice even when it put him at odds with other officers, and never hesitated to help those in need, citizens and soldiers alike. Some on the Fire Lord's council scoffed at his conduct, calling it foolish idealism. But they were powerless to stop him. Because Tai Lung's actions upheld the honor of the Fire Nation, an ideal those same council members merely paid lip service to.\n\nBetween the letters from Tai himself, Han's careful updates, and the formal reports from Fire Nation outposts, the picture was clear.

Even now, Admiral Lung could not look at him without remembering that disgraceful Agni Kai. Since that day, the Fire Lord had lost much of his former prestige. His long, signature hair, once a symbol of strength and lineage, had been shorn as tradition dictated for the loser of an Agni Kai. Now, two years later, his dark hair has barely reached his shoulders. The humiliation was permanent. Were it not for General Iroh's firm refusal to claim the throne, Ozai's rule of the Fire Nation would have shattered under the weight of that shame.\n\nAdmiral Lung's gaze drifted across the room toward the Fire Lord, seated a short distance away at the council table.

Though Tai had yet to see the front lines, his name carried weight now. He had defeated pirates, destroyed Southern Water Tribe raiders, dismantled rogue earthbender groups masquerading as freedom fighters, and protected Fire Nation merchants and colonies wherever he went. Wherever Tai Lung stepped, order followed. Peace was restored. Problems were solved.\n\nAdmiral Lung turned back toward the map, thoughts of Tai rising once more.

            "content": "It had been two years since the Agni Kai that shook the Fire Nation. Two years since the Fire Lord, bearer of the crown and symbol of unmatched power and divine rights, had been brought to his knees by a boy no older than twelve. A boy named Tai Lung. And now, that name echoed once more across the capital, spoken in awe, whispered in admiration, shouted in celebration. This time, the boy had not only dueled a king, but defied a system. He had disobeyed direct orders, imprisoned a commanding general, and marched five hundred men into a death trap. All to rescue thousands of soldiers who had been left to die in the Zaofu Mountain Range. And against all odds… he succeeded. Now, they called him more than a prodigy. They called him a war hero. An honorable soldier who placed his comrades above politics and position. A man who risked his life and future to save his brothers-in-arms. Letters poured into the capital, not from nobles or generals, but from mothers and fathers. From wives and sisters. From children who could still call their fathers by name because of what Tai Lung had done. Many of those letters found their way to Admiral Lung's household. And every one of them was read by both the Admiral and his wife. They filled the house with a quiet, overwhelming pride. A pride that had no room for vanity or arrogance. Their son was something else. Something rare. Something meant for greatness. And today, after two long years, he was coming home. At the docks, Admiral Lung stood tall and composed as always, his expression calm, but in his eyes, fire and joy danced together. Beside him, his wife barely hid her excitement. Her hands fidgeted at her sides, her eyes scanned the horizon, and her foot tapped with impatience. The moment she saw Tai Lung's ship arrive, her breath hitched. She was practically glowing. The vessel docked, and the gangplank lowered with a creak of wood and rope. And then, he appeared. Tai Lung. Taller now, his shoulders broader, his steps steady with confidence and power. His presence had matured. His gaze sharper, posture refined but still, unmistakably, their son. He spotted them. A smile broke across his face. He moved to bow in greeting, but his mother rushed forward, arms already reaching. Admiral Lung wasn't far behind. \"No bowing,\" his mother said as she wrapped him in a fierce hug, voice cracking with emotion. \"We missed you so much.\" Tai Lung laughed softly, returning the embrace with both arms. \"I missed you, too.\" With no ceremony, just smiles and soft words, the family of three returned to their home. The evening that followed was warm and easy. His mother took up most of the conversation, urging him to retell the stories he'd mentioned in his letters. What were the pirate raids really like? What did Kyoshi Island really look like? And what exactly did King Bumi say after being defeated? Tai Lung humored her questions with patience and respect, speaking modestly, letting her excitement carry the tone. And all the while, Admiral Lung sat quietly across from them with a cup of warm tea in hands. He said little. But his smile, subtle and proud, never left his face. His son had returned. And he was more than anything he had ever hoped he would be. ___________ The palace burned with tension and from fury. A suffocating heat emanated not from the hearths or lanterns across the palace, but from the Fire Lord himself. His rage was silent, coiled and controlled. But within, it churned like magma. That insolent boy. It had been two years since the disgraceful Agni Kai, since a twelve-year-old defeated him in front of nobles, guards, and the eyes of the nation. He had endured the humiliation then because he had no choice. Meanwhile, the boy had left the capital and wandered freely ever since, and the Fire Lord, Fire Lord Ozai, could not touch him. Not without cause. Not without risking another devastating blow to his already fractured image. The loss had scarred his rule. Many officers, nobles, even commoners whispered in secret: that it should've been Iroh who ruled. That Ozai lacked the strength, the composure, the honor. Thankfully, his brother was a fool, too loyal to a dead man's supposed will to stake his claim. But the boy, Tai Lung... the boy was different. Ozai had considered smearing the child's name. Painting him as aimless, dishonorable and lacking duty. But wherever Tai Lung went, he improved the Fire Nation standing. He solved conflicts, helped villages, rooted out corruption. He earned respect from soldiers and civilians alike, not through power alone, but with action and results. Now, the boy was being called a hero. And worse, he had just committed mutiny, openly disobeying General Shinu, attacking him, and imprisoning him in his own fortress. It was an unforgivable breach of the chain of command. Yet instead of being condemned, Tai Lung was celebrated. He had led a daring rescue into Zaofu Range, saved thousands of soldiers, and even defeated the legendary earthbender King Bumi in battle. The council chamber now whispered about promoting him to General. To Admiral. To anything. Ozai's fury flared at the thought. [Promote him? That boy would become a permanent threat. a symbol of defiance to his rule.] No. The Fire Lord's hands clenched. He would not tolerate adding another high-ranking officer to oppose his will, and one standing proudly with the people behind him. But what else can he do? assassins? Useless. The boy had become a monster. A blue-flamed monster. He would not fall easily, if at all. Then, like a faint breeze breaking a heated silence, came an unexpected knock. His war minister entered the chamber with calm and confidence, his robes rustling against the polished floor. Beside him stood Princess Azula. She was asked by the minister to follow him to meet her father. Ozai's sharp eyes narrowed with interest. \"I may have a plan,\" the minister said. \"To restore your prestige, my lord… and ensure Admiral Lung's loyalty to the royal family.\" His words got the full attention of the Fire Lord, even Azula looked at the minister with interest, curious about what he was going to say next. \"I believe having a union between princess Azula and Tai Lung is a solution to the royal family trouble\" The minister spoke with no reservations. Azula's face twisted in shock then anger, she spoke with a voice sharp with disbelief. \"Union!! This is ridiculous. After everything he did to Father, you want me to marry him?\" The war minister remained composed. \"Yes, Princess. Tai Lung has shown himself to be bound by honor and virtue. If the two of you were united, the enmity between him and the Royal Family would dissolve. Your union would strengthen the throne, and your father's name would once again be held in reverence.\" Azula scowled. \"I don't need him. I've been training hard. One day, I will definitely defeat him.\" She raised her hand, and a flickering stream of blue fire erupted from her palm. \"I can create blue fire like him now. Once I master it fully, I'll move on to lightning.\" The minister nodded. \"There is no doubt of your greatness, Princess. And that is why the two of you are well matched. When your time comes, who in this nation will be worthy of you? The only one who has unlocked blue fire aside from you, Tai Lung.\" He stepped closer. \"And imagine… the union of two such prodigies. It could birth a new generation the likes of which the Fire Nation has never seen.\" Azula's fire slowly died out. Her hand lowered. She had trained for years, fueled by the desire to surpass Tai Lung. She had envisioned standing over him in victory. But now, as the minister spoke, a new thought struck her. Who else but him could stand beside her as an equal in the future? Even if they were to marry, it didn't mean she couldn't outshine him in time. She would surpass him one day. She would be the greatest firebender of this era. Her golden eyes turned toward her father. \"I will follow your orders,\" she said. \"What should I do?\" Fire Lord Ozai's face, at last, broke into a satisfied gleam. A glint of cruel amusement danced in his eyes. \"We will proceed,\" he said coldly. \"With the minister's suggestion.\" ___________ Back in the Lung household, Tai sat with his parents in the main room, a cup of freshly brewed tea warming his hands as he answered another question from his ever-curious mother. But just as he relaxed into the rhythm of home, his parents exchanged a glance, one that made room pause for a second. Admiral Lung set his cup down, his face as calm and composed as ever, while his mother leaned forward, an excited sparkle in her eyes. \"Tai Lung,\" she began, her tone strangely formal, \"there's something we've been meaning to talk to you about.\" He tilted his head, sensing the shift. \"Is something wrong?\" \"No, no,\" she said quickly, shaking her head. \"Quite the opposite. It's… something new.\" Admiral Lung nodded. \"You've grown, son. Not just in strength or in the eyes of the public, but in age as well. You're fourteen now. A young man.\" Tai Lung blinked, unsure where this was going. \"Okay...?\" \"That means,\" his mother cut in with a mischievous smile, \"you're of age to begin thinking about a partner.\" He froze. \"A… what?\" His father's expression didn't change, but he added, \"You've received marriage offers, Tai Lung. From noble families.\" The cup nearly slipped from his hand. \"What?\" \"It's not unusual,\" his mother said, laughing at his stunned expression. \"Given your reputation, your accomplishments, your name, many have taken notice. Their daughters, especially.\" Tai Lung opened his mouth to respond, but nothing came out. He was still reeling. \"You don't have to choose anyone right now,\" Admiral Lung said gently, \"but it's time to start thinking about it. You are old enough. We have stashed all the proposals you have received in your room\" His mother leaned back with a satisfied smile. \"We thought it would surprise you.\" It certainly had.

            "content": "Tai Lung sat alone in his room expressionlessly as he stared at the flickering lantern hanging from the ceiling. In his past life, he had lived solely for Kung Fu and to make his father proud, his only dream is to become the Dragon Warrior, it consumed his every breath. He had no friends, no lover, never even considered such thoughts. And now, even after living in this new world for fourteen years, he still found himself empty. No dreams. No long-term aspirations. Yes, he wanted to regain his strength and rise even higher. He wanted to master firebending. But he was already considered the strongest in the world. What was there beyond reaching the top? There was nothing. He was merely honoring his parents' wishes, and living by the teachings he once abandoned. That was the extent of it. He was still the same aimless person born fourteen years ago. His eyes drifted to the desk on the other side of his room. A box sat on it, filled with sealed letters and scrolls, engagement proposals from noble families across the Fire Nation. Tai Lung frowned. What experience did he have in such matters? Did he even care? The answers were simple: none and he didn't care. In this world, leaving behind teachings and students didn't count as a complete legacy, only lineage through blood was. In his nation's customs, his duty to his parents was to ensure their name lived on, that their bloodline continued through him. Sure, he can do that, but who was he supposed to choose? He didn't know most of these families. He didn't know their daughters, and barely registered any of their sons. Tai Lung sighed heavily. This was going to be more difficult than expected. As he sat pondering, a servant knocked on the door. \"Sir, you have visitors,\" the servant said with a respectful bow. Tai Lung rose to his feet, his curiosity piqued. Visitors? Perhaps Han… or someone else from his crew? He walked down the hall toward the guest area. As he stepped inside, he immediately spotted two familiar figures. Ty Lee and Mai. Ty Lee's eyes gleamed with excitement. She rushed forward, throwing her arms around him in a tight hug. \"It's been so long! How could you not write to us!!\" Mai, standing a few steps behind her, spoke in her usual calm tone. \"I didn't mind you not writing… but it's nice to see you back. And safe.\" Tai Lung blinked in surprise, not at Ty Lee's hug, but at Mai's words. He looked at her curiously. \"It seems you've grown while I was away.\" Ty Lee laughed as Mai raised a brow. \"I'm already regretting coming here.\" The trio settled into easy conversation. Well, mostly Ty Lee talking about herself, Mai, the academy and asking Tai Lung about his life and travels, Mai joined in with her deadpan commentary from time to time. They eventually made their way outside to the courtyard. Ty Lee insisted on showing off her new tricks and acrobatics. She moved with agility and grace, then suddenly shifted into combat poses, demonstrating her newly-learned chi blocking techniques. \"I started learning chi blocking after your Agni Kai two years ago,\" she said, beaming with pride. Tai Lung watched carefully, impressed. She was easily the best hand-to-hand combatant he'd seen in this world. Her only real flaw was her physical weakness, but with time and if she learned to empower herself with chi, she could stand among the strongest in the world. He didn't hesitate to praise her, and Ty Lee's smile grew even wider at his words. After a while, Mai brought up the one topic troubling Tai Lung. \"At the Royal Academy of Girls, a lot of them talk about their parents sending engagement proposals… to you.\" Tai Lung nodded. \"I received many.\" \"Did you choose one?\" Mai asked. Tai Lung shook his head. \"Didn't even check them. There's no point. I don't know any of them and I barely register their names.\" He gave a casual shrug. \"I barely know any girls in person anyway.\" He paused, his gaze drifting to Mai, then to Ty Lee, before focusing on the latter. His expression turned thoughtful. Ty Lee tilted her head. \"Is something wrong?\" \"Are you engaged to anyone?\" Tai Lung asked bluntly. \"If not, then why don't we get engaged?\" Both girls were stunned. Ty Lee blushed furiously, her words stumbling out. \"Wh-Why all of a sudden?\" Tai Lung's tone remained calm and practical. \"I'm supposed to choose someone. You're among the few I know. We get along. We share similar interests. Your family is good. You look good. You're the best choice I see.\" Ty Lee's face was burning now. She opened her mouth but no words came out. Mai finally spoke with a curious tone. \"What about me? Or Azula?\" Tai Lung replied without hesitation. \"Your personality and interests are completely different from mine. As for Azula, I haven't seen her in a long time, I have a bad history with her father, and last I checked she disliked me. Ty Lee is undoubtedly the best choice I have.\" He looked at Ty Lee. \"So, what do you think?\" Ty Lee blinked rapidly. \"I… I need to think about it. You can't just say something like that and expect an answer right away!\" \"Not really,\" Tai Lung shrugged. \"It's a simple yes or no. If you think it's worth a try, then you try. That's it.\" Ty Lee was stunned by his bluntness. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, then whispered, \"Yes.\" Tai Lung gave a short nod. \"I'll let my parents know,\" he said, then turned and walked off. Mai turned to Ty Lee. \"As carefree as you are, I never imagined your engagement proposal would happen like this. It feels wrong with how casual and blunt it was.\" Ty Lee was still blushing furiously, staring off in the direction Tai had gone. She couldn't believe it. Her friend had just proposed to her… and she said yes. All of it happened out of nowhere. ___________ When Tai Lung abruptly announced his choice of engagement is Ty Lee, and even more surprisingly added that he already asked her and she had agreed, it left both his parents stunned. His mother and father sat across from him in the sitting room, mouths slightly open, processing the news. \"That was... unusually fast,\" his mother said slowly, exchanging a look with Admiral Lung. \"You've only just returned, and you're already selecting one\" Tai Lung nodded with his usual calm demeanor, before leaving. Admiral Lung crossed his arms, his eyes narrowing. \"What do you think made him think she was the one? His selection was rather fast, too fast. He basically proposed to the first girl he saw. Selecting a partner is not like buying the first cabbage you see, maybe I should talk to him and make sure he understands what he is committing himself to.\" Tai Lung's mother laughed and said. \"I am not surprised it was her, he knew her the longest after all. That girl used to come here all the time when they were kids. Tai even turned her into a training junkie. Had her doing drills, flipping through the garden and some other things they called training.\" Admiral Lung blinked, clearly caught off guard. \"He did what?\" It was his first time hearing about that. \"Well,\" his wife continued with a nod of approval, \"it's good he's taking responsibility for that. If anyone was going to marry the girl, it may as well be the boy who put her on this path.\" Admiral Lung looked at her, clearly unsure what to say, and just sighed. \"Right... of course.\" ___________ Despite his initial surprise, Admiral Lung wasted no time in making the engagement official. Within the day, he arranged for a formal visit to Ty Lee's family home. It was during this visit that Tai Lung discovered something entirely new and utterly bewildering about his new fiance. Ty Lee was one of seven identical sisters. He met them all that day: Ty Lin, Ty Lat, Ty Lao, Ty Liu, Ty Lum, and Ty Woo. All of them stared at him with the same wide, curious eyes, the same bubbly energy, the same mischievous grins. For a moment, Tai Lung thought his vision was failing him. How could there be seven of her? For fourteen years, Tai had assumed humans usually had one, maybe two children at most and even that was rare in this world. But seven? He was speechless. It was a loud, jarring reminder that there was still a lot he didn't know about this world. As if that wasn't enough, the sisters decided to play a joke on him. They lined up in front of him and giggled. \"If you're going to marry our sister,\" one said, \"you should be able to find her.\" \"Pick the real Ty Lee,\" another added with a wink. Tai Lung narrowed his eyes, scanning them. Their appearances were identical, but Tai Lung focused not on their faces, but their bodies, their stances, their energy. And there it was. A subtle difference in posture, in the way one of them bounced slightly on the balls of her feet, her breathing a touch more measured than the rest. He pointed without hesitation. \"That one.\" The girls blinked. Ty Lee stepped forward, a wide smile blooming across her face. \"You got it!\" The sisters regrouped and shuffled places. \"Again!\" They repeated the game, three, four, five times, and each time, Tai Lung found her effortlessly. The others eventually gave up, laughing in defeat. Ty Lee's joy was evident, genuine and uncontainable. Her eyes sparkled as she looked at him, clearly moved by how easily he had distinguished her from the others. She wasn't just another face in a matching set to him. And that meant more to her than Tai Lung knew.\n\nTai Lung sat alone in his room expressionlessly as he stared at the flickering lantern hanging from the ceiling. In his past life, he had lived solely for Kung Fu and to make his father proud, his only dream is to become the Dragon Warrior, it consumed his every breath. He had no friends, no lover, never even considered such thoughts. And now, even after living in this new world for fourteen years, he still found himself empty. No dreams.

            "content": "In the wide courtyards of the Royal Academy for Girls, Princess Azula walked with her usual confident stride. Her eyes scanned the open space until they landed on her two closest companions, Mai and Ty Lee, sitting under the shade of a cherry blossom tree. From afar, Azula could already tell something was unusual. Ty Lee was wearing the widest smile Azula had ever seen on her. She was practically glowing, chatting with more energy than usual with Mai, who, for her part, looked both amused and faintly exasperated. Intrigued, Azula approached. \"What did I miss that made you extra happy today?\" she asked as she came to a stop beside them. Ty Lee finally noticed her and gasped with delight. \"Azula!\" she chirped, reaching out and grabbing the princess's hands excitedly. Mai glanced over and said, deadpan, \"You won't believe it.\" Azula raised a brow, curiosity piqued. \"Try me.\" Still holding her hands, Ty Lee practically bounced in place. \"I'm engaged!\" Azula blinked. \"Really? When? I just saw you yesterday.\" Ty Lee nodded enthusiastically. \"I know! It was sudden. All of it was done yesterday.\" Mai added dryly, \"The fastest proposal and answer I've ever heard of.\" Azula was clearly surprised, her expression momentarily faltering before she composed herself. \"Well… congratulations,\" she said with a smile. \"So who's the lucky guy?\" Ty Lee's grin widened. \"Tai Lung.\" Azula froze. \"As in Admiral Lung's son?\" she asked slowly, her voice slightly weaker than usual. Ty Lee nodded brightly. \"Yep!\" Azula was beyond shocked. Her mind reeled. \"How…?\" Ty Lee began to explain, still caught in the high of the memory. \"Yesterday, Mai and I went to visit him, you know he was away for two years. And then out of nowhere, he proposed! Just like that! I said yes, and by evening, Admiral Lung came to my house and everything was made official.\" She giggled. \"Tai Lung is my fiance now.\" Azula gave a small nod. \"So that's why you're happy.\" Ty Lee shook her head. \"Not exactly.\" She leaned closer, eyes sparkling. \"Last night, my sisters and I decided to play a little joke on him, since we're seven identical sisters. We lined up and asked him to pick me out.\" Azula blinked, she knew how impossible it was to find Ty Lee among her sisters. Ty Lee went on, dreamy-eyed. \"He got it right away. Every single time. He had no doubt as he signaled me out. Even my parents can't tell us apart, but Tai Lung could. Like it was nothing. It was… I don't know. It just made me feel so special.\" Azula forced a smile, keeping her face perfectly composed. To both Mai and Ty Lee, her reaction was understandable. Anyone would be surprised at such a sudden engagement. It was sudden, after all, and not to mention the bad history between her family and Tai Lung. But what they didn't know was that Azula had plans. She had been planning to approach Tai Lung later today. Not out of affection, Azula didn't waste her time on that, but because of what the Minister had said: Tai Lung was the ideal candidate. The son of an admiral, a prodigy in his own right, and one of, if not, the strongest benders in this era. She was the princess and she deserved only the best of everything, including her future partner. And her father's orders had only made her more determined. And now… he was engaged. To Ty Lee. Azula listened as Mai and Ty Lee chatted on about the engagement, how Tai Lung had apparently always viewed Ty Lee as the right choice. Every word stung. Every laugh Ty Lee gave felt like a slap. She was the princess. She was the prodigy. And yet Tai Lung had proposed to the girl who could do cartwheels and handstands. Her pride felt hurt, especially when she remembered she was going to initiate the contact with Tai Lung. The anger and bitterness boiled inside her like a pot on the verge of spilling. A flame of competitiveness roared to life. Still smiling sweetly, she tilted her head and asked with feigned concern, \"Are you sure Tai Lung is the right person for you, Ty Lee?\" Ty Lee blinked in surprise. \"What do you mean?\" Azula kept her voice gentle, almost sisterly. \"He's a firebending prodigy, and usually, firebenders look for partners with strong bending potential to strengthen their bloodline. What if he changes his mind? Or what if his parents pressure him to?\" Ty Lee froze, the joy draining slightly from her face. Mai's eyes narrowed. \"Tai Lung is not the kind of person who cares about that,\" Mai said firmly. \"And his father didn't hesitate to make things official.\" Ty Lee nodded slowly, smiling again, but this time the light in her eyes was a little dimmer, her enthusiasm slightly restrained. Azula gave a nonchalant shrug. But inside, she was smirking. ___________ Later that day, Ty Lee met with Tai Lung for their first official date as an engaged couple. She smiled brightly as they walked side by side. \"So,\" she asked playfully, \"do you have anything planned?\" Tai Lung looked ahead calmly. \"We'll eat at a nearby restaurant. After that, it's up to you, choose whatever you like.\" Ty Lee giggled. \"You're not very good with dates, are you?\" Tai shrugged. \"Never thought about them before. The first time I even asked what I was supposed to do… was today.\" He said it so plainly that Ty Lee couldn't help but smile more. \"I thought of picking a few things,\" he added, \"but then I decided against it. You can choose whatever you want to do for the rest of the day.\" \"Leave it to me to make it fun!\" she said, giving him a wink. They shared a quiet meal at a cozy restaurant, where Ty Lee did most of the talking and Tai Lung listened with occasional nods or questions. After eating, Ty Lee dragged him to go shopping, pointing at clothes and trinkets while Tai Lung followed without complaint. The day ended with them attending a small circus, Ty Lee's eyes sparkling with excitement while Tai Lung observed in silence. He didn't object to any part of it. By nightfall, Tai Lung was walking Ty Lee back to her home under the faint glow of lanterns. \"That was fun,\" Ty Lee said, smiling as she looked up at him. Tai Lung nodded. \"It was new.\" Ty Lee tilted her head. \"What counts as fun for you?\" \"Training,\" he replied simply. Ty Lee laughed. \"You haven't changed at all.\" But then her smile faded slightly, Azula's words from earlier echoing in her head. The insecurity crept in, and despite herself, she asked: \"Don't you mind me not being a firebender? Shouldn't you be looking for a firebender to continue your bloodline?\" Tai Lung blinked. \"Never really thought of that. I think you're good without being able to bend fire.\" Ty Lee froze. His first sentence struck something in her. He never thought of it? But he could, couldn't he? What if he changed his mind? Tai Lung noticed the change in her demeanor. \"What's wrong?\" Her gaze dropped. \"Noble families with strong firebenders… they usually choose partners who can also bend fire, to strengthen their line. I'm not a firebender.\" \"So?\" he asked, clearly confused. \"You should choose someone who can firebend… not me.\" Tai Lung's brows furrowed. \"That's a stupid way of thinking, why…\" \"You think I'm stupid?\" Ty Lee interrupted sharply, hurt flashing in her eyes. Tai Lung blinked. \"That's not what I said.\" But Ty Lee turned and ran, disappearing into the night before he could say anything else. He stood there, dumbfounded. [What was that? Did I say something wrong?] he thought. ___________ The next day at the Academy, Ty Lee walked in without her usual brightness. The change was immediately noticed by everyone, especially Mai and Azula. \"What's wrong?\" Mai asked. Ty Lee hesitated before relaying everything that had happened the day before. \"He said I was stupid,\" she mumbled. Azula raised an eyebrow, suppressing a smirk. \"He called you stupid?\" \"That's what it felt like,\" Ty Lee said softly. Azula folded her arms and feigned anger. \"How dare he. That's unacceptable.\" But Mai looked skeptical. \"It sounds like you're misunderstanding something.\" Azula gave her a pointed look. \"What's there to misunderstand? He called Ty Lee stupid.\" Ty Lee lowered her head further, her sadness deepening. The mood stayed the same for the rest of the day. When the Academy finally let out, the three girls walked out together, only to stop at the sight of Tai Lung standing outside the gates, holding a small bag in one hand. Ty Lee hesitated at first, but with Mai and Azula by her side, she slowly walked forward. Azula was the first to speak, voice sharp and confrontational. \"Are you here to apologize after calling Ty Lee stupid?\" Tai Lung looked at her calmly, then shifted his gaze to Ty Lee, who still refused to look at him. \"No,\" he said evenly. \"I'm not here to apologize. I didn't call her stupid. She interrupted me before I could finish and ran away.\" Azula narrowed her eyes. \"Trying to change your words now?\" Tai Lung ignored her. \"I think considering bloodlines just for firebending is stupid. I could beat the Fire Lord with the so-called divine bloodline without even needing to bend fire.\" Azula froze, eyes flashing with barely-contained fury. Ty Lee, meanwhile, looked up at him, startled. Tai Lung stepped forward and extended the bag toward her. \"But it seems you value this bloodline way of thinking,\" he said. \"So… these are martial arts scrolls. If you learn and master them, I'm sure you'll be stronger than most benders. A bloodline of martial arts for you, instead of firebending.\" Ty Lee blinked, stunned. Then she threw her arms around him. \"I'm so sorry,\" she whispered. \"I misunderstood you.\" Tai Lung rested a hand on her back. \"It's fine. Just… don't run off next time. Fighting in a war was easier than figuring out why you were upset\" Ty Lee laughed through a sniffle. \"It won't happen again.\" Azula stood there, silently glaring daggers at Tai Lung, but he didn't spare her another glance. Mai, meanwhile, smiled faintly, just a small amused curl of her lips.\n\nIn the wide courtyards of the Royal Academy for Girls, Princess Azula walked with her usual confident stride. Her eyes scanned the open space until they landed on her two closest companions, Mai and Ty Lee, sitting under the shade of a cherry blossom tree.

            "content": "The Fire Lord stood silently in his grand chambers, his robes billowing slightly from the breeze slipping in through the high windows. His expression was carved from stone, tight-lipped, cold-eyed, and utterly displeased. Just when he thought he was close to reclaiming control, just when the moment had come to rein Tai Lung in and recover the prestige he had lost in recent years, it had slipped through his fingers. The boy had gotten engaged to some random insignificant girl. A nonbender. A girl from a low-standing noble house. There was nothing remarkable about her, nothing special or strategic that could possibly justify such a match. Fire Lord Ozai had not even expected to win instantly. He had anticipated the need for a slow, deliberate approach. His daughter Azula was only beginning to prepare herself to confront and charm Tai Lung, to draw him into the fold as a useful weapon and potential consort. But that plan had failed before it could even begin. The boy's decision, this engagement, was foolish in Ozai's eyes. Even if not Azula, there had been dozens of better options. Girls from strong families. Firebenders. Bloodlines worthy of legacy. But he was Ozai, the Fire Lord. He would not accept such an outcome. He would not allow it. He turned from the shadows of his chamber and walked to the open window. With calm movements, he tied a letter to the leg of a waiting messenger hawk. His fingers were calm, but his eyes burned with resolve. He released the hawk into the sky, watching it disappear into the clouds. One way or another, things would go his way. ___________ Meanwhile, in the home of Admiral Lung, Tai Lung's parents sat quietly in their parlor. The room was warm with afternoon light, but the mood was mixed. The admiral's wife let out a long sigh. She looked weary. \"It's not that bad,\" Admiral Lung said gently, still smiling. She turned her eyes toward him, unimpressed. \"What kind of date is that supposed to be? He's training his fiance in martial arts instead of taking her out to relax and enjoy themselves.\" The admiral chuckled lightly. \"They seemed to be having fun. And you were the one calling them training junkies last week.\" \"I know,\" she said, shaking her head. \"But I can't help feeling sorry for her. Ty Lee's a sweet girl… and now she's spending her days sweating in the courtyard because of our son.\" ___________ In the courtyard, the air was filled with the sound of swift movements, light footsteps, and the occasional burst of laughter. Ty Lee moved like a whirlwind, striking with all the precision and speed she could muster. But Tai Lung was like a wall of wind, never quite in reach, always dodging with uncanny ease. Finally, breathless and panting, Ty Lee dropped to the ground, arms flopping behind her. \"You're way too strong and fast,\" she said with a tired laugh. Tai Lung sat beside her, his breathing barely elevated. \"I train a lot.\" Ty Lee turned to look at him, her cheeks flushed pink. For a moment, she hesitated, then said softly, \"Umm… Tai… would you like to try kissing?\" Tai Lung looked at her, noting the blush in her face. In his past life, kisses were not a common expression. It was something he'd never seen as animals of all species ignored it, or maybe never thought of it, most species' lips didn't help in that aspect anyway. Yet, here in this life, it seemed to hold more meaning. After a pause, he gave a small nod. Ty Lee closed her eyes and leaned in, her face burning red. Tai Lung stared at her a moment longer, then moved forward and gently pressed his lips to hers. The kiss lasted only a few seconds, soft and warm. When they pulled apart, Ty Lee looked like she might explode from embarrassment, completely crimson. Tai Lung, meanwhile, was deep in thought. He considered the sensation. Not unpleasant. His judgment: not bad. He looked at Ty Lee and smiled. That was all it took. With a squeak, Ty Lee leapt to her feet and bolted away, hands covering her face. Tai Lung blinked in confusion, left alone once more. If Ty Lee is upset, she runs away. If she's embarrassed, she also runs away. He sat back and exhaled, filing the observation in his mind with the rest of his martial knowledge. [Understanding a girl's mood is difficult.] was his final conclusion. ___________ The next day, the academy buzzed like usual. The trio of Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee were Sitting together on the grass during their break, Ty Lee beamed as she shared every detail of the previous day's training and what followed. Her cheeks were still pink as she recounted how Tai Lung had agreed to kiss her, how gentle he had been, how serious his eyes looked when he smiled. Mai listened with her usual distant expression, her mind elsewhere. She barely caught the tail-end of Ty Lee's sentence before glancing off toward the courtyard. A familiar thought crossed her mind, Would Zuko ever grow the courage to just ask her out. Azula, however, though she kept her face composed, couldn't fully contain her feelings. She laughed and teased Ty Lee like usual, but jealousy prickled beneath her skin. Tai Lung? That brute? That arrogant, ignorant, annoying Tai Lung? How could he be the one doing all the right things? How could he, of all people, treat Ty Lee so well? It irritated her more than she'd admit. As the bell rang and the three girls left the academy grounds, chatting and laughing, none of them noticed the looming figure standing in the shade of a building across the street. A giant of a man in a worn robe, with most of his face concealed by a hood. But what was visible, barely peeking out from the folds, was the strange tattoo on his forehead, an eye. Mai noticed him first. Her steps slowed as her instincts kicked in. The man tilted his head back slightly, then thrust it forward violently. Mai's eyes widened in a flash. \"JUMP!\" she screamed. The world exploded. A deafening boom rang out as fire and rubble burst where the girls had just been standing. The street cracked, and smoke swallowed the scene. People screamed in panic. The cloaked man didn't wait. He turned and walked away, his movements calm, as if assured his attack had succeeded. ___________ Hours passed before a messenger arrived at Admiral Lung's estate. The news was like a blade through the air. \"Lady Ty Lee has been injured,\" the messenger said grimly. \"There was an assassination attempt… on Princess Azula. The princess and her two friends were hurt.\" Admiral Lung's face darkened. Without wasting a second, he summoned his son. Tai Lung appeared moments later, and together they rushed to the Royal Medical Clinic. The clinic was a fortress of concern and activity. Royal guards stood at every corner. General Iroh, Zuko, and the families of the girls all waited anxiously in the outer chamber. The mood was tense, heavy. Admiral Lung stepped forward and approached General Iroh. \"What happened?\" he asked urgently. Iroh turned to face him, his kind face solemn. \"An assassin. A well-known one… We believe he was targeting Princess Azula. All three girls were injured in the attack.\" He paused before adding, \"Mai suffered light burns on her arm. Azula has some cuts and bruises… but the worst…\" Iroh sighed. \"Ty Lee stood directly between the assassin and the princess. She took the brunt of the blast. She is stable, but she will remain here for days.\" Silence fell over the group. Tai Lung said nothing at first, but his fists clenched at his sides. There was a low sound in the back of his mind. A voice warning him. The world is trying to take what is yours. Just like your destiny. You can't allow this. He felt his anger swelling, his control fraying. Still, his voice came out calm and low. \"What does this man look like?\" Both Admiral Lung and Iroh turned to him quickly, sensing something shift in the air. Heat radiated from Tai Lung's body. His stance was relaxed, but his eyes locked and burning with wrath and malice, they felt his presence turn wild and feral as if he was a wild beast. Iroh stiffened. Even Admiral Lung stepped back half a pace instinctively. Iroh hesitated to speak for a few moments, then relented under the weight of Tai Lung's malevolent gaze. \"He is tall. His limbs are mechanical, metal arms and legs. And… a tattoo of a third eye on his forehead.\" Tai Lung turned on his heel. \"Tai…\" Admiral Lung called after him. \"Where are you..?\" \"I'm going to rip that guy apart,\" Tai Lung said without turning back, his voice low and dangerous. \"And nothing you say will change that.\" Without another word, Tai Lung left the clinic.\n\nThe Fire Lord stood silently in his grand chambers, his robes billowing slightly from the breeze slipping in through the high windows.

            "content": "Tai Lung arrived at the Royal Academy for Girls just as the sun dipped behind the palace walls. The scent of soot and ash still hung in the air, the ground scorched and cracked from the earlier explosion. Tai Lung stood silently at the entrance, his golden eyes narrowing. He began rotating his chi, channeling energy through his body to sharpen every sense beyond human limits. He took a deep breath, inhaling deeply. Every scent, every particle in the air became vivid. His pupils contracted slightly. Then his gaze shifted, north. He moved. From street to street, corner to alley, Tai Lung followed the trail. The smell was faint but distinctive, metal, oil, smoke, and sweat. The target had tried to mask his path, looping through crowded districts and backstreets. But it wasn't enough. Not for Tai Lung. Eventually, his path brought him to the poorest and most neglected part of the Fire Nation capital. Here the streets narrowed, and the buildings leaned like drunks on one another. At the edge of one such alley sat a dimly lit bar, its wood rotting, its patrons rough and uncaring. This was a place of secrets and blood. Tai Lung stepped inside. Dozens of eyes turned to him. Some are curious. Some are wary. Some were drunk. He paid them no mind. His gaze swept the room, until it locked onto the far corner. Two men sat at a table. One was enormous, shoulders hunched beneath a ragged cloak. His hood had slipped just enough to reveal a distinctive tattoo, an eye, right on the forehead. Tai Lung took a step forward. His voice rang through the entire bar, cold and sharp like steel. \"Found you, vermin. I will rip you into pieces.\" The assassin narrowed his eyes, but didn't move. The tension exploded when a patron nearby rose from his stool, swaggering toward Tai Lung with a mocking grin. \"Listen here, buddy. This place…\" He never finished. Tai Lung extended a hand. A torrent of blue fire erupted, engulfing the man and reducing him to a charred corpse in an instant. Screams rang out as patrons scrambled away in horror. Tai Lung advanced, his eyes gleaming with unrestrained bloodlust. The assassin inhaled, then hurled a glowing energy blast straight at him. Tai Lung didn't flinch. He raised a hand and countered with a blast of his own, his flames burning an unnatural blue. The two attacks collided midair, a violent explosion rocking the bar. Glass shattered. Smoke filled the room. From the smoke… Tai Lung emerged. But now, he was growling like a beast. The assassin's eyes widened in surprise. He braced, but too late. Tai Lung dashed forward, faster than anything the assassin fought before. Despite that, he still threw a punch with his metal arm, but Tai Lung caught it mid-air with ease. His other leg kicked upward with monstrous force. The assassin flew back, crashing into the wall with a crack . In Tai Lung's hand was the man's metal arm, torn clean from his body. Tai Lung crushed it in his fist, metal warping and falling in pieces to the ground. Then his gaze shifted. To the other man at the table, the one who had been sitting with the assassin. The man trembled, eyes darting between Tai Lung and the money scattered on the table. \"It's…it's a misunderstanding,\" he stuttered, hands raised in defense. Tai Lung moved like lightning. His fist struck the man's chest with devastating force. Crack-crack-crack. The sound of bones shattering echoed through the room. The man was hurled into the wall, sliding down it limply. Blood flowed from his mouth, nose, and eyes. He didn't move. Chaos broke out behind Tai Lung. Screams, boots stomping. A group of men rallied, forming a line. Some fell into bending stances, others raised weapons. Their voices overlapped, all yelling the same thing: \"Stand down!\" \"Surrender now!\" \"You're outnumbered!\" Tai Lung turned slowly. His eyes were cold, filled with nothing but rage. He didn't care who these people were, he wasn't going to spare anyone. Not a single soul tied to this assassin even if remotely. ___________ The bar had fallen silent, reduced to a blood-soaked ruin. Broken bodies, scorched walls, shattered furniture, Tai Lung stood alone amidst it for only a moment longer, then turned and left. His footsteps were steady, not hurried. Minutes later, Fire Nation guards arrived, drawn by the screams and smoke that had filled the night. What they found stopped them cold. The moment they stepped inside, their expressions changed. Horror took hold. One guard, upon seeing the state of the corpses, clutched his stomach and vomited on the spot. The others stood frozen, eyes wide, struggling to comprehend the massacre before them. Meanwhile, Tai Lung had already returned to the Royal Clinic. His entire trip had taken a little over an hour. Inside, Admiral Lung and General Iroh stood speaking in hushed tones in one corner of the room. As soon as Tai Lung entered, both men turned to him. Their eyes dropped instantly to the blood staining his clothes. Admiral Lung stepped forward, voice firm yet edged with concern. \"Are you hurt?\" Tai Lung, now composed and calm, shook his head. \"It's not my blood.\" Iroh studied the young man, his brows furrowing. \"Did you find the assassin?\" he asked. \"I did,\" Tai Lung replied coolly. \"And the one who hired him. Both are dead.\" A deep, weary sorrow passed over Iroh's face. He had hoped the boy would show restraint. He didn't want to see another young soul devoured by hate, anger and vengeance. Admiral Lung, however, crossed his arms, his tone sharp with disapproval. \"You should have arrested them. There should have been a trial.\" Tai Lung's gaze turned cold. \"A trial would have saved them from a painful fate I wanted them to have.\" Admiral Lung's frown deepened. He opened his mouth to speak again but Tai Lung cut him off. \"Father, they are dead. This is the end of the matter.\" The admiral fell silent. He remembered the Agni Kai two years ago, how his son began behaving as if he was someone else, how he wanted to kill the Fire Lord. It was the same now but he was colder. Crueler. And that both frightened him and caused him concern. That night, Tai Lung sat in silence outside Ty Lee's room. The moon climbed and fell, and with it came the dawn. Ty Lee's eyes slowly opened, blinking against the morning light. She found herself bandaged with family surrounding her, her parents, her sisters all filled with relief. Their voices were soft and warm, welcoming her back with love. Soon, they invited Tai Lung inside. Together, they gently told her of the assassination attempt. Of how Azula had been the true target, and how Ty Lee had been caught in the blast, injured badly. Their words were careful, not too heavy. Tai Lung stood by the door, arms crossed. \"The assassin and his employer are both dealt with,\" he said simply, his tone steady and without detail. His words brought a wave of relief to Ty Lee's heart. Her body was weak, but her spirit lifted slightly. The danger was over, and in her mind, justice had been done. The attacker was caught. That was enough. Elsewhere, in a grand chamber deep within the Fire Nation palace, ministers and high-ranking officials gathered before the Fire Lord. The room was silent as a grim report was read aloud. It described the state in which the northern slum bar had been found. Sixteen bodies. All in unspeakable condition. Broken limbs. Skulls caved in. Limbs torn entirely off. Several bodies blackened and unrecognizable, burned alive. The worst among them, the report claimed, was believed to be the assassin responsible for the attempt on Princess Azula's life. His body was mutilated, limbs ripped apart, his head severed as if he was attacked by a wild ferocious beast. Another man was found in the same condition, identified as the assassin's employer. The ministers, seasoned veterans of war, paled as the words reached their ears. Some shifted uncomfortably in their seats, others looked disgusted. They had seen and heard of deaths before, but not like this. As for the employer, he had been identified as an ex-member of Azula's royal guard. Everyone believed he wanted revenge against the princess for some past grievance. No one thought too deeply into it, not after the unbelievable gory scene they found. General Iroh and Admiral Lung sat among them, and neither man could hide the shadow that passed over their faces. They knew who was responsible for this. The report, though clinical, painted an image in their minds of Tai Lung's wrath. Of what he became when provoked. A storm of unrestrained brutality. And above them, seated on his throne, the Fire Lord listened in silence. His face was hard to read, but his eyes darkened. This was not the news he had expected. Nor the news he had wanted, especially not after hearing of Ty Lee's survival.\n\nTai Lung arrived at the Royal Academy for Girls just as the sun dipped behind the palace walls. The scent of soot and ash still hung in the air, the ground scorched and cracked from the earlier explosion. Tai Lung stood silently at the entrance, his golden eyes narrowing.\n\nTai Lung arrived at the Royal Academy for Girls just as the sun dipped behind the palace walls.

            "content": "A week had passed since the supposed attempt on Princess Azula's life. The palace had returned to its usual rhythm, but tension lingered, thick and cold beneath the surface. In the Fire Lord's council chamber, news of Tai Lung's brutal slaughter in the northern slum bar had spread. What had first been a rumor now stood confirmed. The massacre, sixteen dead, bodies mangled and charred, was no longer something that could be ignored. The council was divided. Some officials stood firmly against Tai Lung, declaring his actions a clear violation of Fire Nation law. The man had taken justice into his own hands. Vigilantism, no matter the cause, was still a crime. Others, however, defended him fervently. Tai Lung had avenged both the Princess and his own fiance. His rage was righteous, they argued. His violence, justified. But the debate ended abruptly when General Iroh leaned forward and asked a single question. \"Who here is going to tell him he was wrong and must be punished?\" Silence fell like a guillotine. None of them dared to speak. Everyone remembered how Tai Lung had once insulted the Fire Lord himself and demanded an Agni Kai. How he had defied orders of his superiors, acted with mutiny and prevailed. The young man had power, and worse, the nerve to use it against anyone who stood in his way. And with the public calling him a hero, it became near impossible to touch him. Even Fire Lord Ozai, who loathed Tai Lung with every fiber of his being, remained silent. He knew better than to ignite a fire he couldn't contain. He had decided that no soul must know the truth of the assassination and Ty Lee is off limits. He was lucky this time Tai Lung had acted on his anger and killed indiscriminately without asking questions, but if this happens again, he might try to get into the bottom of the matter. In the end, the council came to a quiet, collective decision: Tai Lung was absurdly powerful, and dangerously bold. No one wanted to find out what would happen if he felt accused again. As for Tai Lung, he didn't know anything about the council nor did he care to know. He spent his days training and his evenings at the royal clinic, visiting Ty Lee. Her recovery had been quick, thanks to expert care and her natural vitality. And now, after an entire week, the time had come, the bandages were to be removed. He stood at her side. Ty Lee's parents were present, along with Azula and Mai. The atmosphere was hopeful, tense with anticipation. The medical staff moved carefully, unwrapping the last of the linen from Ty Lee's face and shoulder. Then they froze. Ty Lee blinked, noticing the sudden stillness in the room. \"What?\" she asked, confusion rising. \"What's wrong?\" No one answered. Fear took root in her chest. \"Give me a mirror,\" she whispered, dread blooming in her eyes. Her mother, hands shaking and eyes brimming with tears, reached into her bag and handed her a small mirror. Ty Lee looked. The reflection stared back, a long, jagged scar stretched from her right cheek down across her jawline, curling down her neck and disappearing beneath her robe. It was raw, pink, and deep. Her hands trembled. Then she screamed. The mirror hit the floor, shattering into pieces. Ty Lee buried her face in her mother's arms and wept uncontrollably. Her mother held her tightly, rocking her gently, crying with her. Azula, Mai, and Tai Lung left the room without a word. Out in the hallway, Azula's voice broke the silence. \"I knew the injuries might leave traces,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I never expected it to be that bad… to disfigure her.\" Mai, for once, looked visibly upset. Her arms crossed tightly, she shook her head. \"She didn't deserve this.\" Tai Lung said nothing. His eyes stared ahead, his expression unreadable. In truth, he didn't think the wound was that horrific. Yes, it scarred her face and was visible due to the lack of fur, but to him, it didn't change her that much. Still, he chose silence. He knew better than to voice that thought after seeing everyone's reaction. Some time later, Ty Lee's parents emerged from the room. Her mother's eyes were red, cheeks soaked in tears. Her father looked drained, his face pale and empty. Tai Lung approached them quietly. \"May I go in?\" he asked. They looked at him, worry and fear in their eyes. Her father opened his mouth to object, then sighed and gave a slow nod. Her mother hesitated. \"Please… she's been through a lot,\" she said softly. But her husband placed a hand on her arm and nudged her gently to move aside. Tai Lung walked past them, silent. Inwardly, he wondered [what did they think I was going to do to her?] He pushed the thought aside as he entered Ty Lee's room. Outside, Azula stood still, her arms crossed as a war brewed in her mind. Guilt gnawed at her, this was her fault. And yet, something selfish within her stirred, Tai Lung won't accept Ty Lee with a face like that. That selfish thought battled with her self-disgust. Mai said nothing. Her hands clenched tightly. And silently, she prayed to Agni that Tai Lung won't hurt her more. ___________ Tai Lung stepped quietly into the room. The light from the window stretched long across the floor, catching the fractured reflection of the mirror Ty Lee had thrown. She sat on the bed, her knees drawn up, her face buried in her hands, shoulders trembling with each sob. He closed the door behind him and spoke gently, his voice more subdued than usual \"How are you doing, Ty Lee?\" At the sound of his voice, Ty Lee turned her head away from him, covering her face as if to shield it from his eyes. Her voice broke as she spoke. \"My face is ruined,\" she whispered. \"I look like a monster.\" \"You don't,\" Tai Lung said without hesitation. \"Your face is fine.\" Ty Lee gave a hollow, bitter laugh, the sound muffled by her hands. \"I don't need you to try and make me feel better,\" she muttered. \"I saw it. No one will blame you if you want to call the engagement off.\" \"I'm not calling anything off, I see no reason to do that,\" Tai Lung said firmly. She lowered her head more, hands still covering her face. \"Just stop,\" she said. \"Tell me what you really think of my face.\" Tai Lung hesitated. The silence lingered too long for her. \"You can't say it,\" Ty Lee whispered, her voice trembling. \"I'm disgusting now.\" \"It's not that,\" Tai Lung replied at last, he found it hard to articulate an answer without making things worse. \"It's just... I don't think you'll like my answer.\" That only made her look away further, her whole body folding in on itself. Tai Lung sighed. \"Fine. I think you and everyone else are overreacting. It's just a scar, not a big deal.\" Ty Lee looked up at him for the first time since he entered. Her eyes were wide with disbelief, then narrowed with anger. \"Just a scar?\" she snapped. \"My face is ruined.\" \"I knew you wouldn't like my answer,\" Tai Lung said, his tone unchanging. \"I don't think your face is ruined. The scar's not that bad. And if anything, it's proof of your strength, that you survived. I truly don't understand what the big deal is about this. It not like you lost a limb\" Ty Lee stared at him. A war of emotions swirled in her eyes, anger, confusion, something close to relief. She didn't know how to feel. Should she be angry that Tai Lung seemed to care so little about her face? Or relieved that he genuinely didn't see her as disfigured and disgusting now? For a fleeting moment, she wondered if he was lying to make her feel better, but looking at him, at his calm, steady face, she could tell he was completely serious. Her breathing slowed. Some of the tension in her shoulders eased. \"You really don't hate how I look now?\" she asked softly. \"I don't,\" Tai Lung replied. \"I think it's fine. Besides, it's not like I proposed this engagement because your face had no scars.\" His voice took on a more irritated edge. \"And your parents and everyone else have been giving me strange looks the entire time, even though I didn't do or say anything. Seriously, it is just a scar! You all care way too much about skin condition.\" Ty Lee blinked at him. He looked more annoyed at being judged than concerned about the wound on her face. And somehow, that was the most comforting thing of all. She laughed a soft, sudden and genuine laugh. The first since her bandages had come off. Tai Lung glanced at her, slightly confused, but she shook her head, smiling through her tears. She had always known he acted and thought differently from everyone else… but she had never appreciated it more than now. ___________ When Ty Lee's family and friends learned of Tai Lung's reaction, they were relieved and happy for her. They were glad her fiance hadn't turned away from her, choosing instead to stay by her side despite her disfigurement. Even his own parents expressed their approval, with his father going so far as to say he was proud of him. As for Tai Lung, he remained genuinely puzzled by humans, even after living among them for fourteen years, some of their actions and worries continued to elude him.\n\nA week had passed since the supposed attempt on Princess Azula's life.

            "content": "A few days had passed since Ty Lee had been discharged from the royal clinic. Her body had healed completely, save for the scar that now marked her once-flawless face. Though the wound remained, her spirit had steadily recovered, and today she insisted on accompanying Tai Lung to one of the army's training grounds. Tai Lung had been assigned to help train new recruits under the command of his father, Admiral Lung. Surprisingly, Azula and Mai had decided to tag along. Despite being miss gloom and doom, Mai was concerned about Ty Lee's emotional state and simply wanted to be nearby in case she was needed. Azula, however, had a different motivation altogether. Her golden eyes remained fixed on Tai Lung, filled with a quiet fire. She had come with the sole intent of challenging him to a spar. Tai Lung, naturally, noticed the intensity of Azula's glare. But given how talkative Ty Lee was, ignoring Azula wasn't all that difficult. With Ty Lee by his side, Azula's silent challenge became background noise. The moment the four arrived at the training ground, they were greeted by Tai Lung's vice captain, Han. The experienced soldier walked up to him with a smile. \"It's been nearly a month, Captain. Heard you got engaged.\" Tai Lung gave a short nod and gestured to Ty Lee. \"This is Ty Lee, my fiance.\" Han turned toward her. His eyes lingered on the scar that traced her cheek before sliding away, though not quickly enough. Ty Lee noticed. She gave a strained smile in return. \"And these two,\" Tai Lung continued, pointing toward the others, \"are Mai and Azula.\" Han turned to them politely, but his expression shifted the moment he heard Azula. His gaze locked on her, and his eyes widened in realization. He immediately bowed low. \"We are honored to have you, Princess,\" he said with a sharp, respectful bow. Azula, who had begun to frown at how Tai Lung had introduced her last and without her title, now smiled at the satisfying display of deference. Han, meanwhile, cast a quiet glance toward his captain. [You dare to burn the Fire Lord and call him a fire rooster… but the rest of us? We'd suffer if we failed to show proper respect to the royal family.] Tai Lung noticed the unspoken grievance in Han's eyes but chose to ignore it. \"Where are the recruits?\" he asked. \"Please follow me,\" Han said, turning to lead them deeper into the camp. The four followed close behind until they reached an open ground. Thirty young men stood in formation, standing with nervous looks. \"Do they know how to firebend?\" Tai Lung asked. \"Do you know what kind of training they've been through?\" Han nodded. \"They're all firebenders, but their training only covered the basics. They haven't been taught any military tactics or advanced techniques.\" Tai Lung nodded, absorbing the information, but before he could speak further, Azula stepped forward. \"I think we should show the recruits what level they should aspire to,\" she said coolly. Tai Lung turned his gaze to her, but Han was the first to respond, speaking with an edge of formality. \"You are wise beyond your years, Your Highness,\" he said. Azula smiled. \"A spar between me and Tai Lung. We'll just throw fire at each other, nothing else.\" Han visibly hesitated. \"We… can't have you do that, Princess. I can spar with Captain Lung, if needed,\" he said weakly. The truth was, Han didn't want the princess to be humiliated by Tai Lung. The idea of the nation's princess being overwhelmed in front of new recruits was not something he could risk. This was not an Agni Kai, he had to prevent the spar or the blame would fall on his shoulders. Azula narrowed her eyes. \"Do you think this princess doesn't know how to spar?\" \"Of course not, Princess…\" Han faltered, then added with clear discomfort, \"It's just that sparring against the Captain…\" \"It's fine,\" Tai Lung cut him off casually. \"And you didn't need to make excuses. You could have said that before we got here. I knew you were up to something since you were glaring at me more than usual.\" Azula's eye twitched, while Ty Lee stifled a laugh. Mai, who rarely smiled, actually did. At once, the gathered soldiers moved, giving the two fighters ample space to spar. Azula stepped forward, eyes gleaming with focused challenge, promising pain with every glance. Tai Lung, on the other hand, remained completely relaxed. Han stood between the two firebenders, glancing back and forth with a worried face. He raised his hand and said firmly, \"If either one of you can't continue or if the fire causes harm the match is over.\" He cast a lingering glance at Tai Lung, silently hoping his captain would go easy on the princess. With that, Han stepped away to clear the field. Azula took her stance with disciplined grace, sharp and focused. Across from her, Tai Lung remained upright and relaxed, his hands by his side, his posture bordering on nonchalance. Azula narrowed her eyes. Without warning, she thrust her arm forward, only two fingers extended. From the tips burst a compact flame of brilliant blue, slicing through the air toward Tai Lung. He raised a brow and casually waved his arm, dispersing the fire on impact. \"Surprised?\" Azula asked with a smirk. \"You're not the only one who can do that.\" Tai Lung nodded with a neutral expression. \"Didn't expect blue fire from you.\" Azula's smile vanished. [Didn't expect it from me?] The words landed like a slap. Was that how he saw her? Did he not consider her a prodigy in her own right? Did he think she could never match someone like him? Her eyes burned with a fresh wave of fury as she launched another blast, and then another, streams of fire from her fingers arcing through the air toward him. Tai Lung, unmoving from his position, effortlessly batted away every flame, his palm cutting through her attacks with ease. Azula gritted her teeth. Her fist tightened, her thrusted with punches, her legs kicked, releasing ever-larger waves of flame. She increased her output, tried to alter her angles, her timing, but it made no difference. Tai Lung stood his ground, swatting away everything like a man fending off gnats. \"Are you not going to fight back?\" she snapped, her voice taut with frustration. \"It's a showcase for the recruits,\" Tai Lung replied evenly. \"No need for me to fight back.\" Azula growled, her fists trembling. \"Then show them what you can do…\" she snarled, \" instead of just defending!\" Tai Lung gave her a calm look. He thought for a moment. Perhaps it was time to remind everyone why they should respect him. Something to deter future annoyances. He gave a slight nod. \"Okay. Brace yourself.\" Azula's eyes narrowed. She inhaled sharply and sank into a defensive stance, her instincts suddenly on edge. Tai Lung stepped forward and threw a punch, not fast, but steady, and from it came a wave of fire. But not just a flame or a stream. It was a wall of fire, several meters wide, crashing forward like a tidal wave. Azula's eyes widened. Her breath caught in her throat as the fire roared toward her. [I'm going to die] she thought in that frozen instant. There was no blocking this, no dodging it, no countering. The soldiers and spectators around the field stood in horrified silence, watching the inferno speeding across the training ground. It looked as though it would swallow Azula whole and incinerate everything in its path. But the massive wall of fire missed its target. It passed right by Azula, mere inches away. She remained rooted to the spot, her limbs locked in place, unable to move or speak. The sheer fire turned her face and the ground around her a bright shade of blue from reflected light. Then it was gone. Azula dropped to her knees, shaking. She looked to her side, where the fire had scorched a long, blackened trail across the earth. Her mind was blank. Slowly, she turned her gaze back to Tai Lung. There was nothing left of her pride. The flame of competition within her was extinguished. There was no way she could match that. Ty Lee and Mai rushed to her side, their worry clear. Ty Lee placed a hand on Azula's shoulder while Mai knelt next to her. \"She's fine,\" Tai Lung said flatly. \"The fire passed by her harmlessly.\" Azula didn't respond. A long silence followed. Then, slowly, Azula rose to her feet. Her eyes didn't meet anyone else's. \"I'm going back to the palace,\" she said. \"I'm tired.\" She turned and began walking away, her steps unsteady. Mai and Ty Lee followed close behind, casting worried glances between each other and back at her. As they disappeared from view, Han approached Tai Lung with a shake of his head. \"You went overboard,\" he said quietly. \"You broke the princess.\" Tai Lung didn't seem remorseful. \"This way she won't annoy us too much if at all.\" Han snorted lightly, then asked, \"I hope you are right, I don't want to deal with royalty. So what do you think of her?\" \"At this rate?\" Tai Lung replied. \"She'll be a better bender than her father in a few years at most. She's the most talented fire bender I have seen, for sure.\"\n\nA few days had passed since Ty Lee had been discharged from the royal clinic. Her body had healed completely, save for the scar that now marked her once-flawless face.

            "content": "Azula sat in silence within the confines of her chambers, her gaze just staring at the space in front of her, her mind was far from the present. Her body no longer trembled, but inside, she was still shaking. She had been shaken to her very core. Never… not once… had she imagined a firebender could summon flames of such terrifying magnitude. It hadn't been just powerful, it had been absolute, a force of nature incarnate. No wonder her father lost to him. Fire Lord Ozai, once the most feared man in the Fire Nation, never stood a chance against that monster. In truth, no one in the Fire Nation did. As she slowly regained her composure, one thought took hold of her mind: she had to report this to her father. The spar was no longer a personal matter or a bruised ego. It was a warning sign. She knew just how deeply her father hated Tai Lung. Their relationship was bitter and cold. But now it was more than just personal conflict. It was a threat. She recalled the words Tai Lung spoke two years ago during the Agni Kai: 'change the ruling family' At the time, Azula had scoffed at the declaration, finding it too arrogant, even winning that Agni Kai didn't give him the ability to carry such a threat. But now? It sent chills down her spine. The threat was real and that monster has the ability to do it. She made her way to the Fire Lord's council chamber, her footsteps steady but purposeful. As the great doors opened and she stepped inside, every head in the room turned toward her. The heat of the central flame curtain cast long shadows across the polished floors. As always, her father sat behind the shimmering veil of fire, his posture regal and unreadable. Below him sat his closest ministers. This was not a war meeting, no generals or admirals were present. Ozai's deep voice echoed through the hall. \"Why did you come here, Azula?\" She stepped forward and bowed low. \"Father,\" she said respectfully, \"I bring a report… concerning Tai Lung.\" She recounted the events of the spar, how she challenged him, how he responded, and the fire he unleashed. She described it with as much clarity as she could manage, though even now the memory made her hands tremble. Silence followed. \"No firebender,\" Ozai said at last, his voice low, \"should be able to unleash that kind of power.\" One of the ministers nodded. \"The fire she describes… matches the records of firebending masters during Sozin's Comet,\" he said. \"But aside from that, no mention exists of flames that large or intense.\" Another minister added, \"The only thing that might come close to it… would be the Avatar. In the oldest stories. Is it possible… that Tai Lung found a way to empower his firebending to that level?\" Ozai turned his gaze to the man who had spoken, studying him with a calculating look. The minister immediately grew silent under the Fire Lord's piercing eyes. Then Ozai spoke again, slowly, thoughtfully. \"The Avatar has been missing for nearly a century. Despite our nation's efforts, he has not been found. What if… he died, more than once… and Tai Lung is his latest reincarnation?\" The chamber fell into stunned silence. None of them had considered the possibility before, but now that it had been spoken aloud, it took root in their minds. The ministers exchanged glances. Could it be? \"It is possible,\" one finally said, hesitantly. \"It would explain his unnatural power… and skill.\" Ozai nodded slowly. \"And it explains his strange stance during the Agni Kai two years ago. Perhaps no one taught him, it simply came to him… naturally. As the Avatar.\" Azula remained still, her eyes wide with realization. That would explain everything. His raw strength. His effortless mastery. His power that surpassed anything the Fire Nation had ever seen. How else could someone like Tai Lung even exist? She turned to her father, her voice low but urgent. \"If he is the Avatar… what should we do?\" Ozai's gaze hardened, and for a moment he didn't speak. His mind was clearly deep in thought, calculating the risks. Expose Tai Lung now and order his arrest? But what if they failed? What if the Avatar turned against them? On the other hand, what if they were wrong? One of the ministers broke the silence. \"I don't think anything should be done, not yet. Tai Lung has contributed greatly to the war effort. He's on our side. Why risk losing the Avatar? He could be our greatest asset.\" Another chimed in, \"He might not even know. It's not unheard of… some Avatars don't realize their nature until much later in life. And there have been mistakes before, false reincarnations, misidentified candidates…\" Ozai's frown deepened. The risk was immense. While Tai Lung was not the type to follow orders blindly, he was still from the fire nation and acted in the benefit of their nation but a misstep could turn him into a terrible enemy. And acting too late… could allow that same enemy to grow even more dangerous. The Fire Lord considered every angle, every consequence. Finally, his voice cut through the silence like steel. \"First, we confirm if he truly is the Avatar,\" Ozai said coldly. \"Then we decide what to do. For now, nothing of this is to be shared\" The flickering flames of the council chamber cast long shadows across the floor as silence lingered after Fire Lord Ozai's final words. Ministers remained still, their eyes on the throne. Then, quietly, Azula stepped forward once more, her voice calm and measured. \"It might be more beneficial to spread that,\" she said. Ozai's gaze turned to his daughter. He said nothing, but his expression beckoned her to continue. Azula offered a faint, knowing smile. \"We can spread rumors about my spar... and that Tai Lung is the new Avatar. Whether it's true or not is irrelevant. What matters is perception. The idea that the missing Avatar has returned, and is fighting for the Fire Nation, will raise the morale of our soldiers and terrify the other nations. They'll believe the Avatar has chosen to support us.\" A murmur spread through the ministers seated around the chamber. Some leaned closer, intrigued. Ozai remained silent, though his eyes had sharpened with interest. Azula paused for effect, then resumed. \"It will also restore the royal family's prestige. No one will say the Fire Lord lost to a child anymore. Instead, they'll say he lost to the strongest bender in the world, someone who holds the knowledge and instincts of countless lives. That's not a terrible defeat… it was a small misjudgement at most.\" Ozai's eyes narrowed, the flames behind his throne flaring slightly. \"And what if that makes Tai Lung decide he is the Avatar? What if he decides to bring 'balance' to the world?\" His tone darkened. \"He is the son of a highly respected admiral, one with many loyal supporters. This could turn into a civil war.\" Azula nodded, unshaken. \"We won't address the rumors publicly,\" she said. \"Let them spread on their own. Then, we'll bring in one of the Fire Sages to examine Tai Lung and declare that he is not the Avatar, regardless of the truth.\" She took another step forward, her voice growing more confident. \"At the same time, we quietly ask the admiral to keep his son's supposed Avatar status alive for the benefit of the nation. That way, Tai Lung will continue acting in ways befitting the Avatar, thinking he's not. And our enemies, and our people, will believe the Avatar is aiding the Fire Nation. We won't need to worry about them as the father and son follow a strict code of honor and morals\" A few of the ministers exchanged impressed glances. One finally spoke, his voice respectful. \"The princess is wise beyond her years.\" Another nodded in agreement. \"To turn this into propaganda… brilliant.\" Azula allowed herself a satisfied smile. Ozai leaned back on his throne, folding his hands. He regarded his daughter for a long moment, then finally spoke. \"Very well,\" he said. \"We shall follow the princess's plan.\" ___________ The next day, the capital of the Fire Nation buzzed with excitement. From the bustling markets to the quiet tea shops, from the soldier barracks to the noble estates, a single rumor took hold of every conversation: \"Tai Lung… the son of Admiral Lung… is the new Avatar.\" Eyewitnesses to the spar between him and Princess Azula shared their accounts in vivid detail, each telling more dramatic than the last. Some claimed the flames he summoned resembled a river of blue fire, others swore the ground melted from his power. The story spread like wildfire, igniting both awe and fear. And before long, it reached the Lung estate.\n\nAzula sat in silence within the confines of her chambers, her gaze just staring at the space in front of her, her mind was far from the present. Her body no longer trembled, but inside, she was still shaking.

            "content": "Tai Lung sat in front of his parents in the quiet study of the Lung estate. The low hum of voices outside hinted at the storm of rumors sweeping through the capital. Tai Lung had an annoyed look on his face, his brows knitted. \"Who came up with this rumor? I can only bend fire. One element no matter how powerful doesn't make me the Avatar\" Admiral Lung met his son's gaze. \"After the strength you showed in that spar and the skill against the Fire Lord back then, it actually makes more sense than you just being a very talented young bender.\" Beside him, Tai Lung's mother reached over and placed a gentle hand on her son's knee. \"Maybe you really are the Avatar,\" she said softly. \"And you just don't know it. It's happened before.\" Tai Lung sighed and rubbed his temples, there was no way he was the Avatar, he didn't belong to this world to begin with, but his mother didn't know that. After a moment of silence, he spoke up clearly annoyed. \"What now? How do we clarify this stupid rumor?\" Admiral Lung didn't answer immediately. He leaned back in his chair, folding his arms as he looked thoughtfully at his son. \"We don't.\" Tai Lung blinked, surprised. \"What? Why not?\" His father's voice was firm, pragmatic. \"The Avatar is the greatest threat to the Fire Nation, the one we've been hunting for almost a century. Even the mention of his return shakes our soldiers and emboldens our enemies. But now… now they think he's fighting for us.\" The admiral's eyes narrowed, his words deliberate and full of heavy meaning. \"For the future of our nation, you should play the role. I believe many of the ministers and high-ranking military officials will support me on this.\" Tai Lung's mother scowled, her expression darkening. \"You can't just push our son to be used like that.\" Admiral Lung turned to her calmly. \"It won't bring him harm. Just more prestige. He'll be seen as a symbol, respected, feared. Admired.\" He returned his gaze to Tai Lung. \"I won't force you if you don't want to,\" he added, his voice softening slightly. \"But this could bring great benefits to our army.\" The room fell into silence. Tai Lung stared at the floor, weighing the words, his jaw tight. He didn't like it, it felt like a mockery of his past life, it was a repeat but this time he knows he is not the chosen one, at least back then he had the chance to be the Dragon Warrior or dream to be the one at least. Now he is just a mirage, he will just be a fake Avatar, knowing very well this is not his destiny. Still he understood the logic behind his father's words. After a long pause, he exhaled sharply. \"Fine,\" he said. \"But I won't be fighting in the war or conquering lands. I'll continue traveling like I always have.\" The admiral smiled, nodding with satisfaction. \"That's actually what I want you to do, travel around, help fan the rumors. The more people see you, the better.\" Tai Lung's mother's eyes widened in disbelief. \"You're sending our son out again?\" The admiral gave a quiet nod. \"He will continue traveling wherever he wants and trying to find his path and goal in life. At the same time, he'll help our nation, indirectly. As a symbol, not just a soldier.\" She looked at her son, concern in her eyes. But then she sighed and gave a reluctant nod. —————— The same day, Tai Lung found himself face-to-face with Ty Lee. She had already heard the rumors that now spread through every corner of the capital. The moment she saw him, her usual cheerful expression was laced with worry. \"Is it true?\" she asked in a rush. \"That you're the Avatar?\" Tai shook his head firmly. \"No. It's just a rumor. I'm not the Avatar.\" Relief flickered across her face, but her brow remained furrowed. Tai continued, explaining the situation and his father's plan to let the rumors run unchecked and use them to bolster the army's morale. He added, almost reluctantly, \"I'll be leaving tomorrow morning. Early.\" \"Do you really need to leave so quickly?\" Ty Lee asked, her voice softer this time, almost pleading. \"My father believes it's the right thing to do,\" Tai replied. His tone was even, accepting. \"And I'll go along with it.\" Ty Lee nodded weakly, clearly unhappy with his decision. She lowered her eyes until Tai leaned slightly forward, a rare gentleness in his voice. \"If you want, you can come with me. Think of it as a vacation.\" Her eyes widened at the offer. \"But… what about the war?\" Tai shrugged casually. \"My participation is minimal. And even then, I'm too strong anyway. No harm will come your way.\" That made her smile a little, the brightness returning to her face for a fleeting moment. \"I still need to graduate from the academy,\" she said, half-teasing but half-serious. \"But… I hope the offer will still stand. Next time you come back, I'll go with you.\" Tai nodded lightly, the corner of his mouth tugging upward. —————— The next morning, Tai Lung stood at the docks as the sunlight reflected across the water, his ship ready to sail. His parents and Ty Lee had come to see him off. Admiral Lung was the first to speak, his voice strong and steady. \"Tai, wherever you go, stay true to your teaching and your honor. And know that I am proud of you.\" His mother stepped forward next, her hands lingering on his arm. \"Stay safe. And don't forget to write to us.\" Lastly, Ty Lee threw her arms around him, hugging him tightly. \"Don't forget me,\" she whispered. Tai smiled at them all, warmth stirring inside him, and bid them goodbye before boarding his ship. As he stepped onto the deck, he felt a strange tug within him. It was foreign, this sensation of being seen off, of being cared for in such a manner. Though it was his second departure, it still has a strange sensation to it. And yet… it was nice, knowing there were people waiting for him to return. —————— After Tai Lung's departure, Admiral Lung wasted no time. He made his way to the palace, where the Fire Lord sat in council with his ministers and high-ranking officers. The air was heavy with expectation; the rumors of Tai Lung had already begun to dominate the city. Ozai's deep voice broke the silence. \"Admiral Lung,\" he said from behind the veil of flame. \"What do you think of these rumors?\" The admiral answered calmly. \"They are just that, empty rumors. But they are not a bad thing. Quite the opposite.\" He went on to echo Azula's earlier claim: that the whispers would raise the morale of their soldiers and strike fear into their enemies. \"We must maintain it,\" he concluded, \"and I have already sent Tai Lung to spread the rumors even further across the Earth Kingdom.\" The officers immediately nodded, voices murmuring in agreement as they began to see the benefits. But behind the curtain of fire, Ozai clenched his teeth. This was the conclusion he had wanted, yes, but not like this. Admiral Lung had stolen the initiative, shaping the narrative before Ozai himself could reclaim dignity in the eyes of his court. Still, he could not contradict the admiral now. In the end, Ozai gave a slow nod. \"It is a wise decision,\" he said at last, his voice cool and controlled. \"Spread the rumors further. Let the world believe it.\" And in his mind, Ozai's thoughts burned hotter than the flames before him. [ At least in the eyes of the public, I lost to the Avatar and there is no shame in that.] —————— Far out at sea, with the waves carrying their ship steadily forward, Tai Lung stood at the bow before his gathered crew. At the forefront was his vice-captain, Han, who crossed his arms with a faint smile. \"Captain,\" Han said, his voice carrying across the deck, \"everyone wants to know, are you the Avatar or not?\" Tai Lung's expression remained calm as he replied firmly. \"I am not the Avatar, I am just a powerful and skilled bender. But in front of the world, you will act as if I am the Avatar. My father believes this will boost morale and crush our enemies.\" A murmur spread through the crew, but no one spoke against it. Tai Lung let the silence linger for a moment before continuing. \"We will keep traveling as we did in the past. Nothing will change. Our duty now is to spread the rumors, and from time to time, aid the war effort when needed, mainly saving our soldiers if needed.\" Han nodded, his grin widening. \"So, Captain Avatar, any thoughts on where to go next?\" Tai Lung gave a small shrug, looking out at the endless horizon. \"Any new place will do. If anyone has a place in mind to explore, we'll head in that direction.\" Immediately, the crew began calling out suggestions, laughter and excitement filling the ship. To them, Tai Lung travel is an open vacation. Tai Lung listened quietly, his eyes fixed on the distance. Though he didn't like the rumors, one thing remained true, no matter the world's belief, his path was still his own and one day he would find his destiny.\n\nTai Lung sat in front of his parents in the quiet study of the Lung estate.

            "content": "Many readers wondered why Tai Lung would agree to something so out of character. And they are right, the Tai Lung from the moment he first reincarnated would never have done this. But the Tai Lung in the story is not the same person anymore. His mentality has been shifting slowly across the chapters. Where Tai Lung Started Tai Lung began as someone: - bitter from his failure - angry from the betrayal - weighed down by self-doubt after his defeats. When he became human, he carried all of this with him. Instead of confronting it, he buried it, numbing himself with training, clinging to a simple goal: become strong again and then the strongest. Subtle Changes Shown Throughout the Story - Alienation: He can't connect with people normally. He still sees humans as strange, and never truly feels part of their world. - Displacement : He doesn't see himself as someone from this world. He was a kung fu master first, not a bender, and definitely not a citizen of the Four Nations. - The irony of his purpose being fulfilled : He took down Ozai and Bumi, the strongest benders of their nations. He achieved his goal, but it felt empty, almost undeserved, because the chi he brought with him made it too easy. To him, it was cheating. - Loss of direction: With his goal gone, he has no path left. Nothing to move toward. - Self-doubt: Even back in chapter 1, he began questioning himself. He saw versions of himself in others, people who chose forgiveness where he chose anger. He realized that in this world, he is the lesser person. Circumstances didn't matter in his eyes. Tai Lung's Emotional State Now He is empty. He is depressed, not in the \"sad all day\" sense, but in the real psychological sense: - apathy - numbness - lack of motivation - not caring about consequences - not caring about expectations - not caring about himself So actions he once would have rejected immediately now feel pointless to resist. Reputation doesn't matter. Nothing does. He only resembles the original Tai Lung when his rage momentarily takes control, that instinctive part of him that never died. Why He Goes Along With His Father Now He sees his father as the father who didn't betray him. And since he has no direction anyway, he simply follows the flow of his father's words. He is drifting in this world aimlessly, traveling around in hope of finding something that gives him purpose again. On the \"Fake Avatar\" Decision People called it stupid in-world, but the logic makes sense from the characters' perspective, not the readers'. -The Avatar has been missing for 98 years. Readers know he returns soon, characters don't. To them, He might appear next year, in another hundred or maybe never. - If the Avatar reappears the next day, the Fire Nation loses nothing. It's propaganda. A tool. Not a replacement for the real thing. - Why did Tai Lung tell his ship he would be the fake Avatar? Because he simply doesn't care. - \"The other nations won't believe it.\" . A man bending blue fire, hotter and larger than anything seen before, a rarity only ever associated with past Avatars (in terms of raw power) would absolutely spark fear and rumors. In their eyes, he becomes an evil Avatar who simply favors fire. TL;DR: Checkout symptoms of depression and try to compare it to the \"Out of Character\" behavior.\n\nMany readers wondered why Tai Lung would agree to something so out of character.

In their eyes, he becomes an evil Avatar who simply favors fire.\n\nTL;DR: Checkout symptoms of depression and try to compare it to the \"Out of Character\" behavior.\n\nTL;DR: Checkout symptoms of depression and try to compare it to the \"Out of Character\" behavior.\n\nTL;DR: Checkout symptoms of depression and try to compare it to the \"Out of Character\" behavior.\n\ncomment 50 comment Vote\n\ncomment 50 comment\n\nVote",

            "content": "In the north, in a small Earth Kingdom town called Ershi, Tai Lung walked alone beneath the burning sun. He had traded his familiar garb for the plain green of the countryside and wore a conical hat pulled low over his brow so that no one would take special notice. The town still belonged to the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation's reach had not quite stretched this far yet and that fact gave the place a brittle sort of quiet difference from the towns Tai Lung visited in the past. Tai Lung had wanted to see an Earth Kingdom town untouched, at least directly, by the flames of war. He wished to watch ordinary people move through ordinary days and see how a place not yet controlled by the Fire Nation looked like. As he walked the main street, he noted at once how badly the town had been battered. Houses leaned as if tired and the faces he passed carried the small, resigned lines of hardship. From a single glance, a visitor could tell these people were having a hard time. He wandered until he came upon the only restaurant in Ersh, a squat building with a sagging sign and a door that protested when opened with a loud creak. Tai Lung paused, weighing the decision, then stepped inside. The room smelled faintly of smoke and boiled cabbage. Behind that counter sat an elderly man, his hands folded. A young boy, perhaps two or three years younger than Tai Lung, was wiping tables. \"Welcome,\" the old man said, smiling when Tai Lung approached. \"You must be a traveler. It's rare for people to pass through here.\" Tai Lung inclined his head. \"I am travelling the Earth Kingdom,\" he said simply. \"I wish to see the different towns and sites.\" \"Our town doesn't have much to offer,\" The old man said. \"But I hope you enjoy your stay nonetheless.\" \"Thanks, can I get the menu?\" Tai Lung said. The old man's smile dimmed. \"We have no menu,\" the man said. \"It has been rough around here. We serve rice and cabbage soup only.\" \"That's fine,\" Tai Lung said. \"Give me a bowl of each.\" He reached for his coins. \"How much?\" \"Six copper coins,\" the old man answered. Tai Lung paid, sat at a corner table, and waited. Not long after, the young man who was cleaning earlier came carrying two steaming bowls. \"Thank you\" Tai Lung said quietly before starting to eat. The boy turned to leave but paused mid–retreat, then returned, closer this time. \"My name is Tao,\" the boy said, voice low but earnest. \"I heard from my grandpa you are a traveler. Would you mind sharing news? How is the war going?\" Tai Lung looked at him for a moment, the boy's eyes were bright with something like a promise and a stubborn grievance. \"Is there no news here?\" Tai Lung asked. Tao shook his head. \"Not much reaches us.\" \"Not much to share, then,\" Tai Lung said. \"Skirmishes and battles are happening all over the Earth Kingdom. The Fire Nation pushes forward, taking land bit by bit.\" At the name of the enemy, Tao's eyes flared with the unmistakable heat of anger. \"One day I'll join the Earth Kingdom Army and help drive the Fire Nation out,\" he said, the words almost falling from his lips like a vow. Tai Lung noted the anger behind them but did not speak. The old man, who had been listening with a tired look, rose from his stool and waved a hand as if to sweep the boy's words away. \"Tao, enough of that talk!\" he scolded gently. \"I told you I won't allow you to join the war. It is not your role to fight or drive the Fire Nation away.\" Tao's face hardened. \"And who is supposed to do that?\" he retorted. \"We must fight. I must avenge my father!\" \"One day the Avatar will return,\" the old man said. \"He will come back and save the world.\" Tao's reply was a blow, sudden and bitter. \"You've been saying that for decades! He didn't return! You've heard the rumours, the Avatar joined the Fire Nation!\" \"No,\" the old man argued, the despair in his voice trying to brace itself with hope. \"Those are false rumours. The Avatar would never do that. I know, I know he will come back one day and save the world.\" \"He won't,\" Tao said, and the words dropped like stones. \"You're waiting for nothing, all of you are, it's the reason we are like this. It's why my father died.\" \"You mean not resisting the Fire Nation?\" Tai Lung asked suddenly. Tao turned toward him, his fists clenched, his jaw trembling with barely restrained fury. \"For a hundred years we've been waiting for the Avatar,\" he said bitterly. \"The Fire Nation has been taking our land piece by piece, killing our families and still, the Earth Kingdom waits. If the nations had united, they would have crushed the Fire Nation long ago. Instead, they chose to fall one by one.\" The old man's hand trembled. \"It is the Avatar's duty to bring balance and peace to the world,\" he said solemnly. \"We are waiting for him to fulfill that duty.\" Tao's eyes flashed. \"My father was conscripted into the army to fight the Fire Nation,\" he said, his voice rising. \"He died far away because people like you decided to wait quietly for the return of a myth!\" The old man looked as though he had been struck, his shoulders sagging under the weight of the boy's accusation. Before he could answer, Tai Lung spoke. \"He is not wrong,\" Tai Lung said. \"If the Earth Kingdom had truly united, the Fire Nation would never have expanded this far. And if the Water Tribes had stood with them, they could have pushed the Fire Nation back to their islands. Even on the day of the comet, if the two nations had aided the Air Nomads, they might have survived the extermination.\" The old man's eyes grew troubled at his words. Tao, however, looked at Tai Lung with renewed fire. \"So you agree we should fight? That we should defend our homes?\" he asked eagerly. \"I will join the war, and one day, I'll avenge my father. I'll kill the monster with the blue flames.\" Tai Lung froze. Slowly, he asked, \"If you don't mind me asking… how did your father die?\" Tao's expression darkened. \"My father died defending Omashu,\" he said, his voice shaking with rage. \"The messenger told us our army fought bravely, until a monster with blue flames appeared from behind, killing everyone in front of him. The Fire Nation is nothing but a horde of monsters and murderers.\" Tai Lung let out a quiet sigh, and for a moment, his eyes seemed to dim with something like regret. \"There was no battle,\" he said softly. \"The army of Omashu, under King Bumi, laid a trap for the Fire Nation. They slaughtered five thousand soldiers, then tried to drown five thousand more. The blue-flamed monster you speak of led the rescue. Yes, he killed, but only those who stood between him and the trapped men. He did not kill more than necessary. The Fire Nation does not encourage killing without reason, but…\" He paused, his voice dropping lower. \"Some will, and this is war. None is innocent in it regardless of the reason behind their actions.\" Tao stared at him, his face paling. \"What are you saying? Are you a Fire Nation spy?\" \"No,\" Tai Lung said simply. \"I am not a spy. But that is what happened that day. I know nothing I say will ease your pain, and I cannot undo what has been done… but I am sorry for your father. Truly.\" He stood, his chair scraping softly against the floor. \"You are right not to trust the Avatar. But don't join the war. It will only bring you suffering.\" He reached into his robes and set a small pouch on the table. The sound of coins clinking echoed faintly through the quiet room. \"I know this money is worth nothing compared to your father's life,\" Tai Lung said, \"but it's all I can offer.\" Tao and the old man stared at him, too stunned to speak. The young man's anger faltered, replaced by confusion. Tai Lung turned toward the door and began to walk away. \"Wait!\" Tao's voice broke the stillness. \"Sir! Were you there that day? At the battle to defend Omashu?\" Tai Lung stopped at the threshold. For a long moment, he said nothing. Then he turned his head slightly, his face half-shadowed beneath the brim of his hat. \"Yes,\" he said quietly. \"I led the rescue of the Fire Nation soldiers. And I am the one who killed your father.\" Both Tao and the old man stood frozen, their eyes wide, their minds refusing to accept the words. Before either could move, the air around Tai Lung ignited in an instant, blue fire erupted around him, swirling like a living storm. The old man stumbled back, shielding Tao with an arm as the light filled the small room. Then, as suddenly as it had come, the fire vanished. Tai Lung was gone.\n\nIn the north, in a small Earth Kingdom town called Ershi, Tai Lung walked alone beneath the burning sun.

I know nothing I say will ease your pain, and I cannot undo what has been done… but I am sorry for your father.

            "content": "Two years passed in the blink of an eye. Tai Lung's life became a cycle of travel, training, and war. From dusty villages to fortified Earth Kingdom outposts, he left his mark wherever he went. Skirmishes flared across the land, and in each one, his might was displayed in full view of friend and foe alike. The rumors followed him, growing with every battle. To the Fire Nation, he was no longer just Admiral Lung's son, he was the Fire Avatar, a living weapon who struck fear into their enemies. Soldiers marched taller, prouder, when his name was spoken. But in the Earth Kingdom, his shadow grew darker, fear spread across the land. To them, the Avatar had returned as a monster, a traitor to balance, now waging war at the Fire Nation's side. Mothers hushed their children with his name; generals and resistance cursed their luck at hearing he was spotted nearby. Yet for Tai Lung, the war was just a minor effort in his life. Wherever he roamed, he took the time to write home. He responded to letters, letters carried the warmth of his mother's love, the weight of his father's pride, and Ty Lee's longing words, each one reminding him he had people waiting. Vice Captain Han never failed to remind him: \"Don't forget gifts for your fiance.\" And so, whether it was a finely carved trinket or a silk scarf dyed in Earth Kingdom hues, Tai Lung made sure to send gifts to Ty Lee. Today, he and his crew stopped at a Fire Nation-controlled southern base to resupply. The harbor was busy with cargo being hauled and soldiers moving about when another ship limped into port, a worn and damaged vessel that stood in stark contrast to the well-kept Fire Nation fleet. From it disembarked a boy with a scarred face and a weary gait: Prince Zuko. Behind him, as ever, walked the wise figure of General Iroh. Tai Lung had heard the stories. Banished for disrespecting the Fire Lord during a war council, the prince was sentenced to exile until he accomplished something \"worthy\" of returning. A punishment cruel enough that even soldiers thought of the Fire Lord went too far with it . As Tai Lung's sharp eyes lingered on the pair, Iroh glanced up and noticed him. The old general's brows lifted in recognition, and after whispering something to his nephew, he turned back to Tai Lung and raised a hand in warm greeting. Zuko, by contrast, froze only for a heartbeat before averting his gaze. He did not meet Tai Lung's eyes. Tai Lung decided he didn't care. He turned away and focused on his ship's resupply. But it wasn't long before a familiar voice carried behind him. \"Tai Lung!\" Tai Lung turned, finding Iroh approaching with his usual easy smile, though Zuko was nowhere in sight. \"Shouldn't you be at the prince's side?\" Tai Lung asked bluntly. Iroh's smile dimmed into a sigh. \"The prince… is having a difficult time. He feels lost in this world. Zuko is not a bad person, but he is ashamed to face you, after what happened years ago.\" Tai Lung gave a small nod. \"That's okay. I'll be leaving soon anyway.\" Iroh hesitated, his hands folding behind his back. \"Perhaps… you might meet him? Talk to him. Sometimes, a familiar voice can help more than you think.\" Tai Lung shook his head. \"We're not at the level where we can talk comfortably. What he needs is to get that 'achievement' his shitty father demands and return home, or learn that he didn't lose his honor, that he was not in the wrong to begin with. Nothing I say will change that.\" The old general's expression softened with regret. He leaned closer and lowered his voice. \"Zuko is too angry and bitter to accept Ozai for what he truly is. And that achievement, as they call it… is a cruel mask. His true mission is to find the Avatar. The real one.\" Tai Lung Lung froze, his sharp golden eyes narrowing. \"That's no mission. That's a sentence. You may as well have told him to never return.\" Iroh's shoulders sagged. \"My brother… he is too cruel. Zuko didn't deserve this.\" For a long moment, Tai Lung was silent. Then he let out a low growl of disdain. \"I knew that fire rooster was a piece of shit. But to think he'd go that far with his own son? He's lower than dirt. A piece of shit, through and through.\" Iroh couldn't help but chuckle quietly. \"My brother would not be pleased to hear you call him that.\" Tai Lung snorted. \"If he has an issue, we can always have a second Agni Kai.\" General Iroh laughed at that and said \"I highly doubt my brother would agree to that. So Tai Lung, I heard you refused the promotion to a commander.\" Tai Lung replied \"I prefer to remain a captain, a single ship and free to go wherever I want. On the other hand, being a commander is a pain\" Iroh shook his head hearing that getting promotion is the dream of every soldier, except for Tai Lung apparently. Tai Lung glanced at Zuko's ship and asked \"How come your ship was damaged like that? Did you encounter some water tribe raiders?\" Iroh didn't answer immediately, he looked at Tai Lung carefully then said \"Nothing major, just an accident in the south pole\" Tai Lung nodded then turned his back and started walking toward his ship. \"It was nice meeting you here, General Iroh. I wish you and Zuko luck. You'll need it.\" The general stood there, watching as the younger man walked away without a single backward glance. A sigh escaped him, heavy and sorrowful. He had hoped Tai Lung might still hold a spark of friendship for Zuko, something to ease the boy's suffering, especially after the unexpected events in the south pole. But it was clear to him now, Tai Lung had moved beyond such ties, leaving the prince to walk his exile alone. Iroh wondered what Tai Lung would do when he meets the real Avatar. —————— Days later, Tai Lung was training near the rocky shore, his strikes sharp and full of power as waves crashed behind him. The salty wind tugged at his clothes, but his focus was entirely on his training, until Han emerged from the nearby forest, his voice interrupting the steady rhythm of Tai Lung's movements. \"Captina. The truth is out.\" Tai Lung straightened, lowering his stance, a brow raised. \"What truth?\" Han crossed the sand toward him, his expression both serious and strangely amused. \"That you're fake. The real Avatar has been found.\" For a moment, Tai Lung simply blinked at him, then let out a low hum. \"Is that so? And how reliable is this news?\" \"It should be true,\" Han replied quickly. \"It's said Prince Zuko found the Avatar in the South Pole and failed to capture him. Here, look at this.\" From within his robes, Han produced a paper and handed it over. Tai Lung unfolded it and studied the crude but clear drawing: the face of a young bald boy, an arrow painted across his forehead in stark lines. Han pointed at it. \"This is the Avatar. He's a young airbender, traveling with a flying bison.\" Tai Lung hummed again, this time with more interest, his golden eyes narrowing. \"So that's why Zoku's ship was damaged, General Iroh must have tried to hide the truth… I guess he wanted me to help his nephew hunt the Avatar.\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed as he continued \"But this is strange, the Avatar disappeared for more than a hundred years, and now he's returned as a young airbender. Could it be that he completed a full cycle already? Or perhaps…\" His lips curled faintly. \"…perhaps this isn't the Avatar at all. Just another fake.\" Han shrugged. \"Who knows what's going on with him. But from eyewitnesses, he bent both air and water.\" That made Tai Lung's smile widen. \"All the better. I would like to meet this Avatar. He might prove to be a true challenge.\" Han chuckled under his breath, shaking his head. \"I expected nothing less from you.\" But then his voice faltered as his gaze snapped to the distance. His eyes widened. Tai Lung, noting the sudden change in his expression, turned. Over the horizon, above the glittering waves, a massive white shape floated against the sky. Enormous, furred, with wide horns and a flat, bearlike face. A flying bison. Tai Lung chuckled, his eyes glinting. \"Well, look at this. He's coming right toward us. This must be fate, don't you think, Han?\" Han shifted uneasily. \"Are you going to capture him?\" But Tai Lung did not answer immediately. His entire focus was locked on the creature, and on the boy who surely rode upon its back. After some time, Tai Lung chuckled and said \"Good thing we are not wearing the military uniform. We wouldn't want to scare the Avatar. Who would have thought wearing the nearby resort clothes will help us\" Han replied \"Captain, don't jump to conclusion, we don't know if the avatar will land or will continue on his path\" Tai Lung didn't reply this time, he waited for the bison to come closer.\n\nTwo years passed in the blink of an eye. Tai Lung's life became a cycle of travel, training, and war. From dusty villages to fortified Earth Kingdom outposts, he left his mark wherever he went. Skirmishes flared across the land, and in each one, his might was displayed in full view of friend and foe alike.\n\nTwo years passed in the blink of an eye.

            "content": "Avatar Aang, the last airbender. That was who he was, though sometimes he wished it weren't true. After a hundred years of being trapped in ice, he had woken to a world unrecognizable from the one he had known. The Fire Nation had declared war, not just against one land, but against all the nations. Balance was shattered, peace destroyed, and misery seemed to hang in the air like smoke. The guilt never left him. He knew the truth: his escape, his selfishness, his fear of responsibility, that was why the world had suffered alone for a hundred years. He carried that weight every day. But now he was on a journey to set things right, to master all four elements and restore the balance he had once abandoned. At his side were Katara and Sokka. They had chosen to come with him, to help him complete his destiny. Together they soared across the endless sea on Appa's broad back, heading toward the Earth Kingdom. After hours of flight, the endless blue finally gave way to a smudge of green on the horizon. \"Finally! Land!\" Sokka cheered, nearly falling off in his excitement. \"I missed the ground!\" Katara laughed softly. \"We only left the last island a few hours ago, Sokka.\" Aang smiled at their banter. \"There must be a village nearby. I remember lots of them being close to the Earth Kingdom shoreline.\" As Appa glided lower toward the coast, a cry rose up from below. Someone was calling. The three leaned over the saddle, peering down at two men dressed in unfamiliar grey clothing with red stripes. Sokka frowned. \"That doesn't look like Earth Kingdom clothes to me.\" Katara tilted her head. \"Maybe they need help?\" \"Let's find out.\" Aang leaned forward. \"Yip yip!\" Appa's great body tilted downward and descended, the wind rushing past as they landed near the strangers. The younger of the two men stepped forward calmly, his eyes fixed on them. \"I must admit,\" he said evenly, \"for a moment I thought you wouldn't come down.\" Aang offered his friendliest smile. \"Hello there! We heard you calling. Do you need help?\" The man shook his head. \"No, I don't. I am Tai Lung. And I just heard about the return of the Avatar and his flying bison. I wanted to meet the legendary Avatar in person.\" From behind him, Katara and Sokka peeked out, eyes narrowing with suspicion. Aang straightened a little. \"It's nice to meet you, Tai Lung. I'm Aang, and yes, I am the Avatar. These are my friends, Katara and Sokka, from the Southern Water Tribe.\" Tai Lung's voice was polite, almost warm. \"Nice to meet you. So, Avatar, is it true you can bend all four elements?\" Aang rubbed the back of his neck, his smile turning awkward. \"Well, not yet. I've mastered airbending, but I still need to learn the others.\" \"Hmm.\" Tai Lung's golden eyes narrowed in thought. \"So you still have much to learn. A little disappointing, I must admit. I had hoped you already mastered them all. And… how come you're still young? Did you complete a full cycle?\" Sokka scowled and cut in. \"Buddy, what's with all the questions? Is that how you talk to someone you just met?\" Tai Lung didn't seem fazed. \"I'm just curious. The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years, and he's the only thing the Fire Nation fears. It's only natural to ask, no?\" Aang shifted uneasily, but he forced a smile. \"I was trapped in ice. I was freed just recently.\" \"I see.\" Tai Lung nodded slowly. \"So it's safe to assume you can't bring balance just yet. You'll need time to grow, to become truly powerful, as the legends say. Well, Avatar, I sincerely hope you won't be taken down before you master the four elements.\" \"Uh… thanks,\" Aang said awkwardly. Katara stepped forward, her chin high. \"Aang will master the four elements. He will defeat the Fire Lord and bring balance back to the world.\" Tai Lung chuckled. \"Honestly, beating the Fire Rooster won't bring balance, it wasn't balanced even before him. But I suppose that's a first step.\" He lifted a hand and pointed toward the treeline. \"Don't go that way. There's a Fire Nation base nearby. You don't want to get trapped at the start of your journey.\" The three of them blinked in surprise at his warning, but they managed to thank him all the same. \"I look forward to meeting you again,\" Tai Lung said, turning to leave. \"When you've mastered the four elements.\" Aang climbed back into Appa's saddle, but paused. Something was gnawing at him. \"Wait… how did you know I was back? How did the news spread so fast?\" Tai Lung turned, smiling faintly. He raised his hand, and flames burst to life in his palm. The three froze, eyes wide. \"The Fire Nation already knows,\" Tai said smoothly. His smile widened as the fire burned in his hand. \"As I said, I look forward to meeting you in the future, Avatar\" And with that, he walked away, the silent man at his side following. Aang, Katara, and Sokka sat frozen in place. They couldn't believe they had just spoken so casually with a firebender the whole time. \"I knew their clothes were strange , but to think they are firebenders ! \" Sokka said in a shocked tone. \"But why would they speak with us like that? Why warn us of the Fire Nation base instead of tricking us into a trap?\" Katara asked, her tone confused. None of this made sense to her. Aang was silent for some time, then said with a smile, \"Just like there are bad people like the Fire Lord, the Fire Nation must have some good people. Not only did Tai Lung warn us, but did you hear what he called the Fire Lord? 'Fire Rooster'!\" Sokka blinked then said with a nod, \"Yeah, as strange as it is, a firebender calling the Fire Lord a 'fire rooster' must mean Tai Lung doesn't approve of the Fire Lord and the war. He wants you to master all four elements and bring balance to the world!\" —————— On the other side, Han walked behind Tai Lung silently. When they were far enough from the Avatar and his group, he spoke. \"Captain, not only did you not try to fight or capture the Avatar, but you even warned him of our base. That's treason.\" Tai Lung replied casually, \"You heard him. He has only mastered one element. Until he masters all four, he is not worthy to be called the Avatar. One day, if he becomes truly master of the four elements I shall challenge to a battle. As for now, I won't initiate attacks on him or anyone for that matter, if the Fire Rooster or anyone has an issue with my choices, they can challenge me to an Agni Kai.\" \"Four years and I still don't understand you\" Hans said. \"I am not proud of many things I have done and I still don't know why I was born in this world.... I would rather not inflict more harm on others\" Tai Lung replied. Han sighed and said, \"I won't report our encounter with the Avatar or any of your words.\" After a moment of silence between the two, Tai Lung said, \"You know, I am a little jealous of that bison. The Avatar and his group can travel so quickly and easily in the sky. It would be nice if I could fly as well.\" Tai Lung stopped in his tracks then said, \"We can propel ourselves with fire. If I use enough power and control, I should be able to fly, no? Now that's something worth trying. What do you think?\" Han shook his head and said, \"This is madness.\" —————— After their encounter with Tai Lung, the group decided to heed his advice and instead move along the southern shoreline, far enough to avoid the Fire Nation army and close enough to find any of the southern Earth Kingdom islands. As they traveled, they unknowingly came across Kyoshi Island. As the group landed on the island, they were quickly captured by the Kyoshi warriors and led into the village for interrogation, tied and blindfolded. \"You three have some explaining to do. Who are you and why did you come to our island?\" the chief of the island asked. \"And if you don't answer all of our questions, we are feeding you to the sea fish,\" a girl added. \"Show yourselves, cowards!\" Sokka spoke loudly. The girls stepped forward and removed the blindfolds from the trio. Sokka, looking around at the painted faces of the girls, asked, \"Where are the men who captured us?\" \"There are no men. Now answer our questions,\" the girl next to the chief answered. \"Yeah sure, as if we would believe a bunch of girls did that,\" Sokka replied sarcastically. \"A bunch of girls? It looks like the fish will eat well tonight,\" the girl replied threateningly. \"No, don't hurt him! My brother is just an idiot sometimes,\" Katara spoke up in fear for Sokka. \"It is all my fault. I wanted to ride the Elephant Koi fish,\" Aang answered. \"How do we know you are not from the Earth Kingdom and you are here to spy on us? Kyoshi has nothing to do with this war!\" the chief asked sternly. Aang's face brightened as he said, \"This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi.\" \"And how could you possibly know her? She was born here 400 years ago,\" the chief replied with disdain. \"I know her because I am the Avatar,\" Aang answered with a confident smile. There was a moment of silence, then the chief spoke: \"They are liars and imposters. Feed them to the fish.\" The Kyoshi warriors all took a stance. Katara spoke up: \"Aang, do something! Show them you are the Avatar!\" Aang quickly broke free from his restraints using airbending. He flew high in the air, then descended slowly, showing his mastery of airbending. Once he landed, he spoke up again: \"I am Aang, the last airbender and the Avatar.\" Aang looked at them, expecting them to believe him. Instead, he was captured again and tied tighter than before. \"You think you can trick us? Someone like you can't be compared to the Avatar,\" one of the Kyoshi warriors spoke with absolute certainty. \"But I am really the Avatar! I just showed you air bending\" Aang replied. \"Cease your lies, imposter. We have already met the Avatar,\" the leading girl replied, and the rest of the Kyoshi warriors nodded in agreement. Aang, Sokka, and Katara were flabbergasted by that. Aang was the Avatar!\n\nAvatar Aang, the last airbender. That was who he was, though sometimes he wished it weren't true. After a hundred years of being trapped in ice, he had woken to a world unrecognizable from the one he had known. The Fire Nation had declared war, not just against one land, but against all the nations.

            "content": "Katara said, \"The one you met is the imposter, Aang is the real Avatar.\" The chief replied, \"The Avatar we met was an honorable man with unheard power. It is clear to me that you are an imposter.\" Aang said quickly, \"I can prove it to you. I mastered airbending and can show you that I can bend water a little. I still need to learn to master the four elements.\" The chief frowned, clearly not believing him, then said, \"Bring a jar of water. If he can't bend it, he and his companions will be fed to the fish.\" One of the Kyoshi warriors left while the others remained focused on the trio. Shortly after, the girl returned with a jar of water and put it in front of Aang, while two more Kyoshi warriors freed Aang but were clearly on guard for any sudden movement. Aang moved to show them he could lift the water and move it in the air, which left the Kyoshi warriors and chief shocked. The chief spoke, \"How could this be? He can bend water and air! He is the real Avatar!\" The rest of the Kyoshi warriors stood there shocked as well. Sokka spoke with a conceited tone, \"We told you he is the Avatar, and it looks like you are easy to trick.\" All the girls stared at him dangerously, clearly not happy with his words. The chief said, \"Free them.\" The girls freed the group, but when it came to Sokka, they were clearly reluctant to let him go. The chief spoke again, \"This village is under Fire Nation control. Please leave, Avatar. We are not going to let the Fire Nation know of your arrival.\" The group were taken aback again, and Aang said, \"How could you be under Fire Nation control?\" The chief replied, \"The Fire Nation came years ago, led by the Fire Avatar. They defeated our warriors and declared this island their territory. They didn't kill or harm anyone, just a simple agreement to not hurt the Fire Nation people and interests in return for our cooperation. The Fire Avatar even helped us solve our famine problem without asking anything in return.\" Katara spoke, \"The Fire Avatar? Does the Fire Nation have a person walking around calling himself the Avatar? And why would he help you?\" The chief replied, \"It is not that simple. When the Fire Avatar came by, he didn't claim himself to be an Avatar or anything special, just a Fire Nation Captain. He carried himself with honor and pride, he made sure no harm was brought to us and as I said he solved the famine problem. Later on when we heard of the stories, we believed it. We believed he helped the island because he was the new Avatar\" The chief continued, \"What truly set him apart from the rest was his terrifying blue flame, a flame unlike anything we have seen or heard of. He wielded lightning that could defeat a giant sea monster. Even without bending, he is still unmatched. When he came here, he defeated all of our Kyoshi warriors without bending and unarmed.\" One of the girls added, \"He went easy on us. We saw him later destroy rocks with his bare hands.\" The chief nodded at that and said, \"When he came here, he was probably your age, Avatar. It was until later we heard the stories of the Fire Avatar, a bender so powerful that he is a one-man army. He could defeat earth armies on his own.\" Sokka said, \"There is no way the Fire Nation has a bender like that.\" The chief replied, \"They do, and he is the real deal, the most powerful bender in the entire Fire Nation and probably in history. It is why everyone believes he is the Avatar, the Avatar who uses fire only.\" The chief said calmly, \"Please leave this island. We don't want to be dragged into the war. And we owe the Fire Avatar a great debt for helping us\" The trio looked at each other with troubled and confused faces. —————— Aang and the rest of his group left Kyoshi Island immediately. They still couldn't believe what they had heard about the so-called Fire Avatar, a bender so powerful that everyone believed him to be the real Avatar. The fact that he acted with honor and had even saved a village made it feel even more unreal. Aang decided their next destination would be Omashu, where he used to visit his friend Bumi and play with the world's greatest slide, the mail system. The result, however, was Aang and his group causing damage and disturbance throughout the city, which eventually led them to be dragged before the King of Omashu. The king quickly figured out that Aang was the Avatar and decided to test him. He gave Aang three deadly challenges to save Katara and Sokka. After Aang succeeded, the King gave him one last challenge: to say his name. Aang, thinking hard, realized the truth. The King was none other than his old friend Bumi. Now the group stood in the throne room, speaking to Bumi. Bumi laughed and said that messing with people was pretty fun, but he still had a good reason. The world had changed too much in a hundred years, and it needed balance. His tone grew serious as he focused on Aang and said, \"You have a difficult task ahead of you. You must learn all four elements to defeat the Fire Lord and bring balance.\" Aang nodded at that, but Bumi's face turned grim. \"Defeating the Fire Lord won't be easy,\" he said. \"And he might not even be your greatest obstacle. Among the Fire Nation's ranks, there is a literal monster… a firebender unlike any other.\" Aang asked, \"Is it the imposter people are calling the Fire Avatar?\" Bumi nodded gravely. \"You have seen my hands and body. They're full of burn marks. I received them when I met that monster. I was lucky to survive him. If not for his sense of honor and pride, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you.\" Aang's eyes widened with fear. \"Is he really that strong? Stronger than the Fire Lord?\" Bumi nodded again. \"After my defeat, I began investigating him. I found out that he once had a duel with Fire Lord Ozai. The Fire Lord was losing… while that monster wasn't even bending. And once he did firebend, the Fire Lord was nearly killed.\" Aang paled at the thought. Bumi placed a firm hand on his shoulder. \"I don't want to scare you, Aang. You are the Avatar. Once you master all four elements, I know you can defeat that monster. But before then, you must avoid him at all costs. Before you are ready… if you hear the name Tai Lung, just run.\" Aang was stunned. His heart pounded as he asked, \"This Tai Lung… how does he look?\" Bumi thought for a moment and described him: his golden eyes, black hair tied into a ponytail, sharp young features, and that he was only sixteen years old. Aang swallowed hard, and so did Katara and Sokka. Bumi noticed the change in their expressions. He blinked, then asked slowly, \"You met him, didn't you?\" Aang nodded. —————— After Aang and his two friends left, Bumi sat alone in the throne room, his gaze drifting to his burned hand. The scars had long since healed, but the memory of how he got them never faded. He was surprised to hear that Aang had already met Tai Lung and even more surprised that Tai Lung hadn't tried to fight him. It wasn't clear why Tai Lung had chosen not to capture or test the boy. But in Bumi's mind, the answer was simple enough: Tai Lung most likely wanted to face the Avatar at his full strength, not a child who only knew how to bend air. In Bumi's eyes, that was the best possible outcome for now. Aang needed time to grow, to learn, and to become a proper Avatar. Whatever Tai Lung's reasons were, the result was the same, it had allowed Aang to walk away safely, and perhaps, for the foreseeable future, things would remain that way. Bumi's mind drifted back to the day he had first met Tai Lung. That day still burned vividly in his memory. In his long life, he had faced countless opponents, but Tai Lung was different. He was a monster unlike any bender Bumi had ever seen. In truth, when the rumors spread claiming Tai Lung was the Avatar, Bumi had believed them. Bumi sighed, leaning back on his throne. He was glad to see Aang again after so long, safe, alive, and still with the spark of his youth intact. And most of all, he was glad that the worst had not come to pass. The Fire Nation didn't have the Avatar on their side.\n\nKatara said, \"The one you met is the imposter, Aang is the real Avatar.\"\n\nKatara said, \"The one you met is the imposter, Aang is the real Avatar.\"\n\nKatara said, \"The one you met is the imposter, Aang is the real Avatar.\"\n\nThe chief replied, \"The Avatar we met was an honorable man with unheard power.

            "content": "Bumi POV They called me the mad king. And, truth be told, they weren't entirely wrong. Living more than a hundred years in this world without a touch of madness would be unbearably dull. But even madness has its shape, its form, its wisdom. What no one could deny, no matter how they mocked me, was that I had my own way of seeing the world, sharper even than theirs. And today, that sharpness was put to use. I was leading my army into the Zaofu Mountain Range, prepared to ambush the Fire Nation soldiers. I had placed scouts there long ago, expecting the Fire Nation might try their luck in those difficult peaks. The path was narrow, steep, and difficult for an army to march through. Which made it the perfect place for them to attempt it, thinking no one would guard such a treacherous route. How wrong they were. The instant my scouts spotted the red tide approaching, word was sent to me. Without hesitation, I marched with three thousand soldiers. Thanks to the terrain and our quiet preparations, always best to prepare \"just in case\", we reached the range before the Fire Nation, setting our trap with ample time. The Zaofu mountains had a valley cutting through them, a thin scar with two small rivers running through its belly. And at the center, there was a long pass so narrow that no more than ten men could walk side by side. That pass was the key to everything. I divided my forces in two. The first, smaller force would lie in wait atop the cliffs, watching the enemy funnel through the pass. At my signal, they would bring the mountains down; rocks, boulders, the earth itself to close the pass and crush the invaders beneath stone. The second, far larger force would encircle the valley. Their task: seal it with rock, and at the same time, block the two rivers. The water would swell, flooding the valley, trapping the enemy inside. When the Fire Nation realized the pass was sealed and their path blocked, it would be too late. I had no interest in a frontal clash. Battles of fire against earth burned too brightly and too fiercely for my liking. I want them to waste away, to weaken slowly. The water would rise, the walls would hold, and the valley would become their tomb. And it worked. Perfectly. The mountains collapsed on the first wave, burying them in a rain of rocks. Those who remained were trapped behind walls of earth, unable to advance, unable to flee. Their leader hesitated, and that hesitation was fatal. By the time they understood, the blocked rivers had formed a swelling lake, its waters pressing against the rock walls like a patient beast. When the Fire Nation finally realized the trap, it was already too late. For a moment, I felt remorse. A flicker of pity for the men running in panic below me, their fire useless against stone and rising water. But pity could not save my people. Mercy could not hold the Fire Nation back. So I stood upon my wall of earth, watching them scramble, knowing in days, they would all die there. And then, everything changed just when everything was about to end. A small force arrived days later, no more than five hundred Fire Nation soldiers sent to free their trapped comrades. Five hundred against my three thousand. Six to one. Odds even a \"mad\" king could count. They had no chance. Yet as they approached, something felt… strange. Their formation spread wide, as if they meant to cover every inch of ground, though their numbers were too few. And from among them, a single soldier rode forward, mounted on a mongoose lizard. Alone. Straight toward us. My soldiers hurled rocks at him, determined to crush this fool before he could reach the walls. But he leapt from his mount with uncanny grace, twisting through the air, dodging every boulder as though he saw their paths before they even flew. He landed lightly, and without a pause, kept walking forward with a calm, terrible confidence. I leaned forward, studying him. His face was young, far too young for such a display of skill. Why, I wondered, would a boy march alone toward three thousand men? My wondering was answered almost immediately. The boy suddenly moved, lightning crackled around his body, raw and violent, and in the next instant the greatest lightning bending I had ever seen was unleashed toward us, toward the earth wall. I widened my old eyes, throwing up rocks in a desperate attempt to intercept the strike. Too late. Too weak. The lightning shattered my defenses as though they were nothing, then slammed into the wall, tearing it apart in an explosion of blinding light and raw fire. The water we had dammed surged forward, bursting free with a crashing force that shook the valley. \"Hold the wall! Block it!\" I roared, my voice ragged. But even as I shouted, another lightning bolt split the air, striking a different section. A second section of the wall collapsed, stone and mud splintering under the furious strike. In moments, the entire barrier gave way. The torrent swept through with merciless strength, washing away my men, those who stood atop the wall, and those stationed behind it, all of them swallowed in an instant. I myself was thrown down, body crashing into the mud. My hands pressed to the earth instinctively, trying to steady, to resist. The tide weakened as it poured out of the valley, leaving only thick, sucking mud where moments ago there had been soldiers and stone. I lifted my head and looked forward. The boy stood there calmly, watching us. Then he smiled. Predatory. Cold. In that smile, I felt a dread, sharp and deep in my chest. This boy was not normal. No, he was something else entirely. A wild beast hiding in human skin. For a breath, I was frozen in that realization. But already my men were recovering, dragging themselves from the mud. Dozens encircled him, weapons drawn, bending stance ready. Beyond them, the five hundred Fire Nation soldiers pressed closer, step by steady step. And behind us, the trapped army began to stir, voices rising with the possibility of freedom. My time to act was vanishing. We had to defeat the five hundred quickly and retreat. It was the only option left. \"Attack! Cut a path! Retreat!\" I bellowed, forcing strength into my words. My soldiers obeyed, moving in waves toward the enemy. And then the boy struck again. He thrust his fist forward, and from it erupted a torrent of fire, the greatest wave of flame I had ever seen. It wasn't the usual orange fire. It was blue, dreadful and merciless. In the blink of an eye, tens of my men were burned to ash, their screams gone as swiftly as they came. I watched in horror as he lunged into the largest cluster of soldiers, his movements fluid, lethal. Each strike crushed bones, each wave of flame turned armor and flesh alike to ashes. His fighting style, if it could even be called style, was cold graceful dance, efficient, terrifying, as if designed just to destroy and kill. His fire burned stronger than anything I had ever witnessed, stronger than even the firebenders during Sozin's Comet, a century ago. Back then, the firebenders had been terrifying, yes. But none, not one, had wielded power like this. I shook the thoughts from my mind. Dwelling on fear would doom us all. No one among my soldiers could stand against this boy, no, this monster. If he was to be stopped, I would have to do it myself. And so I charged forward. The boy noticed me immediately. His golden eyes locked onto mine, and he gave me a predatory smile. Then he charged. I reacted quickly, wrenching a massive boulder from the earth and hurling it into his path. Any normal soldier would have dodged. But not him. He kept moving, straight into it, and the next moment his leg lashed out. The boulder shattered under his kick as if he were an earthbender. I was taken aback, but I did not falter. With a sweep of my arms, I bent a wave of mud to engulf him. The boy answered with a kick. A horizontal strike that birthed a torrent of blue fire, a wave like the ocean itself, rushing forward to devour everything in its path. My mud was nothing against it, it just vanished, swallowed whole by that unnatural flame. I slammed the ground, raising the thickest wall of earth I could muster. Even then, the heat seared through, so fierce it burned my skin from behind my wall. I knew at that moment, if that fire had touched me directly, I'd already be dead. Then I heard his voice, from above. \"You are King Bumi? The greatest earthbender in the world?\" I looked up. He crouched atop the wall I had raised, smiling down at me like a beast sizing up its prey. I forced the best smile I could manage. \"Young men these days are rude. First you try to roast an old man alive, then you start a conversation without even introducing yourself.\" The boy chuckled. \"Where are my manners? I am Captain Tai Lung of the Fire Nation. I've heard a lot about the mighty earth king and possibly the strongest bender in the world.\" I blinked. Then I gave him a crooked grin. \"I'm just a mad old man. You wouldn't want to be known as the Old Man Burner, would you?\" He tilted his head, eyes glinting. \"You know, I hate old men. For some reason, my luck's always bad with them. They've caused me both pain and humiliation in my life. So in a way, hearing you're the strongest and oldest… well, the thought of beating you feels strangely satisfying.\" I blinked again and said simply, \"That's too bad. I don't want to be beaten.\" With a punch upward, I sent the wall and the boy with it. Then I flipped the wall and smashed it down, raising a boulder with my free hand. My plan was simple: crush him between earth and rock. But he erupted in blue fire, a torrent that annihilated both of my creations. Another wave of flame came surging toward me. I dove into the ground, tunneling beneath and reemerging some distance away, chest heaving. The boy looked at me with that same challenging smile, then sprinted toward me again. I bent quickly, pulling mud to halt his advance, then moved to bury him beneath the shifting earth. For a heartbeat, I thought I'd caught him by surprise. His eyes widened, then the smile returned. He raised both hands high, then slammed them into the ground. The world exploded. Fire erupted from beneath, tearing apart stone, soil, everything in sight. Flames licked through the very earth as though it were kindling. The blast propelled him upward, and I watched, stunned, as he rose high into the air. Lightning began to crackle around him, dancing across his form as he looked down at me. Then he struck. The lightning bolt ripped through the sky, aimed straight at me. I twisted aside at the last instant, barely dodging it. My heart pounded in disbelief. Unleashing lightning while airborne. I had never seen or heard of such a thing. Behind me, some of my soldiers rushed forward, desperate to aid me. I screamed at them to stay back, but they didn't listen. The boy's eyes shifted toward them. Flames erupted, wide and merciless. I leapt forward, raising walls to shield them, to intercept. But my defenses couldn't stop that horrible inferno. I heard their screams behind me. Felt the flames crash against me, searing my body. I collapsed to the ground in pain, my vision blurred. Through the haze I saw him, walking toward me. No longer smiling, he frowned as though disappointed. \"You couldn't dodge or defend yourself properly. If not for your men, my fire would not have touched you.\" I forced words past my dry throat. \"You look annoyed. Did you want to beat me fairly? Well, this is war. You won't find fairness here.\" To my shock, he turned his back on me. \"A victory like this feels unearned. I will let you and some of your men leave. When you recover, I will come for a proper match.\" I hadn't expected this kind mercy, and never in my wildest imagination I thought this beast in human skin had an honor to uphold. A weak chuckle escaped me. \"Nah, you will win. I know I can't defeat you. But what if I offer a deal instead? Let us all go. Promise never to participate in attacking my city in person. In return, I'll order my men to help you search for Fire Nation soldiers buried under the rocks. There may still be survivors. And if not… at least their bodies can be recovered.\" He stood there, silent for a time, his gaze unreadable. Then he turned back, his voice firm. \"Fine. I will tell my people to open a path. I expect some of your benders to return and help search for survivors… and corpses. If they don't, I will lead the charge into your city.\" I don't care what others think, but I am sure that Tai Lung is a beast in human skin. And with him around, the Fire Nation will win the war.\n\nBumi POV\n\nBumi POV\n\nBumi POV\n\nThey called me the mad king. And, truth be told, they weren't entirely wrong.

            "content": "Far from the Earth Kingdom, Tai Lung's ship finally arrived at the Eastern Air Temple. From the deck, Tai Lung stood still, his golden eyes fixed on the ancient building carved into the peaks of the towering mountains. The temple seemed to float in the sky itself, unreachable and untouchable. Beside him, Han and the rest of the crew stared upward with open curiosity. \"When the war first started,\" Han said, his voice carrying a note of respect, \"Fire Lord Sozin targeted the Air Nomad temples. Not only because of the avatar born next among them but also due to their location, the location made them nearly impossible to conquer. Without the comet's power, reaching and fighting them would've been hopeless.\" Tai tilted his head, still studying the temple. \"How long would it take you to climb this mountain and reach the temple?\" Han rubbed his chin, humming thoughtfully. \"An entire day. Maybe longer. The soldiers a century ago destroyed even the stairs leading to the top. There's no easy way anymore.\" He turned to Tai Lung with a wary look. \"Captain… are you sure about this? It's been abandoned for a hundred years. No one lives up there.\" Tai Lung nodded without hesitation. \"I've seen how Earth and Water benders fight, how they move. I want to understand the Air Nomads. Maybe I'll find something about their way of living and training.\" Han let out a long sigh. \"Then I'll speak for everyone here when I say, we don't want to climb that ghostly place. We'd rather wait on the ship.\" \"That's fine,\" Tai Lung said evenly. \"Depending on what I find, I might stay a few days.\" Han gave a small bow of his head. \"Then I wish you a safe trip… and fine finds.\" Tai Lung smiled. Flames burst from his hands and feet, propelling him upward like a blazing arrow. The crew leaned against the railing, watching their captain soar higher and higher toward the temple peak. One of them whistled low. \"Think we could ever learn to fly like that?\" Han scoffed. \"Don't be ridiculous. Our captain's not normal. Who else learns to fly just because he got jealous of the Avatar's flying pet?\" The crew broke into laughter. Indeed, their captain was one of a kind. —————— The climb hadn't taken Tai Lung long at all. Fire still faintly smoked from his limbs as he landed lightly on the courtyard stones of the Eastern Air Temple. He walked forward slowly, his golden eyes scanning the wide and silent halls. The mountain wind whistled through broken arches, carrying with it the faint scent of old ash. All around him lay scars of war, burned walls, shattered tiles, gouges in stone where fire had raged a century ago. Yet what he found strange was not the destruction, but the absence of corpses, neither monk nor soldier. It was as if the temple had bled, then cleaned. He explored for hours, moving from one hall to another. In a small chamber, he discovered scrolls, records of the Air Nomads' philosophy of peace and detachment. In another, he found stories written in flowing calligraphy about the cycles of the world and harmony of the elements. Eventually he stumbled upon what seemed to be a training ground. The faded rings marked into the floor hinted at movements and practices foreign to him. Tai Lung studied it all carefully. Finally, he climbed to the temple's highest peak, where a small courtyard opened to the endless sky. To his surprise, he was not alone. An old man sat cross-legged in the center, eyes closed, posture serene, as if untouched by time. As Tai Lung stepped closer, the man opened his eyes and smiled gently. \"Ah… a visitor. I did not expect one today.\" Tai Lung tilted his head. \"Nor did I expect to find someone living here. Are you… a survivor of the Air Nomads?\" The man shook his head, smile never fading. \"No, not an Air Nomad. But you could call me their spiritual brother. I am Guru Pathik.\" Tai Lung's brow furrowed. \"Then why stay here, alone? It must be a lonely existence.\" \"It is not so bad,\" Pathik replied. \"The skies are full of birds, and the mountains are full of life. Loneliness is only a burden if you resist it. The universe guided me here, so I wait. I wait to teach someone inner balance. But…\" He looked at Tai Lung more closely, eyes glimmering with quiet certainty. \"It is not you. Of that, I am sure.\" Tai Lung chuckled softly, though curiosity flickered in his eyes. \"And how do you teach inner balance? Isn't that something achieved only through meditation and peace within?\" Pathik nodded. \"Yes. But peace is not always simple to reach. Many do not see what holds them back. Sometimes only reflection, or another's guidance, can reveal it.\" For a moment, Tai Lung's mind drifted back to the Jade Palace. He remembered Shifu's teachings, and the whispered truth that the highest mastery of chi required inner peace. Yet no master had ever explained how one was to find it. It was always… left to the kung fu master to stumble into. Pathik's gaze sharpened, sensing the storm beneath Tai Lung's calm. \"I can feel it within you, rage. A storm unchecked. One day it may consume you, drive you to commit acts you can never take back. If you are willing, I can teach you to erase that rage.\" Tai Lung stiffened, genuinely caught off guard, his mind drifted to his past life and actions. After a long pause, he muttered, \"Thanks for the offer. But I am fine as I am.\" \"Denying imbalance is imbalance itself,\" Pathik replied gently. \"Peace begins with admitting your chains. Only then can you release them.\" The words gnawed at Tai Lung's pride. He stayed silent, his jaw tight, his mind circling old teachings, old failures, old fury. At last, he gave a curt nod. \"…Fine. How do we start finding inner peace?\" The guru's face lit up with a smile. From his side, he lifted a wooden bowl brimming with a yellowish liquid, with a sharp scent of onion. Tai Lung blinked at it. \"You don't expect me to drink that, do you?\" Pathik chuckled, took a long sip himself, and smacked his lips. \"Ah. Tasty.\" He extended the bowl once more. Reluctantly, Tai Lung accepted it. He raised the bowl to his mouth, took a gulp, then lowered it again. \"You must have a unique taste to enjoy something like this.\" Pathik laughed warmly, the sound echoing into the vast mountains around them. —————— Pathik led Tai Lung deep into the mountain, through a narrow passage that eventually opened into a vast cavern. The cave's ceiling had cracks that let faint streaks of light spill inside. Scattered across the rocky floor were several small ponds, their surfaces reflecting the faint glow. The silence here was heavy but comforting, broken only by the faint dripping of water. The guru sat cross-legged in front of one of the ponds and gestured for Tai Lung to join him. \"Tell me,\" Pathik began softly, \"what do you know about chakras?\" Tai Lung lowered himself onto the floor \"There are seven chakras within the body,\" he replied calmly. \"They connect the chi pathways, and by opening them you gain mastery of chi and even increase its flow.\" Pathik nodded. \"That is true. But when you open all seven, you achieve something greater, true inner peace and balance.\" \"I opened them long ago,\" Tai Lung said without hesitation. But Pathik shook his head, his eyes narrowing slightly as though peering into the ex-leopard's soul. \"No. I can feel your chakras. They are half-open. It is strange… I have never encountered someone like you. Usually, they are open or closed. But you… you stand in the middle. Your body is ready, but your spirit is not.\" For once, Tai Lung was silent, unsure how to respond. At last, he said simply, \"How do we start?\" \"We unlock them one by one,\" Pathik replied. \"First, we must free your spirit of its burdens and shackles. Sit. Breathe. Close your eyes.\" Tai Lung obeyed, closing his eyes as the guru's voice echoed through the chamber. \"The first chakra,\" Pathik said, \"is the Earth chakra. It lies at the base of the spine. It deals with survival and is blocked by fear. Tell me, Tai Lung… what do you truly fear? Search deep within yourself.\" \"I fear no one,\" Tai Lung answered immediately, his voice calm, almost dismissive. Pathik tilted his head. \"Then perhaps you fear not someone, but something. Something yet to come.\" The words stirred something within him. Images flickered in Tai Lung's mind, memories of Fire Lord Ozai, brought low, defeated and humiliated. Then, sharper still, the humiliation of his own defeats: at Po's hands, at Kai's, at the chameleon's. Each failure gnawed at him, each memory threatening to drag him down into bitterness. He didn't want to become like Ozai, a once-great power reduced to a pitiful shadow in front of the world. But then he remembered the years of training, the endless hours of discipline. He steadied himself. If defeat came, he would not be like Ozai. He would fall with honor, with courage, not in disgrace. When he opened his eyes again, they were steady. Pathik smiled warmly. \"Congratulations. You have opened your first chakra. That is the fastest I have ever seen.\" Tai Lung inclined his head lightly. \"What comes next?\" \"The second,\" Pathik said, \"is the Water chakra. It lies in the sacrum, and it deals with pleasure. But it is blocked by guilt. What do you blame yourself for?\" Tai Lung hesitated. His mind drifted back to the Jade Palace, to his master, to his adopted father. He remembered the disappointment etched in Shifu's face the day he failed to become the Dragon Warrior. Worse still, he remembered the pain in Shifu's eyes when Tai Lung finally turned on the village, consumed by pride. He remembered when he attacked and nearly killed his father after twenty years of imprisonment. If only he had accepted his shortcomings. If only he had humbled himself instead of demanding destiny. If only he didn't see his father turning back on him as a betrayal. Perhaps things could have been different. Perhaps Shifu's eyes would not have been filled with sorrow. For hours, the visions replayed themselves, his arrogance, his bitterness, his anger, his fall, the hurt he had caused. And yet, beneath it all, a single thought rose: if he ever returned to that world, if fate allowed him to stand before Shifu again, he would apologize. He would admit his foolishness. When Tai Lung finally opened his eyes, there was a serene calm in them, a softness that had not been there before. Pathik studied him and nodded. \"You have accepted your guilt. And more, you wish to make amends. Your second chakra is open.\"\n\nFar from the Earth Kingdom, Tai Lung's ship finally arrived at the Eastern Air Temple.

The universe guided me here, so I wait. I wait to teach someone inner balance. But…\" He looked at Tai Lung more closely, eyes glimmering with quiet certainty. \"It is not you. Of that, I am sure.\"\n\n\"It is not so bad,\" Pathik replied. \"The skies are full of birds, and the mountains are full of life. Loneliness is only a burden if you resist it.

He remembered Shifu's teachings, and the whispered truth that the highest mastery of chi required inner peace. Yet no master had ever explained how one was to find it. It was always… left to the kung fu master to stumble into.\n\nFor a moment, Tai Lung's mind drifted back to the Jade Palace.

Then, sharper still, the humiliation of his own defeats: at Po's hands, at Kai's, at the chameleon's. Each failure gnawed at him, each memory threatening to drag him down into bitterness.

            "content": "The meditation cave was still, the faint sound of dripping water echoing softly. Guru Pathik sat calmly before Tai Lung, his eyes steady and kind. \"We arrive now at the Fire chakra,\" Pathik began. \"It is located in the stomach. It deals with willpower and is blocked by shame. Tell me, Tai Lung, what are you ashamed of? For what reason are you disappointed in yourself?\" At once, a vision clouded Tai's mind. He saw himself once more in the Jade Palace, his heart burning with ambition. He had been so certain, so eager to claim the title of Dragon Warrior, to see the prideful look and happiness in Shifu's eyes. Yet the day it was denied him, everything shattered. His fists curled as he recalled the blind rage that followed, the innocent villagers beneath his fury. \"I was once denied something I was desperate to achieve,\" Tai said, his voice low, almost harsh. \"In my wrath, I attacked the innocent. I vented my rage on them, and destroyed their homes. Release through destruction was the only thing I knew, what I trained in my whole life. 'Attack the weaknesses and make the enemy suffer', that's the core of my style and I turned it on the innocents because I was just angry.\" Pathik nodded, though his expression was heavy with gravity. \"And that shame still sits within you. But listen, Tai Lung, balance is not found by burying fault. It is found by accepting it, and then striving to make amends, however difficult. Shame weakens will. Making peace with your past strengthens it.\" Tai Lung's jaw tightened, but then he exhaled. \"If I go back there one day… I will apologize to those I wronged unfairly.\" A gentle smile touched Pathik's lips. \"Good. You have opened your Fire chakra.\" He continued, his voice calm but resonant. \"The next chakra is Air. It rests in the heart, dealing with love and it is blocked by grief.\" Tai's eyes unfocused as memories swept through him. He saw the old world, the Jade Palace, the animals, the endless kung fu. Sixteen years had passed in this strange new land, yet still, he drifted back to what he had lost. \"I live in this world,\" Tai whispered, \"but I do not belong to it. Everything feels wrong to me. I am all alone.\" Pathik tilted his head gently. \"Do you not have a family? People whose company you enjoy? People you might even call friends?\" For the first time, Tai's expression softened into something faintly warm. He thought of his parents, of Ty Lee and Mai, of his loyal crew. The corners of his mouth curved into a small smile. \"So you have such people,\" Pathik said, nodding. \"Then you already have bonds. You belong to this world, Tai Lung. You are not alone.\" Tai inhaled deeply, and released the breath in a slow, steady stream. \"You are right. I shouldn't linger in those thoughts, I am different but not truly alone.\" \"Then let us move forward,\" Pathik said. \"The Sound chakra lies in the throat. It deals with truth and is blocked by lies.\" \"I have never truly considered myself a human. Nor even a bender,\" Tai replied immediately, his voice full of clarity. \"I am not like everyone else. I never have been. What I told others was never the truth of what I thought of myself.\" Pathik's brows lifted in surprise. \"Then tell me, what do you consider yourself?\" A faint smile touched Tai's lips. \"I am a kung fu master before anything else. That is who I am. Everything else comes afterward.\" Pathik hummed thoughtfully. \"A new term to my ears.\" \"It is foreign to this world, but you can say it is like the root of bending styles without elements\" Tai replied simply. The guru gazed at him for a long while before bowing his head. \"Congratulations, Tai Lung. You have opened another chakra.\" He wasted no time moving forward. \"Now we come to the Light chakra, located in the forehead. It deals with insight, and is blocked by illusion.\" At once, Tai Lung's mind was filled with an illusion so real it twisted his heart. He was back in the Jade Palace, kneeling before Grand Master Oogway. The ancient tortoise looked upon him with pride. \"Congratulations,\" Oogway said warmly, \"for becoming the Dragon Warrior.\" Shifu stood nearby, eyes glistening with joy. Oogway extended the Dragon Scroll, waiting for Tai Lung to claim it. For a moment, Tai Lung just stared before his paw reached out. He took the scroll and opened it, only to reflect his face in its blank golden inside. Tai Lung stood there staring at himself silently, he lost track of time as his mind kept replaying his first life. Then slowly, he returned the Dragon scroll to Oogway before turning to look at Shifu Calmly, he said, \"I know now, that was never my destiny. Perhaps in my blind pursuit I lost my true destiny. And that is fine. It took me too long to understand the meaning of the dragon scroll and how I lost to Po. I lost the moment I stopped believing in myself.\" Tai lung smiled as he took a few steps toward Shifu, bowed deeply, and whispered, \"Thank you for everything… and I am sorry for what I have done, Father. I promise you I will find my new destiny this time.\" Then, turning to Oogway, he added, \"I know this was your way of testing me. But I will never find peace if I simply let it go like this.\" Before hesitation could stop him, Tai Lung's fist lashed out. His strike thundered against Oogway, sending the master flying. The illusion shattered. Tai opened his eyes in the cave and laughed, a raw, unrestrained sound. \"That felt good, even if it was just an illusion.\" Pathik stared at him strangely. He had not seen the vision itself, but he could feel the ripple of Tai Lung's chi, the emotions radiating from him. Whatever had occurred had been steeped in violence, yet somehow, impossibly, the chakra had opened. When Pathik's senses returned, he found Tai Lung watching him silently, waiting. With a soft chuckle, the guru reached for the familiar bowl of onion-scented soup and extended it. Tai took it with a smirk, drinking deeply. \"You should come out of seclusion and taste real food for once.\" Pathik laughed quietly. Pathik continued \"The final chakra, the thought chakra, located at the crown of the head. It dealt with cosmic energy and was blocked by earthly attachment.\" Tai Lung paused at that and said, \"That's not possible.\" Pathik replied, \"You must let go of it all if you want to open the final chakra and achieve inner peace.\" Tai answered, \"Aside from the people who I know and I met in my life, my greatest attachment is my own kung fu, my training, and my skills. If I let go of that all, what is left of me?\" Pathik replied calmly, \"Everything has an end. You need to learn that losing something is not the end.\" Tai shook his head. \"Losing something is one thing, but letting go of it intentionally is another. The peace you speak of is emptiness.\" Pathik sighed. \"If you can't let go of it, you will never open the final chakra.\" Tai Lung chuckled, relaxed and without an ounce of worry. \"It is fine. I am satisfied with the other six. I want to remain true to myself and my teachings this time. Letting go is not even an option.\" Pathik sighed again and said, \"I didn't mention earlier that the process can't be stopped once it starts. If you don't complete it now, then you will never open the seventh chakra.\" Tai Lung paused at that. As far as he knew from the Jade Palace's teachings, inner peace took time and was achieved gradually, not in a single step. After a moment of contemplation, he said, \"I believe inner peace can be achieved in different ways. Maybe your method is not fully suitable for me.\" Pathik sighed. \"You have experienced the opening of six chakras. Your spirit needs to be ready and accepting. You can't just forcefully open the chakra later on because you tried something else.\" Tai was silent for a moment, then said, \"Now that I think of it, that is not necessarily true.\" Pathik looked confused. Tai smiled. \"Previously, I thought my chakras were opened, but now I can feel six of them truly are, while the seventh is half-opened, as you put it. Maybe I can force it open.\" Pathik replied, \"That's not how it should work.\" Tai smiled. \"I am a kung fu master. I don't fully conform to the laws of this world.\" He sat again, cross-legged. He began rotating chi in his body like he used to. This time, with his chakras opened, he could feel his control and flow were nothing like before. The last chakra was the clog of his body. Tai focused all of his chi and forced it into flowing through the seventh chakra. As he did, Tai felt a severe pain in his head due to his actions, but he persisted. He wanted the chakra to open forcefully. Pathik, seeing this, spoke up urgently. \"Stop this madness now! You will harm yourself!\" But Tai didn't listen. Instead, he pushed his chi even harder. The next moment, golden chi exploded from Tai's body like a torrent, shocking Pathik. The chi radiated from Tai's body like a storm, it was visible to the naked eye. Pathik just stared at the sight and whispered, \"How could this be? What are you?\"\n\nThe meditation cave was still, the faint sound of dripping water echoing softly.

He saw himself once more in the Jade Palace, his heart burning with ambition. He had been so certain, so eager to claim the title of Dragon Warrior, to see the prideful look and happiness in Shifu's eyes. Yet the day it was denied him, everything shattered. His fists curled as he recalled the blind rage that followed, the innocent villagers beneath his fury. \"I was once denied something I was desperate to achieve,\" Tai said, his voice low, almost harsh. \"In my wrath, I attacked the innocent. I vented my rage on them, and destroyed their homes. Release through destruction was the only thing I knew, what I trained in my whole life. 'Attack the weaknesses and make the enemy suffer', that's the core of my style and I turned it on the innocents because I was just angry.\"\n\nAt once, a vision clouded Tai's mind.

            "content": "After his unexpected gains, Tai Lung descended the temple toward his ship. The moment he arrived, his crew rushed to him, led by Han, who immediately asked, \"You've been up there for days, we were thinking of coming to check on you. And… what happened to you, to come back in such a state? Where are your clothes?\" Tai Lung had ascended the mountain wearing his military uniform, but now he returned shirtless, his pants torn from strain and wear. He replied calmly, \"I found something unexpected up there, but I didn't realize days had passed. Anyway, we are done here. Let's head back home, it has been a while since we left.\" Han nodded without more questions, it was obvious their captain didn't want to share details. As for the rest of the crew, they smiled hearing they were going back home. —————— Days later, Tai Lung's ship arrived at the Fire Nation capital. The moment the vessel docked, Tai Lung disembarked and headed straight home to see his parents. His return came as a surprise to them, as they had received no letter saying he was coming back. Tai Lung had to admit, he grew to enjoy his stay with his parents again, something he hadn't expected when he was first born in this world. But one thing surprised him,Ty Lee had left the capital to join a circus. In one of her letters, she had mentioned her desire to travel, but Tai Lung had never imagined she would choose such a life. At the same time, he learned that the ever-gloomy Mai had also left the capital, traveling with her family to a settlement in the Earth Kingdom. Her father had been assigned to govern the settlement and the surrounding villages. Tai Lung's life fell into a peaceful pattern of training and living in his home and it lasted for a whole two weeks till his father, Shulian, took him to his study to speak in private one night. \"I know you are still resting from your long travels and two weeks is barely enough\" Shulian began, \"but do you have plans for what you are going to do next? Are you planning to leave again\" Tai Lung replied, \"I am thinking of going to visit Ty Lee's circus. In her last letter, the circus is going around our settlements in the Earth Kingdom.\" Shulian nodded, then said, \"Recently, Commander Zhao has been promoted to Admiral. Right now, he is mobilizing the army, he is going to lead our forces to invade the Northern Water Tribe.\" Tai Lung had met Commander Zhao before during his travels. In his eyes, Zhao was incompetent and arrogant; sometimes he wondered how the man had ever been promoted to commander in the first place. To hear that he had now become an admiral was an even greater surprise. After some silence, Tai Lung said, \"Didn't we try to siege the North Pole multiple times in the past? Every time we failed when the moon rose in the sky. In the end, it was decided that the North couldn't be conquered. What changed this time?\" Shulian replied, \"Zhao has some secret plan, and he's confident it will work. The Fire Lord agreed based on that plan and gave him permission to assemble and lead the greatest fleet to invade the North Pole.\" Tai Lung's voice turned cold. \"Knowing Zhao's overinflated ego and incompetence, that won't end well.\" Shulian chuckled. \"I admit sometimes I think Ozai doesn't think at all. Since our days under Master Jeong Jeong, Zhao was not anywhere near the smartest or the most capable, just ambitious man with violent temperament\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed. \"You know… we can get rid of Ozai and put his older brother in his place. It is better for the sake of everyone.\" Shulian replied ruefully, \"Prince Iroh refused that. He said this is not his destiny. Personally, I believe it is the guilt and sadness of losing his son is what truly prevents him from becoming the Fire Lord. Iroh of old would not have left the fate of the Fire Nation in the hand of Ozai.\" Tai Lung asked, \"Do you want to take his place? To become the Fire Lord, I can make it reality and no one in the world can stop me.\" Shulian blinked, then laughed. \"No. I like my position as admiral. I wouldn't trade it for anything, even the Fire Lord.\" Then his face grew serious. \"Tai, I want you to join the invasion force and go to the North. Many of the men under Zhao had worked under me before, I know them in person and I want them to be safe, to come back to their children and families.\" He looked at his son with pride as he continued, \"I know you hate to fight in war or act as a conqueror, and I am not asking you to start doing that now. But if Zhao does something foolish and threatens the lives of our people, I want you to step in to help them. At the very least, help them retreat safely. Once you are done, you can go visit Ty Lee.\" Tai Lung sighed heavily. \"Fine. I will follow this ridiculous invasion.\" —————— Two days later, Tai Lung was on his ship heading north to join Admiral Zhao's fleet. As they approached the gathering ships, Tai Lung turned to his crew and said \"Remember, we are not here to join the war. Stay out of it and ignore any orders. Think of this farce as if you are on vacation but chose the wrong spot. And if someone has an issue with you, tell them to speak to me.\" One of the crew muttered, \"Why did we even come here, Captain? Couldn't you just mount some other ship to tag along with the fleet? What's the point if we are just going to watch?\" Tai Lung smirked. \"I want to go to the Earth Kingdom after we are done in the North to visit my fiancee. I naturally need you for transport.\" The entire crew began booing him for such selfishness. Tai Lung only laughed and ignored the accusing voices. It took them a few days to catch up with the fleet after leaving their home. Once they finally arrived, Tai Lung flew off his ship, heading directly toward the leading vessel, Admiral Zhao's ship. Many Fire Nation soldiers saw him flying over their decks, fire blazing from his hands and feet, and voices of shock rippled through the fleet. Even the soldiers on Zhao's ship froze in disbelief at the sight of a captain flying through the air with firebending and landing upon their deck. Tai Lung looked at the statue-still soldiers and asked calmly, \"Where is Admiral Zhao?\" The soldiers quickly led him to the main deck, where Admiral Zhao, General Iroh, and several other high officers were gathered. His arrival drew everyone's attention. Tai Lung was well known among the Fire Nation military. As the son of Admiral Lung, his name carried weight, and though he held immense power, he rarely participated in large-scale battles. Instead, he roamed, cleaning up only the problems he encountered. Admiral Zhao narrowed his eyes. \"Captain Lung… I did not expect your arrival. I was not told you were joining this mission.\" Tai Lung replied, \"I and my crew are not joining. We are just tagging along.\" Zhao frowned deeply. \"And why is that?\" \"I am not here to steal your achievement, if that is what you're worried about,\" Tai said evenly. \"I am simply here in case you mess up. If that happens, I'll help our soldiers retreat. Admiral, feel free to treat me as if I don't exist.\" Zhao's face twisted with rage at the implication. To think Tai Lung was nothing more than a backup plan for his failure. His voice rose angrily. \"Did playing the fake Avatar get to your head? Do you think you can do whatever you want?\" Tai Lung replied without care, \"It's not my fault that everyone is so weak that you can't tell the difference between a strong firebender and the Avatar. And yes, I can do what I want. Do you want me to prove it to you?\" Zhao's face reddened with fury, but he didn't dare refute him. Like many others, he feared crossing Tai Lung. Iroh coughed and stepped forward, raising a calming hand. \"Now, now, let's calm down, everyone. We are all on the same side. Captain Lung is here only for assurance and means no harm.\" Tai Lung's eyes turned toward Iroh. \"What is stranger than me being here is you, General. Don't you usually accompany Zuko around? Why did you leave his side? Or is he part of the fleet?\" Iroh sighed, while Zhao smirked and answered, \"Prince Zuko has passed away. There was… an unfortunate accident.\" Tai Lung didn't show much reaction to the news. He simply said, \"You have my condolences, General. I don't want to be rude, but Zuko has always been the unlucky one in the royal family.\" His words made Iroh sigh again. He didn't mind the blunt words and In truth, Iroh agreed with Tai Lung's statement. Zuko was indeed unlucky. He didn't deserve such a cruel fate.\n\nAfter his unexpected gains, Tai Lung descended the temple toward his ship. The moment he arrived, his crew rushed to him, led by Han, who immediately asked, \"You've been up there for days, we were thinking of coming to check on you. And… what happened to you, to come back in such a state? Where are your clothes?\"\n\nAfter his unexpected gains, Tai Lung descended the temple toward his ship.

He replied calmly, \"I found something unexpected up there, but I didn't realize days had passed. Anyway, we are done here. Let's head back home, it has been a while since we left.\"\n\nTai Lung had ascended the mountain wearing his military uniform, but now he returned shirtless, his pants torn from strain and wear.

            "content": "For the next three days, Tai Lung remained aboard Zhao's ship, silent and watchful. He listened to the discussions between Zhao and his officers, their plans, their boasts, their so called strategy. At times, Tai Lung would sit with General Iroh for a quiet tea session. The old general's calm and grounded presence was a sharp contrast to Zhao's bluster and boastful stand. This was the peace before the storm. The moment the fleet of Fire Nation ships reached the North Pole, Zhao wasted no time in barking orders. The massive armada plowed through the outer ice fields guarding the Northern Water Tribe's borders. Slowly, methodically, the ships encircled the enemy land, establishing a formidable naval blockade. Before them loomed the tribe's city, defended by a towering wall of ice and a relatively narrow path that led into the city. Zhao's eyes gleamed with ambition as he raised his arm and ordered the first wave of attack. A fleet of smaller, faster catapult ships surged forward. Their task was simple yet ruthless, they launched a ceaseless barrage of flaming projectiles. Harass the defenders. Test their defenses. Keep them occupied until the larger fleet could close in. Standing proudly at the prow of his ship, Zhao watched the assault unfold. His voice rang with smug confidence. \"This is a good first test. They are hard to stop and will force the water barbarians to show what they have. Decades later, the history will remember the great admiral zhao who ended the water civilisation and brought glory to the fire nation\" Beside him, Iroh folded his hands behind his back and spoke calmly, his words a quiet warning. \"Admiral Zhao, history is not always kind to people. Don't let your confidence blind you and you must not underestimate the enemy.\" \"You speak of experience, General Iroh. Fear not, I will not repeat your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se. I will make the world remember me for my victory only\" \"I hope you are right, admiral. For your own sake\" Iroh replied. The invasion had just begun and all was going according to Zhao's plans and expectations. The water tribe attacks on the ships was simply not enough to stop the invasion. Even the Avatar unexpected intervention was still not enough. The fleet continued advancing steadily. Through it all, Tai Lung continued to observe silently nearby, he had watched everything unfold silently without care. But deep down, he was thinking to himself [ So the Avatar is stronger than I gave him credit for. But more importantly, what is that enormous chi deep in the water tribe city? ] As daylight came to an end and the moon began to shine high in the sky, the Fire Nation fleet halted its assault. The battles ceased, each side preparing for the confrontation that awaited with the dawn. On Zhao's ship, Tai Lung sat silently nearby while General Iroh warned the admiral about the danger looming above. \"If we invade the city and do not finish the battle before nightfall,\" Iroh said gravely, \"the moon will be our downfall. Its power is theirs. It will make them undefeatable.\" Zhao smirked with absolute confidence. \"Do not concern yourself, general. I am working on a plan to handle that issue once and for all.\" Tai Lung narrowed his eyes at that. His instincts stirred, whatever Zhao was planning was no small matter. And yet, another part of him wondered if Zhao truly had a plan at all. The man had never struck him as a clever strategist. That night, Tai Lung walked the deck of the ship alone when his sharp ears suddenly picked up the faint murmur of voices, Iroh's and another quieter one. Tai Lung followed the sound to the edge of the deck and peered down. There, in the darkness, he saw Zuko descending slowly into the icy waters in a small boat. Tai Lung blinked, surprised. [So… he lives after all.] He shook his head after a moment, turning away. Without a word, he continued his walk to a quiet corner at the back of the ship, where he sat cross-legged, slipping into meditation. At dawn, the sun rose golden over the frozen horizon, and the Fire Nation fleet roared back to life. The armada surged forward, smashing against the walls of the Northern Water Tribe's capital. Soldiers poured into the city, spilling fire across ice. At the same time, Zhao gave orders to unleash massive drills, sending them burrowing beneath the city to burst from under the frozen ground. Tai Lung remained unmoving, still meditating. The sun climbed to its zenith before he finally opened his eyes just in time to see a figure leap onto the deck. The man wore a Fire Nation soldier's uniform, but with strange black spikes on his shoulders. He landed directly in front of Tai Lung. \"That's not even our uniform,\" Tai Lung remarked offhandedly. The intruder spun around, startled, only to find Tai Lung sitting calmly behind him. Panic flared in the man's eyes. He screamed, \"I am Han!! The future chief of the Water Tribe! Die fire scum\" and lunged forward with his spear. Tai Lung caught the weapon mid-thrust, yanked it free, and with a casual motion flung the man over the rail and into the icy waters below. He blinked twice, then muttered quietly, \"That was the future chief? The water tribe is doomed.\" After a pause, he exhaled while shaking his head then returned to his meditation. Time drifted on. The distant echoes of battle, the clash of weapons, the screams of men, all faded into the background. When Tai Lung opened his eyes again, night had fallen. The full moon loomed behind him, its silver glow illuminating the world below. Rising to his feet, he made his way to the strategy chamber only to find Zhao was gone. One of the soldiers stationed there saluted him. \"Captain Lung, the admiral took his guard and left on a mission to guarantee our victory.\" \"What mission?\" Tai asked. The soldier shook his head. \"It is a secret, sir. We were never told.\" \"Where is General Iroh?\" \"He disappeared shortly after the admiral left. We… we don't know where he went.\" Tai Lung nodded slowly, then walked back to the bow of the ship. His eyes narrowed as he gazed into the distance, where he could feel the enormous chi. After a long moment of contemplation, His curiosity took hold of him, he ignited fire from his limbs and took flight, streaking toward the chi source. As he neared the heart of the Water Tribe's city, the world around him suddenly shifted, bathed in crimson light. He stopped mid-flight and looked up. The moon, once silver, was now blood red. Confusion filled him. In both his lives, he had never seen anything like this. A foreboding feeling pressed against him, whispering of a bad omen. At the same time, the chi he had been sensing earlier rippled violently, growing uneasy. With a frown, Tai Lung pressed onward, flying straight toward it at full speed. And as he got close, his gaze caught the scene clearly: figures gathering at the heart of the city near a small pond. Closest to the water stood Admiral Zhao, clutching a small bag in his hand, with four guards at his side, tense and alert. Opposite them stood the Avatar, his pet, and his companions. Zuko, battered and bound, was strapped on the pet's back. And alone, standing to the side of both groups with a firm stance was General Iroh, his eyes fixed on Zhao as if ready for war. Tai Lung narrowed his eyes. Then, with a sudden drop, he dived from the sky. He landed between the two groups with a heavy thud as blue fire burst outward in a dissipating shockwave. The impact left everyone staring in stunned silence, their eyes wide in disbelief at the man descending from the night sky. Straightening himself, Tai Lung fixed Zhao with a piercing stare. He spoke \"What is going on here, Admiral? And is the red moon related to you?\" The chi he had been following radiated from the small bag Zhao clutched, pulsing with unnatural intensity. Not giving chance to Zhao to answer, Iroh spoke up \"Zhao wants to kill the mortal form of the Moon Spirit, effectively erasing the moon itself.\" Tai Lung glanced briefly at Iroh, then back to Zhao, his golden eyes narrowing further \"Was this your plan? To kill the moon?\" Zhao straightened with arrogance, his voice carrying a feverish pride \"The moon is our enemy. It empowers the Water Tribe. Since the spirit chose to dwell in this world at the cost of its immortality, it must face the consequences. And I, Admiral Zhao, shall be the Moon Slayer, the man who stripped the barbarians of their strength and conquered the North!\" Tai Lung shook his head slowly, his tone laced with disdain \"I knew you weren't the brightest, but this is a new low even for you. We benefit from the moon, it illuminates our nights, governs the tides, perhaps more things we don't even understand yet.\" Zhao's face twisted with rage \"That is nothing compared to removing the power of the Water Tribe! And you…\" his voice cracked with fury, \"you said you wouldn't stand in my way! That you wouldn't meddle in this war!\" Tai Lung's expression hardened \"Waging war, conquering lands, chasing your glory, that's your ambition. I won't stop you, I have no right to do so. But harming the world we live in?\" His eyes gleamed dangerously. \"That, Zhao, is unacceptable. Free the spirit or I will turn you to ashes.\" For a flicker of a moment, fear broke through Zhao's mask of arrogance. He clenched his jaw, closed his eyes, and with a huff, turned his back. He released the Moon Spirit from the bag. The world shifted instantly. Above them, the red glow vanished, replaced by the soft, silver radiance of the restored moon. Calm rippled across the pond as if the world itself exhaled in relief. Tai Lung gave a slow nod, then turned his head toward the Avatar's group \"You can have your fight or war,\" he said coolly. \"But do it somewhere else. The moon's place is off limits.\" A collective gasp came from the avatar group, their eyes wide as they saw Zhao hurling fire at the newly freed spirit. The next moment, the world went black. The moon vanished from the sky. Darkness consumed the night. Tai Lung's head snapped around, his eyes blazing with fury. At the same time, Iroh roared in anger, unleashing fire upon Zhao. The admiral's guards rushed forward to intercept him. Zhao, seizing the chaos, turned and bolted toward the exit without looking behind. Tai Lung's fingers curled into a fist. His eyes locked on Zhao's fleeing figure. With a growl, he punched forward. The pond erupted in an inferno of blue fire. The flames surged into a colossal wall, racing across the ice with the force of a hurricane. Zhao barely managed to turn, his scream echoing, then cut short as the blue blaze devoured him whole. When the fire finally receded, a giant gaping hole remained in the icy walls. Nothing of Zhao remained, no body, no ash, no trace. He had been obliterated in an instant. The silence that followed was suffocating. All eyes turned toward Tai Lung, horrified at the sheer power he displayed.\n\nFor the next three days, Tai Lung remained aboard Zhao's ship, silent and watchful. He listened to the discussions between Zhao and his officers, their plans, their boasts, their so called strategy. At times, Tai Lung would sit with General Iroh for a quiet tea session. The old general's calm and grounded presence was a sharp contrast to Zhao's bluster and boastful stand.

And alone, standing to the side of both groups with a firm stance was General Iroh, his eyes fixed on Zhao as if ready for war.\n\nClosest to the water stood Admiral Zhao, clutching a small bag in his hand, with four guards at his side, tense and alert.

            "content": "Tai Lung didn't even spare the Avatar a glance. His steps carried him closer to the pond where General Iroh now knelt, shoulders heavy with grief. \"How is the Moon Spirit?\" Tai Lung asked, his voice low. Iroh's reply was heavy with sorrow. \"Zhao has done it.\" With care, he pulled a limp white fish from the water, its life extinguished. Tai Lung's eyes narrowed, his voice edged with anger. \"If I had known this was his plan, I would've killed that bastard long ago.\" From his side, the Avatar darted forward, rushing past Tai Lung to kneel beside Iroh. Aang's face crumpled with devastation as he looked at the lifeless spirit. Behind Tai Lung, a soft, trembling voice of a girl with white hair broke the silence. \"It is over now. There is no hope.\" In that instant, Tai Lung felt it, an eruption of chi like a storm bursting free. His eyes snapped to the Avatar as Aang's tattoos and eyes ignited with light, his voice suddenly layered with the sound of countless others. \"No. It is not over!\" All watched in stunned awe as the Avatar stepped directly into the pond. The remaining fish, still swimming in circles, drifted toward him and began to glow with the same luminous light. Then, without hesitation, Aang plunged beneath the water. A burst of blue radiance surged outward, flooding the cavern. Before their eyes, the water rose and shaped itself into a colossal figure of shimmering liquid, a giant spirit of glowing water with Aang within its core. Slowly, the towering form turned and began to move toward the besieged city, leaving the pond and the stunned witnesses behind. While the others gaped in astonishment, Tai Lung muttered, \"I thought he was going to heal the moon for a moment. Instead, he decided to focus on the war. Balance is going to be a hard dream with an Avatar like that.\" Every gaze snapped toward him in outrage, even Iroh showed disapproval of his words. Tai Lung shook his head in disappointment, then dropped to one knee beside Iroh. \"Give me the spirit,\" he said firmly. Confused, Iroh hesitated, but something in Tai Lung's tone compelled him to obey. He handed over the dead fish. Tai Lung cradled it in both hands, closing his eyes as his body began to shimmer faintly. A warm golden light spread across his body, his breath deep and steady. Slowly, the glow seeped into the fish, enveloping it. With each passing moment, the radiance grew brighter, until the cavern was bathed in its brilliance. To the shock of everyone present, the world outside shifted. The night sky, once black and empty, now glowed again, not silver, but with a soft golden illumination, as if the heavens themselves had been touched by firelight. Tai Lung lowered his hands toward the pond and gently released the fish back into the water. The instant it slipped beneath the surface, the golden light dissolved into the world around them. And just as suddenly, balance returned, the sky overhead shone silver once more, the moon restored to its rightful place. The spirit fish swam peacefully, whole again. Iroh was the first to speak, voicing what every soul there was thinking. \"How…?\" Tai Lung replied \"Something I learned to do when I visited an air temple… Chi is the source of life for all creatures, even spirits. By giving the Moon Spirit my chi, it recovered. This only worked because the wound was fresh, and I had enough chi to share. But I'll admit…\" his lips twitched faintly, \"…I didn't know if it would work and I definitely didn't expect the fish would take almost half of my chi.\" He rose to his feet, but instantly shifted aside as a spear of ice pierced into the spot where his head had been a moment earlier. Tai Lung turned, his golden eyes falling on the water girl glaring at him with raw hatred. He remembered her, Katara. \"I just saved the spirit,\" Tai Lung said coldly. \"And the first thing you thought of was to pierce me?\" Katara's voice shook with rage. \"You killed my father!\" Tai Lung frowned. \"You've got the wrong person. I didn't even participate in this invasion.\" Her face twisted, and with a sharp cry she hurled another barrage of ice spears. Tai Lung raised a hand, and with a single lick of flames the projectiles evaporated into mist before they even touched him. \"You destroyed his ship and slaughtered everyone!\" Katara shouted. Tai Lung tilted his head, then asked flatly, \"Your father was part of the southern water raiders?\" At her silence, his tone turned sharper. \"Yes, I fought those. They struck first. I struck back.\" Beside Katara, the boy, Sokka, stepped forward, raising his boomerang with shaking hands, his voice tight with fury. \"We will avenge them.\" Tai Lung's eyes glimmered coldly as he faced the siblings. \"You two alone are not enough.\" Katara and Sokka narrowed their eyes at the same time, their grief transforming into defiance. With a sharp cry, Sokka hurled his boomerang, while Katara unleashed another surge of jagged ice. Tai Lung waved his hand casually, and a roaring wave of fire devoured both the boomerang and the ice midair, reducing them to smoke and steam. The blaze obscured the siblings' vision, but the next instant, Tai Lung burst through the wall of fire like a phantom. One hand gripped Katara's neck, the other clamped firmly around Sokka's neck. Both of his hands radiated an intense heat, not enough to burn their flesh, but enough to sear their skin and fill them with a painful, suffocating discomfort. \"I can turn you into ashes before you can even move a finger,\" Tai Lung said, his golden eyes piercing through them. Katara and Sokka's faces twisted between pain and terror as they struggled in his grasp. \"I am not against seeking revenge,\" Tai Lung continued, his voice steady and merciless. \"But at least have the power to do so. If you don't… then this is the outcome. A pointless death.\" \"Please.\" Iroh's voice rang from behind, deep and earnest. \"They are but grieving children who acted in a moment of anger. Don't hurt them. They don't deserve such a fate.\" Tai Lung studied Iroh for a moment, then exhaled a low hum and released the siblings. Katara and Sokka collapsed to the ground, clutching their throats and arms where the heat still lingered. \"I destroyed the water raiders' ships and burned some of them,\" Tai Lung said flatly. \"But most were imprisoned. As for the missing? They fell into the ocean, their fate unknown.\" He stepped past the siblings, his voice calm \"I don't know who your father is. I didn't catch the name of any of them. He could be free, he could be dead in the ocean, or he could be imprisoned. You can still search for him. And once you confirm his death…\" His golden eyes flicked toward them briefly. \"You're welcome to come after me.\" The siblings stared at him in shock, their grief clashing with the brutal honesty of his words. Tai Lung gave them no more attention. Turning toward Iroh, he said, \"General Iroh, take your nephew and head straight back to the fleet. With Zhao's death, the invasion has failed. We should be leaving. I will go ensure our people have a safe retreat.\" Iroh inclined his head slowly. \"What are you going to do?\" Tai Lung smiled faintly \"You saw the water monstrosity, the Avatar merged with the black fish. It will destroy our fleet if left unchecked. I'll put a stop to it.\" Iroh's eyes widened. \"That fish is the Ocean Spirit. You don't stand a chance against it.\" Tai Lung's smile only grew sharper. \"I like to challenge myself.\" Without another word, he launched into the air, his figure streaking with blue fire as he ascended before their eyes, heading straight toward the colossal glowing giant that stalked the city. From above, Tai Lung watched as the watery titan surged through the streets, drowning Fire Nation soldiers with every sweeping gesture. His gaze hardened. Rising higher into the air, he inhaled deeply, then roared, his voice amplified by chi. \"This is Captain Lung! The invasion is over! Zhao is dead! Retreat immediately!\" His command thundered across the city, echoing through every ship, every alley, every ear. Soldiers paused mid-battle, stunned. The next moment, Tai Lung thrust his first forward and unleashed a torrent of blue fire at the massive water giant. The blast struck, and the colossus faltered for a moment before its glowing eyes shifted toward the flying figure. Tai Lung smiled, hovering in the air like a blazing star. \"I can't have you drowning soldiers like that. I advise you to go back to the pond.\" The giant raised its arm, and with a sweep of its hand, an enormous pillar of water surged upward, roaring straight toward Tai Lung. Tai Lung snarled, thrusting his hand forward, and answered with an equally massive pillar of blue fire. The collision shook the city. Glowing water clashed against blue flame, their lights igniting the night sky. The frozen city below was bathed in a storm of blue and white radiance as the duel between spirit and master began.\n\nTai Lung didn't even spare the Avatar a glance.

            "content": "The clash of elements shook the night. As the wall of water and torrent of fire collided midair, a violent hiss echoed across the frozen city. Steam erupted outward in every direction, cloaking the battlefield in a blinding white veil. From within the mist, Tai Lung broke free, a stream of flame trailing behind him as he darted around the towering water giant. He hurled fireball after fireball, each the size of a house, crashing into the titan's liquid body. Every impact made the colossus shudder, rippling waves coursing through its form. The giant's head turned, its eyes glowing like moons locked onto Tai Lung. With a soundless command, the waters of the city rose in fury. Dozens of massive columns of water erupted from the canals and streets, all converging on the spot where Tai Lung flew. His golden eyes narrowed as he dove sharply downward, narrowly slipping between the crushing pillars that slammed together behind him. But the titan was relentless. The sea itself seemed to lunge after him, a wave larger than any building rushing through the city like a predator on the hunt. Tai Lung's eyes widened. It wasn't just an attack, it was as though the ocean itself sought to swallow him whole. He ducked low, weaving between icy paths and sliding rooftops, darting through the narrow streets. The wall of water followed relentlessly, smashing aside houses and bridges wherever he had just been. His jaw clenched. This… wasn't right. He had not expected the Avatar would continue the assault even at the cost of the city's people. Each crash of water tore apart homes, shattered frozen walkways, places that might still shelter frightened civilians. The destruction was merciless. Tai Lung's expression hardened. He had made a mistake by descending here, he did not want to be the one to destroy homes again, he won't repeat his first life mistakes or be part of something similar. With a burst of flame, he shot back into the sky, climbing higher and higher. Lightning began to dance across his arms and shoulders, crackling wildly like an angry storm. He let it build, rotating through his chi channels, before hurling it downward in a brutal strike toward the titan. The titan reacted instantly. Ice surged upward, forming a mountain between itself and the oncoming lightning attack. The lightning exploded against it with a deafening crack, the sound rippling through the city like thunder from the sky. Tai Lung's smirk faded into a troubled frown. The Avatar was already the most powerful bender alive, a vessel of countless lifetimes. The ocean spirit alone was a force of nature beyond comprehension. Together, empowered by the restored Moon Spirit, the sheer tide of chi radiating from the titan was unending, infinite. He could feel it, an endless pool of power. He would never match such raw might. Attrition was hopeless. His only advantage lay in his speed, his agility, his size against the immense size of the spirit. For now, he had no choice. He would hold the titan's attention, keeping it away from the retreating fleet, while his mind searched for some way, any way, to bring the titan down. Tai Lung darted around the giant once more, weaving between crashing waves and hurling wave upon wave of fire in retaliation. The spectacle was impossible to ignore. The waterbenders who moments before had been bending water and hurling ice at fleeing soldiers stopped, staring in awe at the battle between the fire bending master and the spirit titan. Even Fire Nation soldiers, retreating in fear and defeat, would pause to look back, their faces lit by bursts of blue fire against glowing water. Over the heart of the city, the air had become a battlefield unto itself. Fire rained from the sky, water exploded upward in geysers, and steam boiled between them. Mist wrapped the streets, blanketing the fleeing masses, rising into the sky like a shroud. Yet even through the veil, one sight could not be hidden, the piercing glow of Tai Lung's blue flames as he fought the ocean itself. For long minutes, Tai Lung had been circling the spirit's colossal form, fire and lightning spilling endlessly from his fists. His chest heaved, his golden eyes narrowing with both frustration and complete focus. Every strike seemed useless, the titan had infinite chi and water supply. He even began to curse the spirit in his mind [You stupid spirit, if you are so powerful and mighty, why did you allow that fool to kill your friend?] The thought pierced deeper than he expected, the more he thought about it. For a heartbeat, his fire stuttered, then his eyes flashed with realization. That was it. The Ocean Spirit, with all its boundless might, had not acted until it was too late. Why? Because it couldn't fight, not on its own. It needed the Avatar. It needed a vessel to channel its power. His gaze snapped toward the glowing figure at the monster's core, Aang, suspended like a puppet. Earlier, he thought separating the boy from the titan was pointless as it will build itself again. But maybe it was not the case, the titan might collapse entirely if its power severed from its vessel. That was his only chance. Determined, Tai Lung surged closer, flames blazing. He gathered every ounce of his chi and unleashed his greatest inferno yet, a wave of fire so massive it lit the misty sky like a second sun. The titan responded in kind, summoning a monstrous wall of water. They met in a thunderous collision, birthing another storm of blinding steam that blanketed the battlefield. This time, Tai Lung didn't hold back. He used the cover and dived headlong into the titan's head. The liquid flesh boiled and rippled under his entry as he tore through it, channeling fire without restraint. He pressed forward, eyes locked on the outline of the boy within. He was close, too close for hesitation. The water began to freeze around him, the spirit's ice defense clamping down like ice fangs. Snarling, Tai Lung pushed his body harder than ever, muscles straining, chi burning. He broke through the freezing wall, his fingers brushing against Aang's clothes. Without pause, he released a small, controlled bolt of lightning, weak compared to his earlier strikes but enough to shock the boy's body. The titan convulsed. The Avatar's body spasmed, and for the briefest moment the freezing ceased. Tai Lung roared, flooding the head with fire, searing a path as he grabbed Aang's limp form and burst free of the watery prison. It all happened in moments, too fast for any watching eyes to comprehend. From the mist, Tai Lung emerged, carrying the unconscious Avatar in his arms. Behind him, the great titan shuddered violently, its glowing form collapsing in torrents. The colossal spirit dissolved into rushing water, then nothing, vanishing back into the ocean from which it had risen. Tai Lung hovered in the sky, drenched and trembling, but victorious. He exhaled, relief coursing through him. [It worked. The spirit must have gone back to being nothing more than a stupid fish.] He descended slowly, landing atop the tallest building in the city, a perch that overlooked every street and every horrified face turned toward him. Water Tribe warriors stood frozen, their spears shaking in their hands, their eyes wide as they realized what they were seeing, the Avatar, limp in the fire monster's hand. Tai Lung held the boy up by the back of his clothes like a captured animal, his voice booming with chi across the city. \"Water Tribe! The battle is over. The Avatar and your ocean spirit have fallen before me. If you insist on pursuing the Fire Nation soldiers, you shall face me instead.\" His words echoed, silencing even the crash of waves. The warriors quailed, none daring to move. With a final glance, Tai Lung tossed Aang onto the rooftop, leaving him unconscious but unharmed. Without waiting for a response, he pointed his arms backward and soared away, fire propelling him toward the retreating fleet. The Water Tribe stood rooted in place, not daring to chase the monster who had shattered what can be described as a water god. Yet in truth, Tai Lung's strength was nearly spent. His flight wavered, his chi was reaching its limit. Battling an infinitely powerful spirit had drained him to the marrow. But he endured and found a path. In the end, victory was his.\n\nThe clash of elements shook the night. As the wall of water and torrent of fire collided midair, a violent hiss echoed across the frozen city.

The Avatar was already the most powerful bender alive, a vessel of countless lifetimes. The ocean spirit alone was a force of nature beyond comprehension. Together, empowered by the restored Moon Spirit, the sheer tide of chi radiating from the titan was unending, infinite.\n\nHe could feel it, an endless pool of power. He would never match such raw might. Attrition was hopeless. His only advantage lay in his speed, his agility, his size against the immense size of the spirit.\n\nHe could feel it, an endless pool of power. He would never match such raw might.

The waterbenders who moments before had been bending water and hurling ice at fleeing soldiers stopped, staring in awe at the battle between the fire bending master and the spirit titan. Even Fire Nation soldiers, retreating in fear and defeat, would pause to look back, their faces lit by bursts of blue fire against glowing water.\n\nThe spectacle was impossible to ignore.

Fire rained from the sky, water exploded upward in geysers, and steam boiled between them. Mist wrapped the streets, blanketing the fleeing masses, rising into the sky like a shroud.

            "content": "The Fire Nation fleet had retreated a safe distance from the Northern Water Tribe, their ships cutting across dark waters under the pale moon. Despite their retreat, the mood aboard the ships was nothing like defeat. The decks rang with laughter, cheers, and the pounding of fists against armor. Morale was soaring, soldiers burning with excitement as though they had claimed victory itself. Some of the younger troops begged their captains to turn the fleet around and resume the war. Others spoke with fiery eyes, claiming they could storm the ice walls a second time and win. The reason for this boundless spirit was the same across every ship, Tai Lung. They had seen him. One of their own, standing against the godly power of the Avatar. The ocean itself had risen, the Avatar fused with it somehow, and Tai Lung had met it blow for blow. He had soared like a comet of flame and lightning, shaking the sky with his strikes. And in the end, he had emerged victorious, carrying the Avatar's limp body as the titan collapsed. No longer was the Avatar the untouchable symbol of power. The soldiers spoke it as fact now: Tai Lung was the most powerful bender in the world. Some men even grumbled in frustration, confused why their champion had not pressed the advantage. With such strength, what force could possibly resist him? If the legendary Avatar could not stop him, then surely the Water Tribe could be crushed with ease. But their voices were born of ignorance. None of them saw the truth. Behind the strong front, Tai Lung was shattered. The fight had drained him. By the time he returned to the flagship, he had only enough strength to order the high ranking officers to pull back the fleet. After that, he vanished into his quarters without another word. There, away from the cheers of the soldiers, he collapsed into meditation, trying to rest and recover. —————— Early the next morning, General Iroh entered Tai Lung's quarters. He found the great warrior sitting cross-legged on the bed, his eyes closed, breath steady in disciplined rhythm. When Tai Lung finally opened them. \"What brings you here so early, General?\" Tai Lung asked quietly. Iroh smiled warmly, his hands folded behind his back. \"I came to check on you after last night's battle. You defeated the Avatar and the Ocean Spirit. You may very well be the strongest bender alive, perhaps even greater than the spirits.\" Tai Lung shook his head. \"The Avatar was nothing but a vessel. And the Ocean Spirit…\" He narrowed his eyes. \"It didn't know how to fight. If a beginner bender had been given its power, I would have been doomed. All of us would. The ocean is something else, its raw power is beyond me.\" Iroh gave a soft chuckle, though his eyes were serious. \"The ocean is a force of nature. In raw power, few things can match it.\" He paused then, his voice growing heavier, his gaze fixed on Tai Lung. \"You are strong, Tai Lung. Stronger than anyone I have ever seen. If you had joined the siege, the Water Tribe would have fallen. Even Ba Sing Se will fall if you lead the charge. And yet you are well known to avoid battles and only steps in for rescue. Why? You could gain so much honor and glory.\" For a long moment, Tai Lung said nothing. Then he looked into Iroh's eyes and replied firmly, \"That is not my destiny or my path. I want the betterment of myself, I don't need to be anything more, I don't wish to seek a great and glorious destiny. And in respect to my father's wishes, I am willing to protect the Fire Nation's people. But that is the limit of it. Conquering lands, winning wars, it is just not for me.\" Iroh studied him closely. \"Then what do you want? Have you thought of bringing balance back? Of seeking peace?\" Tai Lung replied \"I honestly don't know, but I know I am not worthy to be a bringer of peace or its guardian. And honestly, I don't see the war as entirely bad. Look at what it's brought us, our technology, our settlements, our riches. This doesn't mean I support war, it is just the world is living in a cycle, peace breeds war and war breeds peace, and me stopping it is just a temporary solution, the only thing I would be truly achieving is the betrayal of my parents and our people.\" \"Temorary… I suppose that is true. What do you think should be done to end this cycle?\" Iroh asked. Tai Lung gave a faint shrug. \"I don't know. I'm good at training and fighting. That is all I am good for.\" Iroh sighed softly. He turned to leave, but after a step, he stopped. His voice lowered as he asked one final question. \"You didn't kill the Avatar. Why? Do you think he could bring back peace and balance?\" Tai Lung's lips curved into a small smile. \"No, I don't think he is the solution. I didn't kill him just like I didn't kill any water bender, because simply I have no enmity with them, I also admit I want to face him when he masters the four elements. He is the strongest bender after all. It would be a shame if I never had the chance to challenge him at his peak.\" Iroh's smile returned \"Then I shall leave you to your rest.\" And with that, the Dragon of the West stepped out, leaving Tai Lung alone with his thoughts, his eyes drifting closed once more. —————— In stark contrast to the roaring morale of the Fire Nation fleet, the Northern Water Tribe found no comfort in their supposed victory. Though they had driven the invaders back, what lingered in their minds was not triumph, but dread. They had seen the impossible: the Avatar, in his divine fury, had faced a Fire Nation soldier and lost. That soldier was no ordinary man. He was a monster. The warriors of the tribe knew it in their bones. If that firebender, the one of burning blue flames, had stepped into the war from the beginning, they would have been doomed. No wall of ice, no group of benders, no prayers to Tui and La could have resisted such raw might. But he had not. For reasons unknown, the monster had only joined the fray at the end, to halt the Avatar and cover the retreat of his people. His motives were a mystery. Some whispered that perhaps attacking them was beneath him. Others prayed that whatever restraint held him away from battle would continue to bind him forever. Yet none were more shaken by Tai Lung's power than Aang and his companions. Even in the Avatar State and controlled by the Ocean Spirit's wrath, Aang had been aware of his surroundings. He remembered every clash, every strike and he remembered losing. The Ocean itself had not been enough. Tai Lung had torn him free from that divine union and cast the spirit back into the water. Katara and Sokka had no less fear carved into them. They had attacked that monster with everything they had, and he had nearly ended their lives in an instant, only sparing them at Iroh's plea. They couldn't understand his words, his reasoning, or his strange decisions. But one truth was undeniable: Tai Lung was no ordinary enemy. He was the true monster among the Fire Nation's ranks. What unsettled them most was his words after reviving the moon spirit. He had claimed it had cost him half of his strength. If that was true, then half of Tai Lung's power had already eclipsed the Avatar joined with the Ocean. How could anyone fight such a being? The three now sat in silence in their chamber, each lost in thought. The weight of the night event crushed them until Aang finally broke the stillness. \"Bumi was right,\" he whispered, his voice full of fear. \"Tai Lung is a monster that must be avoided. I… I don't know if I could ever beat him, even if I mastered all four elements.\" Neither Katara nor Sokka replied at first. The silence stretched until, at last, Sokka muttered, \"That thing has inhuman strength and speed. He can fly. He can unleash seas of blue fire, summon lightning, even bring spirits back to life. There's no way Tai Lung is a human.\" Katara gave a faint nod, her lips trembling. \"But why didn't he join the battle? He revived the moon, then fought Aang and spared him, and then he just… left. Why?\" \"You heard him,\" Sokka answered grimly. \"He sees the moon as something important for the world. And he… he likes challenges. Maybe he wants to fight Aang only after he's mastered all four elements.\" Aang swallowed hard, his throat dry. He didn't want to believe it, the thought of facing Tai Lung in earnest made him shiver. He still saw flashes of the man in his mind. \"What should we do, then?\" Katara asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Aang lowered his head. \"I don't know. I think the only thing we can do is continue our journey. I have to learn the four elements… it's the only chance I'll ever have to bring balance back to the world.\" Sokka lifted his gaze, then sighed. \"I've been thinking… I might stay here. With Yue.\" His words hit Katara and Aang like a blow. \"You can't be serious!\" Katara snapped, her eyes wide. \"Are you going to abandon Aang just like that?\" Sokka's expression hardened. \"And maybe you should, too. We said we'd accompany Aang to the North, and we did. Our promise is fulfilled.\" \"He still has two elements to master!\" Katara shot back. Sokka shook his head. \"And what happens if we encounter Tai Lung again? Aang might not be able to save himself, let alone us.\" Katara fell silent at that, her chest tightening. She could still feel Tai Lung's burning grip around her throat, the cold gleam of his golden eyes. Aang looked down at his hands. \"Sokka's right. I don't want to put you in danger. If Tai Lung ever came after you because of me… I'd never forgive myself.\" Katara's anger faded into sorrow. She looked between Aang and Sokka, her voice trembling but firm. \"That's stupid. What if that monster comes back here? What if he attacks the Northern Water Tribe again? What if he went after Yue? With him around, nowhere in the world is safe. Unless you master all four elements, Aang… we'll always be at his mercy. Sokka, if you want to have a chance to live peacefully with Yue, Aang must master the four elements and defeat Tai Lung\" Aang raised his head. Slowly, he nodded, his eyes burning with a new determination. Sokka hesitated but nodded at last. No place is safe.\n\nThe Fire Nation fleet had retreated a safe distance from the Northern Water Tribe, their ships cutting across dark waters under the pale moon.

I want the betterment of myself, I don't need to be anything more, I don't wish to seek a great and glorious destiny.

            "content": "The Fire Nation fleet was split, scattered after the events of the North Pole siege. While the majority of the ships turned their prows toward home, Tai Lung had other plans. He directed his ship away from the returning fleet, ordering his crew to chart a course for the Earth Kingdom. His destination was to the circus, he intended to visit Ty Lee. Another ship split from the fleet as well. Prince Zuko, still banished, demanded to continue his mission of hunting the Avatar. Thanks to General Iroh's enduring prestige as the Dragon of the West, the new commander of the fleet reluctantly granted Zuko his own vessel. And so, the greatest Fire Nation armada story came to an end. It took several days for Tai Lung's ship to reach the Earth Kingdom coast. The moment his boots touched the ground, his crew began making preparations to sail back to the Fire Nation. \"This is a personal matter, not a military one,\" they told him before boarding once more. Tai Lung could only shake his head with a low chuckle at their eagerness to go back home while completely disregarding their captain. Tai Lung focused on his mission, finding Ty Lee. It was not immediate. It took him days of asking around, following directions, and tracing the traveling paths of the circus. Finally, his search ended at a clearing where the colorful tents rose high against the trees. There, outside the performers' quarters, he spotted her. Ty Lee was practicing in the open air, her body folding and bending in impossible arcs of flexibility. A white mask covered half of her face, obscuring her scar. \"Hi, Ty Lee,\" Tai Lung called as he approached, his deep voice breaking the rhythm of her movements. \"How are you?\" Ty Lee froze mid-stretch, her eyes widening in surprise. The mask did little to hide the sudden light in them. With a cheerful cry, she sprang forward, wrapping her arms around him in a tight embrace. \"I missed you! Why didn't you write to me that you were coming?\" Tai Lung returned her hug briefly before pulling back. \"I joined an operation in the north,\" he explained. \"I didn't know when it would end. I came here as soon as I was done.\" As he spoke, his gaze lingered on the mask covering her face. His expression hardened. \"Why are you wearing that half mask?\" Ty Lee's joy faltered. She lowered her head, her voice quieter when she replied. \"It's… better for business.\" Tai Lung's frown deepened. \"That's dumb. Your face is good as it is. Who manages this circus? I'd like to have a word with him.\" For a moment she looked startled, then broke into a laugh, though it was tinged with nervousness. \"I'm glad you think that way, but I'm fine like this, really. What matters is that the people I care about don't care about my face.\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed, but he let it drop with a low growl of disapproval. \"Fine. But remember, if you grow sick of them, let me know. I can straighten their behavior for you.\" Ty Lee laughed at his words. The following days passed in a calm rhythm. Tai Lung lingered around the circus. He traveled with the troupe, watched their shows, trained alongside Ty Lee, and accompanied her to nearby settlements and villages. When it came to sharing stories, it was mostly Ty Lee who spoke, her voice full of laughter and mischief, while Tai Lung listened in his quiet way. Two weeks later, the two were sparring on an open field. No bending, just pure hand-to-hand combat. Ty Lee darted around him with her usual acrobatic grace, striking and flipping, while Tai Lung blocked her blows with ease. During the exchange, he spoke between movements. \"Do you plan to stay in the circus forever?\" \"Yes,\" Ty Lee answered brightly, ducking under his swing. \"I think it's my calling. I get to travel around and enjoy all the scenery.\" \"My offer to join my crew is still open,\" Tai Lung countered, catching her wrist and releasing it just as quickly. \"We travel all the time, and to be frank, the circus could never match us. We go all over the world, and we rarely join battles.\" Ty Lee hesitated, rolling back on her hands before springing upright again. \"But… is that really fine? You're a soldier. I'm just a civilian at the end of the day.\" Tai Lung scoffed, his smirk dismissive. \"What I say goes. Who's going to object? The Fire Lord? I'll beat him up if he dares to open his mouth about it.\" Ty Lee laughed, covering her mouth. \"Don't let anyone hear you, that's treason.\" \"No worries,\" Tai Lung said with a smirk. \"When I'm done with him, it won't be.\" Her laughter came harder this time, full of amusement. \"Fine, I'll join, but let's not leave before today's show. I'd feel bad leaving the circus right before it.\" Tai Lung gave a satisfied nod. But before the day could end, they received an unexpected visitor. A litter carried by royal guards arrived at the circus grounds, and when the curtains parted, out stepped Princess Azula of the Fire Nation. She froze for the briefest moment when she saw Ty Lee and Tai Lung standing side by side. \"Azula!\" Ty Lee cried with delight. She charged forward and hugged the princess tightly. Azula allowed the embrace, offering a rare smile. \"It's nice to see you too, Ty Lee.\" Her golden eyes then shifted toward Tai Lung. \"I didn't expect to find you here after what you did in the north. The entire nation speaks of nothing else.\" Tai Lung walked toward them at an unhurried pace. \"I originally planned to visit Ty Lee,\" he said casually. \"But Father insisted I follow Zhao, just in case.\" Ty Lee blinked, curiosity flashing in her eyes. \"Wait, what did Tai do in the north?\" Azula arched a brow at him, surprised. \"You didn't tell her?\" Tai Lung shrugged. \"She's not interested in war-related topics.\" \"Well,\" Ty Lee said, folding her arms, \"now I'm interested. What is this about?\" Azula's expression softened into one of calculation. \"Let's sit somewhere first.\" They found a quiet spot near the circus tents, where Azula recounted the tale as it was told in the capital. How Tai Lung had fought the Avatar in his Avatar State. How the Avatar commanded the ocean itself, and still lost to Tai Lung. She described the retreat of the Fire Nation fleet, and how Tai Lung's intervention saved countless soldiers. Tai Lung listened in silence, noting to himself that while much of it was true, the retelling painted him as if he had emerged with strength to spare, when in reality, he had been utterly drained. The story had made him sound unstoppable, capable of crushing the North entirely along the Avatar if he wished. Ty Lee looked at him with wide-eyed amazement. Azula, however, leaned forward. \"You could have captured or killed the Avatar. You could have conquered the North. But instead you retreated. The war council is furious.\" \"I don't want to conquer lands or win battles,\" Tai Lung said simply. \"I only stepped in to help our soldiers escape. That's all. And I have no plans to change how I act anytime soon.\" Azula's sharp gaze lingered on him, unconvinced, though she didn't press further. She knew better than to antagonize this monster. Instead, she turned her attention back to Ty Lee. \"I'm on a mission…\" she said. She explained that she had been sent to capture Zuko and Iroh and bring them home under the Fire Lord's orders. She needed help, and so she had come for Ty Lee. Ty Lee's face fell. \"I'm sorry, Azula. I am going to join Tai Lung's crew.\" Azula's brow furrowed. \"But you're not a soldier.\" \"I'm inviting her,\" Tai Lung interrupted, his tone casual but final. \"If someone has a problem with her, they can always find me.\" Azula's eye twitched at his blatant disregard for authority. He was doing whatever he pleased, and she knew no one dared oppose him, not even her father. \"You can always go with Tai Lung later,\" she said, her voice firm. \"This is my first mission away from home, Ty Lee, and I need all the help I can get.\" Ty Lee hesitated, torn. On one hand, she wanted to leave with Tai Lung. On the other hand, she didn't want to let Azula down. Meanwhile, Tai Lung's brow furrowed. \"Why do you need help to bring your brother and uncle back? Just send some letter or ask around our bases and your are done\" Azula sighed, her mask of confidence cracking for a heartbeat. \"They're being brought back against their will to avoid bringing shame to the royal family.\" Tai Lung tilted his head, not understanding the thought process here. His thoughts drifted toward the Fire Lord's less-than-stellar reputation as he stared at Azula with a questioning gaze. She stiffened, able to guess exactly what he was thinking. If it weren't for the fact that he was far too strong, she might have struck him down with lightning where he stood.\n\nThe Fire Nation fleet was split, scattered after the events of the North Pole siege. While the majority of the ships turned their prows toward home, Tai Lung had other plans. He directed his ship away from the returning fleet, ordering his crew to chart a course for the Earth Kingdom. His destination was to the circus, he intended to visit Ty Lee.\n\nThe Fire Nation fleet was split, scattered after the events of the North Pole siege.

Thanks to General Iroh's enduring prestige as the Dragon of the West, the new commander of the fleet reluctantly granted Zuko his own vessel.

And so, the greatest Fire Nation armada story came to an end.\n\nIt took several days for Tai Lung's ship to reach the Earth Kingdom coast. The moment his boots touched the ground, his crew began making preparations to sail back to the Fire Nation. \"This is a personal matter, not a military one,\" they told him before boarding once more. Tai Lung could only shake his head with a low chuckle at their eagerness to go back home while completely disregarding their captain.\n\nIt took several days for Tai Lung's ship to reach the Earth Kingdom coast.

It was not immediate. It took him days of asking around, following directions, and tracing the traveling paths of the circus. Finally, his search ended at a clearing where the colorful tents rose high against the trees. There, outside the performers' quarters, he spotted her. Ty Lee was practicing in the open air, her body folding and bending in impossible arcs of flexibility. A white mask covered half of her face, obscuring her scar.\n\nTai Lung focused on his mission, finding Ty Lee. It was not immediate.

But remember, if you grow sick of them, let me know. I can straighten their behavior for you.\"\n\nTai Lung's eyes narrowed, but he let it drop with a low growl of disapproval. \"Fine.

            "content": "Ignoring Tai Lung entirely, Azula turned her focus back to the still-hesitant Ty Lee. \"I was planning to fetch Mai after you,\" she said smoothly. \"She's in the Earth Kingdom after all, and the three of us could be together again. We haven't met since we left the Royal Fire Academy for Girls.\" Ty Lee's eyes brightened instantly. \"Mai is here?\" \"She and her family came to the Earth Kingdom,\" Tai Lung answered before Azula could. \"Her father was put in charge of managing a district of settlements and villages or something along those lines.\" Azula shook her head then corrected Tai Lung. \"Your information is outdated. Her father is no mere administrator anymore. He's the city lord of Omashu.\" Tai Lung raised a brow at that. \"I didn't hear of any invasion toward the city. Nor that we conquered it.\" Azula shrugged as though it were of no consequence. \"We were assembling a full invasion force at the same time as the North Pole siege fleet. The war council expected a bloody battle, and instead the mad king, Bumi, surrendered the city without a fight out of nowhere; I guess he knew the futility of resisting the inevitable.\" At that, Tai Lung fell quiet. He remembered the mad old king well, Bumi, despite his age, was the most skilled earthbender Tai had ever crossed paths with. His forces weren't weak either. Omashu had resisted Fire Nation pressure for over a century. For the king to simply surrender… it made no sense. What was he thinking? Azula's eyes sharpened as she returned to her true goal. \"So,\" she said, turning to Ty Lee, \"what do you think? Will you come with me?\" Ty Lee hesitated, her gaze flickering toward Tai Lung before returning to Azula. \"I'm really sorry, Azula,\" she said softly, \"but I want to travel with Tai Lung. I wish you the best of luck on your mission.\" Azula's hand clenched tightly at her side. She had come here fully expecting Ty Lee to accept. Even if she hadn't, Azula had other ways of persuasion. But with Tai Lung standing beside Ty Lee, she could do nothing. In the end, Azula forced a thin smile. \"It's fine, Ty Lee. I understand. It was nice seeing you again.\" She turned on her heel, her guards falling in behind her. \"Why not stay the night?\" Ty Lee called quickly. \"I have a performance piece tonight.\" Azula didn't turn back. \"I have a mission to finish. I've already wasted enough time coming here.\" And just like that, she was gone. Ty Lee stood there, troubled, watching her retreating figure. She looked up at Tai Lung. \"Azula is my friend… and I turned her down, and she looked disappointed and sad. Do you think I made a mistake?\" \"No, not really,\" Tai Lung said flatly. \"Her mission is ridiculous to begin with. The Fire Lord, Ozai, is worried about the royal family's reputation. I don't understand where he gets the audacity and shamelessness to send her on such a mission.\" Ty Lee chuckled at his bluntness, her worry easing slightly. After a moment, she asked, \"Is it okay if we set off to Omashu tomorrow?\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed slightly. \"Do you want to help Azula?\" Ty Lee shook her head quickly. \"No. I just want to visit Mai, assuming she hasn't already left with Azula. Besides… I've never been to Omashu before. Or any major Earth city.\" \"I have no objection,\" Tai Lung replied. \"I haven't visited Omashu either. I heard they have some kind of unique mailing system there.\" Ty Lee's face lit up with a smile. \"Thanks, Tai.\" —————— The city of Omashu lay beneath a haze of smoke and industry, its streets quiet but tense under Fire Nation control. At the heart of the city, in the chamber of the once-proud city lord, and upon the high chair where authority was meant to rest, Azula sat with a poise that was both regal and suffocating. Before her, the city lord and his family, Mai's family, kowtowed, their foreheads pressed to the floor. The silence was broken only when Mai's father, with his voice trembling despite his efforts at composure, dared to look up. \"I apologize,\" he began, his words uncertain in the presence of the princess. \"You came to Omashu at a difficult time. At noon, we are arranging a trade with the resistance to retrieve Tom-Tom.\" Azula's eyes, sharp and unblinking, turned on him with disdain. \"Yes,\" she said, her voice clipped and dripping with mock sympathy. \"I am so sorry to hear about your son. But really, what did you expect by letting all the citizens leave?\" She rose, her expression as cold as steel, and her words cut sharper than any blade. \"My father entrusted this city to you, and you are making a mess of things.\" The weight of her accusation scared Mai's father, he collapsed into a deeper bow, his voice strained as he repeated, \"I apologize, Princess.\" Azula stepped forward, passing by the groveling figures without another glance. \"You will stay here,\" she ordered flatly. \"Mai will handle the hostage situation. That way, you won't have another chance to ruin anything else.\" Behind her, Mai stood without protest. She followed Azula out in silence, her expression unreadable. As they walked through the corridors of Omashu's palace, Azula's voice broke the silence, low and edged with annoyance. \"It would be useful to have Ty Lee at times like this. But she chose to stick with Tai Lung. I still cannot believe she would rather wander around with him than come here.\" Mai cast a sidelong glance at her. The irritation was clear in Azula's tone, but Mai's own reply was delivered in her usual, dry calm. \"The two rarely see each other as it is, Tai is always traveling. And you know how insecure Ty Lee is about her face. Tai was the only one who never minded the scar or reacted to it.\" Azula's steps faltered just slightly, her mind tugged unwillingly toward memory. The assassination attempt. Her own guard had betrayed her, and though the assassination meant for her had failed, Ty Lee had not walked away unscathed. A scar now marred her friend's face, Azula had always suspected Ty Lee deep down had blamed her for it. Sometimes, even Azula would have a flicker of guilt when she saw Ty Lee's face. But what she could never quite grasp was how Tai Lung bore it so easily, how he seemed to look past such a disfigurement without the slightest care. It baffled her. And part of her felt jealous of Ty Lee. She, the princess of the fire nation, had no one that genuinely cared about her like Ty Lee. But Azula dismissed the thought as fast as it got into her head. There were more pressing matters. First, the hostage trade. Then, her uncle and her brother. —————— When the sun reached its peak, the two sides met for the trade. At the tallest structure in the city, a building now crowned with scaffolding for the statue of Fire Lord Ozai, Azula and Mai stood side by side, staring ahead. Behind them hung a cage of iron, more coffin than prison, swaying from a heavy chain. Through the narrow window, the unmistakable face of King Bumi peered out, his wild grin unbothered even in captivity. On the other side, three figures walked forward, carrying with them the small, innocently laughing child Tom-Tom. The shortest of the three stepped forward, his voice firm but cautious. \"We are ready to trade.\" Azula's smile was thin, sharp, and cruel. \"I am sorry,\" she spoke, \"but a thought just occurred to me. It hardly seems fair to trade a two-year-old child for an old king, one of the strongest earthbenders in the world.\" Mai's eyes flicked to her brother. For a moment, there was a change in her expression. Then, coolly, she stepped forward and said, \"You are right, princess. The deal is off.\" The decision was made. Azula surged forward, blue fire erupting from her hands, lashing toward the trio. The captors' faces turned to horror. The boy with the staff swung it, unleashing a sudden, powerful gust of air. The girl moved fluidly, bending every drop of water she carried, sending it forward in full force. The third, clutching Tom-Tom in desperation, hurled his boomerang into the fray. The attacks collided midair with Azula's blazing fire. For an instant, the attacks of the two sides clashed and came to a halt. Then the combined force pierced through the fire, hitting Azula and driving her back. She flipped midair, landing with grace, her narrowed eyes fixing on the trio once more. But they were gone. \"They escaped,\" Mai murmured, her tone as flat as ever. \"I know you're terrifying, but what did you do to them to make them run like that? I've never seen anyone flee so fast.\" Azula's expression hardened, though a flicker of confusion passed through her eyes. \"I am not sure. But just now, that was airbending. The boy with the staff… he is the Avatar.\" Behind them, in his iron cage, King Bumi had been chuckling the entire time. Yet even his laughter faltered as his eyes widened in surprise. His old friend had run so fast, so abruptly, that even he was left stunned. He had planned to tell Aang to leave him behind. But Aang had not even attempted a rescue.\n\nIgnoring Tai Lung entirely, Azula turned her focus back to the still-hesitant Ty Lee. \"I was planning to fetch Mai after you,\" she said smoothly. \"She's in the Earth Kingdom after all, and the three of us could be together again. We haven't met since we left the Royal Fire Academy for Girls.\"\n\nIgnoring Tai Lung entirely, Azula turned her focus back to the still-hesitant Ty Lee. \"I was planning to fetch Mai after you,\" she said smoothly. \"She's in the Earth Kingdom after all, and the three of us could be together again.

            "content": "For a long moment after the escape, silence lingered over the city's highest point. The cage still swayed slightly from its chain, and the unfinished statue of Fire Lord Ozai loomed above them. Then, at last, Bumi's chuckling voice broke through, his tone almost enlightened, as though he had reached some grand revelation. \"Ah, I know why they escaped,\" the old king announced. Both Azula and Mai turned their heads toward him, curiosity flickering in their eyes despite themselves. Bumi grinned through the small window in the iron coffin. \"It's the blue fire,\" he said cheerfully. \"I believe they thought you were that terrifying firebender, Tai Lung.\" Azula's eyes narrowed. But Bumi wasn't finished. He gave her a look full of mock pity, his voice lowering into something almost fatherly. \"They must have mistaken you for him. No offense, but you look nothing like a girl, let alone a princess. Anyone could confuse you for a boy. I suggest you take better care of yourself.\" For a beat, Azula and Mai both froze, blinking in disbelief at the rudeness of his words. Then Azula's face darkened, her fury barely restrained. \"I will throw you deep into the prison,\" she hissed, her hand raised with lethal precision. \"So deep that the sunlight will never see you again.\" At her signal, the chain above groaned and began retracting, lifting Bumi's prison upward then into the shadows of a rocky tower nearby. His laughter echoed until it was swallowed by the dark. Mai stood silently at her side. After a pause, she finally said, her tone flat as stone, \"Don't take his words seriously. He's just a senile old man.\" Azula turned her glare upon her companion. \"I am not. As if I would accept his words. The only thing that might be true is the blue fire, the Avatar and his companions must have thought I am like Tai Lung due to the blue fire\" Mai inclined her head in calm acknowledgment, her face expressionless, then asked \"Why is the Avatar afraid of Tai Lung?\". —————— Far below, in the abandoned slums of Omashu's lower levels, three figures leaned against walls, catching their breath. Aang, Katara, and Sokka huddled in an abandoned building, their chests rising and falling heavily from the escape. \"There's a second monster among the Fire Nation ranks,\" Aang said at last, his voice shaken. \"She has blue fire.\" Katara's hands tightened around her water flask, her face pale. \"Tai Lung was already a walking disaster. What are we supposed to do now that there are two of them? How did the Fire Nation even raise monsters like them?\" Sokka frowned, scratching the back of his head as though working through a theory. \"Maybe that girl is his sister?\" Aang shook his head. \"It doesn't matter now. What matters is finding a way to save Bumi while avoiding her.\" \"That's too dangerous!\" Sokka cut in sharply. \"If we get caught by her, it'll be the end of us.\" Katara nodded firmly, her voice quiet but urgent. \"She is too dangerous, Aang. We barely got away. Next time we won't be so lucky.\" Aang hesitated, his eyes downcast. His fists clenched at his sides. \"But we can't just leave. I need an earthbending teacher and Bumi is the best choice.\" Sokka met his gaze with unflinching seriousness. \"I'm sorry, Aang. But we have to leave Omashu. We can't risk it anymore. And now… they know you're here.\" The words struck heavily in Aang's chest. He lowered his head, silent, the decision weighing on him like stone. Deep inside, he knew Sokka was right. Staying was impossible, not with a second Tai Lung, another blue-fire monster guarding the city. At last, shoulders slumped, Aang turned toward the darkened sewer tunnels of Omashu. Without another word, the Avatar and his companions slipped away into the dirty hole they came from. —————— Three days later, Tai Lung and Ty Lee finally arrived at Omashu. To Ty Lee's disappointment, they learned that Azula had already departed a day earlier, taking Mai with her to track not only her uncle and brother but also the Avatar. With little else to do, the pair spent a full day exploring the captured city before deciding to set off once more, wandering aimlessly across the conquered lands of the Earth Kingdom. With the fall of Omashu, only Ba Sing Se, the great walled capital, remained as the last standing city of the Earth Kingdom. Every other stronghold had fallen under Fire Nation control. Here and there, small resistance bands persisted, but none posed a true threat to the Fire Nation's growing power. Their journey stretched on for nearly two months. They drifted steadily northward until, at last, they arrived at a large military base near the Yanhai River. The broad river flowed west of Ba Sing Se toward the south where they came from. What awaited them there made both Tai Lung and Ty Lee stop in their tracks. Standing beside the base was a massive construct of iron, the largest machine either of them had ever seen. A monstrosity of metal loomed before them, terrible and awe-inspiring. Tai Lung and Ty Lee continued toward the main gate and as they approached, Tai Lung said \"I am Captain Tai Lung.\" The soldiers on guard stiffened at once. At the sound of his name, their bodies tensed, eyes widening. One among them stepped forward, voice steady but cautious. \"Sir, could you please provide proof of identity?\" Tai Lung raised one hand. A flicker of pale flame burst to life in his palm,blue fire. The soldier instantly bowed respectfully. \"It is an honor to meet you, sir. We have all heard of your battle at the North Pole.\" Tai Lung allowed the flame to die before speaking, his tone measured. \"What is that giant machine standing there?\" The soldier straightened and followed his gaze. \"That, sir, is a drill. A giant war machine designed to pierce through the walls of Ba Sing Se.\" Tai Lung gave a low hum. \"So there is a plan to mount an attack on the city.\" \"Yes,\" the soldier confirmed. \"The War Minister Cheng and Princess Azula herself will both be leading the invasion force.\" At once, Ty Lee's eyes lit up with delight. \"Oh! Azula is here? That means Mai as well! Let's go meet them!\" The soldiers exchanged uneasy glances. This scarred girl had spoken the princess's name so casually it almost seemed disrespectful. Their looks did not escape Tai Lung's notice. \"Ty Lee is my fiance,\" he explained to guards \"And a close friend of the princess.\" That was enough. The soldiers bowed lightly to Ty Lee at once. \"We apologize for not recognizing you, Lady Ty Lee\" Ty Lee waved her hand with a cheerful little shake. \"It's okay, guys. I don't hold any titles, you don't need to be so formal with me.\" Her easygoing warmth drew smiles from the men. The leading soldier straightened and said respectfully, \"Allow me to lead you to Princess Azula's quarters.\" And so Tai Lung and Ty Lee followed, walking side by side behind their guide. Along the way, the soldier could not help but express his awe and respect toward Tai Lung, recounting the stories he had heard of the Northern Siege and asking questions. Ty Lee listened with a smile to the soldier. A few minutes later, the soldier led Tai Lung and Ty Lee to a well-kept, single-story building on the quieter side of the base. He bowed respectfully before leaving them at the door. Tai Lung pushed it open, and the two stepped into a modest living room. The space was plain, furnished only with essentials. At the far end, a corridor stretched deeper inside, leading to several rooms. \"Azula? Mai? Are you here?\" Ty Lee called out brightly. From the corridor, Azula emerged in her sharp military uniform. For once, her mask of composure slipped, surprise flashing in her eyes. \"Ty Lee! What are you doing here?\" Ty Lee hurried forward with a smile. \"We were going to mount a ship from this base and head back south, but when I found out you were here, I wanted to say hi. Where's Mai? Is she here?\" Azula gave a small nod, then turned. \"Follow me.\" Ty Lee trailed after her instantly, while Tai Lung kept two steps behind. Azula led them into one of the rooms branching off the corridor. The moment Ty Lee entered, she froze. Mai lay on the bed, both her legs wrapped thickly in bandages. Her face was paler than usual, her expression even gloomier than the detached calm she normally wore. Ty Lee gasped and rushed to her side. \"What happened to you?\" Mai lifted her eyes to Ty Lee's but said nothing. Azula answered instead. \"While we were following the Avatar's trail, Mai engaged his companions. While she was occupied, the Avatar's bison came from behind and blasted her into the rocks, breaking her legs.\" Ty Lee's eyes widened in shock. She clasped Mai's hand tightly. \"I'm so sorry that happened to you, but cheer up! I'm sure you'll recover in no time.\" Mai averted her gaze, offering no reply. Azula's voice cut in, with a quite restrained tone. \"The healers think she might not be able to walk again.\" Tears welled in Ty Lee's eyes. She bit her lip, her voice trembling. \"I'm so sorry… I should have come with Azula. I could have helped.\" Finally, Mai sighed and turned her head back. \"You don't know that. Maybe I'd still be crippled all the same… or you would be in my place.\" For a moment, silence lingered in the room. Then Tai Lung's voice came. \"Ty Lee,\" he said firmly, stepping forward. \"Step away from Mai. I might be able to help her.\" All three girls looked at him in confusion, but Ty Lee obeyed, sliding back. Tai Lung knelt at Mai's bedside. Without another word, he placed his hands over her bandaged legs. A faint warm soft golden glow spread from his palms. The light seeped into her injured legs. A full minute passed, then, just as suddenly, the glow faded. Tai Lung stood up again. \"Try to move now,\" he instructed. Mai blinked, uncertain, but did as told. She shifted her legs then gasped. They moved. Slowly, hesitantly, she swung them over the bed's edge. With her friends watching in silence, Mai pushed herself up and stood. Her eyes widened. She was standing. Her legs, broken just moments ago, were now fully healed.\n\nFor a long moment after the escape, silence lingered over the city's highest point. The cage still swayed slightly from its chain, and the unfinished statue of Fire Lord Ozai loomed above them.\n\nFor a long moment after the escape, silence lingered over the city's highest point.

Standing beside the base was a massive construct of iron, the largest machine either of them had ever seen. A monstrosity of metal loomed before them, terrible and awe-inspiring.\n\nWhat awaited them there made both Tai Lung and Ty Lee stop in their tracks.

            "content": "The three girls stared at Tai Lung in shock. Mai asked, \"What did you do?\" Tai Lung replied calmly, \"The chi is the source of life. I gave you my chi which improved your body and accelerated your healing.\" Azula narrowed her eyes. \"I have never heard of such a thing.\" \"The Water Tribe does something similar,\" Tai Lung explained, \"but they use water as a medium.\" Azula just stared at him, speechless, and so did the other two. Every time they thought they began to understand his power and skill set, he surprised them with something new. After some time of silence, Ty Lee finally said, \"That's amazing, Tai. But… if you can heal, can't you heal my face?\" Tai Lung shook his head. \"I give my chi to help the body recover, it just accelerates the natural process of healing. Wounds heal, yes, but scars will remain behind, no matter how faint.\" Ty Lee pressed on, her voice soft but pleading. \"Can we try it at least? Please?\" Seeing her begging look, Tai Lung nodded and walked closer. He raised his hand, placing it gently on her scarred face. Once again, the same golden light glowed warmly, enveloping Ty Lee's features. A minute later, the light faded. Tai Lung withdrew his hand. \"This is the limit of how much chi can help you. I admit I didn't expect anything.\" Ty Lee looked at Tai Lung, then at Azula and Mai. \"It is not gone,\" Azula remarked, tilting her head, \"but I guess that's an improvement.\" Mai silently pulled out a dagger and handed it to Ty Lee. \"This is the closest thing I have to a mirror.\" Ty Lee took the dagger and peered at her reflection. The jarring scar was still there, but it was less visible than before, fainter, softer. Even still, it was a lot better than before. She looked up at Tai Lung, who quickly said, \"The scar would have faded in the same manner within a few years or so. My chi just hastened that.\" Ty Lee hugged him tightly. \"Thank you, thank you. This is more than I dreamed of. You are the best.\" Tai Lung stood there for a moment without responding, then hugged her back lightly. \"No problem.\" He silently noted to himself that he should have tried first before drawing conclusions. —————— Far from the military base and near Ba Sing Se, Aang and his team sat resting before crossing the Serpent's Pass. Toph, bored out of her mind, suddenly asked, \"So, you guys have been running from the fire princess like crazy, but I never got to ask why. Sure, she's a tough one, but for you to be that scared of her, what did she do to terrify you so much?\" Aang and the group looked at each other for a moment. Then Katara spoke, \"It was the blue fire. We thought she was another monster like Tai Lung.\" Sokka interrupted, \"I actually thought she was his sister. Who would have thought she was the sister of the angry prince?\" Toph tilted her head with interest. \"Who is Tai Lung, and how strong is he to scare all of you like that?\" Katara's voice grew heavy. \"He is a literal monster. If he was the one hunting us, I don't think there is any chance of escaping him. Only Aang, after mastering the four elements, might be able to fight him.\" Toph grinned. \"He sounds really strong. I would like to face him.\" Sokka shook his head. \"You don't understand. The word strong doesn't even describe him. If you compare him to the princess then it is like comparing a tiny kitten to a dragon. If the princess could throw a fireball the size of a boulder at you, that monster will throw a mountain-sized fireball. He could turn you into ashes in an instant.\" Toph laughed. \"As if I would believe that.\" But as she laughed, she paused, the silence of her companions spoke on its own. Katara finally said, \"Toph, I think we should start over and tell you everything we have seen in the North Pole. And before we start, this is no joke. Everything we will tell you is true.\" —————— Five days later, the Drill was approaching Ba Sing Se. Flanked by tens of the Fire Nation Tanks on both sides, it set toward the Earth Capital the next day after Mai's healing. Inside the drill's control room, the war minister stood giving orders to the operators, while Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai sat comfortably on their chairs. Ty Lee had insisted on accompanying her friends this time, stating she wouldn't let her friend get hurt again. Tai Lung, despite not wanting to have anything to do with this invasion force, chose to tag along to ensure Ty Lee and Mai safety, but instead of staying with Ty Lee in the control room, he went on and took over some random engineer room, deciding to meditate there alone. The invasion succeeding or failing had nothing to do with him. In the control room, Ty Lee looked at the not so happy Azula and said, \"At least he agreed to come. If things go wrong, we can depend on him to help us retreat.\" Azula grumbled, \"What is the point of having so much power if you don't use it? I can't understand why he refuses to fully participate in war. He is literally a one man army.\" The war minister, who was hearing this, spoke confidently. \"Princess, I assure you we don't need the assistance of Captain Lung. This drill has a penetration and destructive power far beyond what a firebender could possibly have, including Captain Lung. And it is fully built of metal, it is too big, heavy, and sturdy, a natural counter for the earthbender.\" The minister's words didn't improve Azula's mood. Tai Lung's actions irked her to no end; he did what he wanted and had no respect for the royal family. And despite all of that, no one dared to oppose him. Even putting his power aside, punishing him is still impossible as the entire nation views him as a national hero and respects him. She broke out of her thoughts when Ty Lee, who was looking through the spyglasses of the drill, said, \"A group of muscly earthbenders are coming our way.\" The war minister spoke, \"As I said, the drill is earthbender-proof. Nothing to worry about.\" Azula looked at the minister and said coldly, \"Can you take responsibility if anything went wrong based on your words?\" The minister hesitated to answer. Azula smirked. \"I thought as much. Ty Lee, Mai, go get rid of the enemies.\" Both girls stood, smiling. Mai wanted to let some steam off after her injury, while Ty Lee wanted to try fighting, it had been a long while since she fought anyone beside Tai Lung. A few minutes later the two girls returned. Mai's expression was as flat as ever, but there was an edge of annoyance in her tone. \"Ty Lee didn't leave anyone for me,\" she said. Ty Lee gave an apologetic little smile. \"I'm sorry, but I am used to sparring with Tai, I forgot how to fight normal people\" she explained sheepishly. Mai sighed. —————— While the Drill creeped ever closer to the outer walls of Ba Sing Se, far above, preparations were already being made to stop it. General Sung, one of the Council of Five, the highest ranking generals in the Earth Kingdom, stood in command. Around him clustered several soldiers, grim and tense, and beside them the Avatar and his companions. A weary soldier had just stumbled back from the field, still white-faced with terror as he reported to them. His words poured out like a flood. He described with horror how the elite team, Terra, handpicked and feared for their skill, had been utterly dismantled by a strange girl. She bore a scar on her face, he said, and moved with an inhuman speed and skill, crushing their ranks one by one. With his voice shaking, he told them how her fists seemed to drain the very strength from their bodies, soldiers left gasping, bending abilities snuffed out like candles, others left rigid, paralyzed, unable to move even a finger. General Sung's face darkened with disbelief. \"Where did the Fire Nation get someone like that?\" he demanded, his voice rising. \"What in the name of the spirits did she do to my elite soldiers?\" Sokka's eyes darted uneasily from the shaken soldier to the rest of his group. \"How come the Fire Nation has so many scary girls?\" he burst out. \"First the princess with fire like Tai Lung, then there's that gloomy one with endless hidden weapons, and now a girl who can take away bending and paralyze people!\" No one answered him. They only stared, though each of them wore the same troubled expression. The truth was bitter: when their journey had begun, their thoughts had fixed firmly on the Fire Lord as their ultimate adversary. Yet now it was clear, the most difficult part might not be defeating him at all, but facing the freaks who served beneath him. General Sung turned to look at Aang said \"Young Avatar, you are our only hope, please help us stop that metal monstrosity\" Aang nodded with a serious face then turned to look at his friends as his face turned to that of doubt. \"How do we stop that thing?\" Aang asked.\n\nThe three girls stared at Tai Lung in shock.\n\nThe three girls stared at Tai Lung in shock.\n\nThe three girls stared at Tai Lung in shock.\n\nMai asked, \"What did you do?\"\n\nMai asked, \"What did you do?\"\n\nMai asked, \"What did you do?\"\n\nTai Lung replied calmly, \"The chi is the source of life.

            "content": "Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee sat in the control room. After the first wave of earthbenders, no more soldiers came their way. Mai sighed from her chair, her voice carrying her usual boredom. \"This is boring.\" Ty Lee kept looking through the spyglass and said, \"The soldiers all left, they all climbed the wall. Maybe they gave up?\" Azula narrowed her eyes. \"They gave up too quickly. They might be planning something. Keep watching, Ty Lee, and let me know if you see anyone coming toward us.\" Ty Lee answered with a happy tone, \"Sure!\" The war minister spoke confidently. \"You have nothing to worry about, Princess. Those soldiers must have realized the futility of their attempt to stop our great drill.\" Azula didn't reply. She sat there doubtful. She didn't believe the Ba Sing Se defenders would just give up like that, not with their city's fate on the line. But despite her doubt, for the next few minutes as they approached the wall, nothing happened. It was not until they made contact with the wall and the drill began digging through it that rocks started falling upon them. Even then, the attacks were too pitiful. With each passing moment, the war minister grew more confident in their success. But when the drill was more than halfway through, the reports began coming in. The first mentioned the ambush of an engineer and the loss of the schematics. The next reported one of the giant metal support beams had been cut clean through. It was clear that it was an act of sabotage. The minister looked both shocked and horrified, while Azula stood up quickly. \"That's what they were planning. Ladies, with me.\" Both Ty Lee and Mai followed Azula outside of the control room. Ty Lee asked, \"Where do we start the search?\" \"The outer layer, of course,\" Azula replied sharply. \"The infiltrators are attacking the support beams to weaken the drill, maybe hoping the raining rocks will cause the body to fail under its own weight if the beams are damaged enough.\" Azula accelerated her pace, her eyes glinting with focus. \"We must hurry. We don't know how many individuals we are dealing with or the extent of the damage they have caused.\" Mai and Ty Lee picked up their speed as well, keeping close behind Azula. The trio quickly arrived at the outer layer of the drill and began moving from one location to another, searching for the intruders. Eventually, they heard voices coming from behind the beams ahead. Azula narrowed her eyes, then surged forward faster than before. She dashed down to the lower level and there, she saw them. The Avatar and his two Water Tribe friends were cutting into one of the beams. The Avatar and the water tribe girl were passing water back and forth, chipping slowly at the massive support. Without a word, Azula thrust her fist forward, launching a blazing fireball toward them. The Water Tribe boy, who had been cheering the girl and the Avatar on, suddenly screamed, \"Be careful!\" His warning gave the Avatar just enough time to dodge the attack. The three immediately turned and ran, while Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee charged after them. The Avatar team bolted into the inner layer of the drill, the narrow corridors echoing with their hurried footsteps. At the end of one corridor, the group split, Aang darted one way while the Water Tribe siblings fled in another. \"The Avatar is mine. You follow the other two,\" Azula ordered sharply as she kept running. The trio split, and the moment they did, Ty Lee glanced at Mai and said, \"I'll go catch them!\" Then she accelerated, her speed surging to a level far greater than before. Mai blinked, unable to even attempt to keep pace. There was no way she could catch up to that. [Tai Lung's training did wonders to Ty Lee] Mai thought as she continued at her own pace. Katara and Sokka stumbled into a pipe full of mud and rocks, Sokka pointing quickly. \"This must be water mixed with rocks from the wall!\" \"Then it must be leading outside,\" Katara said, her face lighting with hope. But before she could say anything more, Ty Lee appeared behind them like a shadow. Before either sibling could react, she unleashed a barrage of precise strikes. Both Katara and Sokka collapsed onto the floor, their bodies paralyzed. Ty Lee stood over them, hands on her hips, and said brightly, \"Your escape ends here.\" Seconds later, Mai arrived. Her usual monotone voice carried no excitement as she noted, \"You caught them. Yahoo.\" Ty Lee smiled wide. \"Of course! I won't let the ones who hurt you escape!!\" For once, Mai's expression softened, a small smile tugging at her lips. —————— The Avatar on his own was much faster, his airbending carrying him across the drill's surface with incredible speed. Even so, Azula pursued without hesitation, her cold determination driving her forward. When she finally burst onto the top of the drill, she spotted him in the distance near the city wall, his back turned as he worked something feverishly at the drill's outer shell. Azula's eyes narrowed. She charged. The Avatar's small pet screeched sharply, warning him of her approach. In the same instant, Azula unleashed a barrage of fire, punching forward again and again, blue flames streaking across the drill's surface. Aang spun and quickly bent the broken rocks scattered across the drill, raising a makeshift wall. Her flames smashed against the stone again and again, searing heat flaring but failing to break through. The Avatar retaliated at once, rocks rose in the air and hurtled toward her. Azula twisted and weaved, dodging some, kicking others aside, all while firing back with her relentless flames. Their duel came to an abrupt halt as the sky above them seemed to darken. Enormous chunks of rock rained down from the top of the wall, forcing both combatants to break off and dodge for their lives. The deadly falling rocks left no room for attacks, only dodging for survival. When the rain of rocks finally ended, the two faced each other once again. Both dropped into stance, ready for the second round, when suddenly the entire drill shuddered violently beneath their feet. The drill's outer shell expanded outward with brutal force, splitting the ancient wall. Ba Sing Se's outer wall cracked and then broke apart. The Avatar froze, staring wide-eyed through the new opening. He could see the sprawling city beyond. His voice dropped in dread \"Oh no…\" Azula's laughter rang sharp and triumphant. \"It's too late now, we have succeeded.\" But Aang's face hardened, determination igniting within him. He lunged back into the fight, this time attacking with every element at his disposal. Air whirled around him, water surged from the flask he carried, and stone leapt from the drill surface. The onslaught came swift and fierce, and for the first time, Azula began to falter beneath the Avatar's storm. Yet the drill didn't stop. It pressed deeper, grinding through the city wall. By the time half its bulk had forced through, the massive machine came to a halt and then unleashed chaos. Its belly opened, and hundreds of Fire Nation soldiers poured out into Ba Sing Se, attacking civilians and soldiers alike. Through the enormous breach, the flanking tanks thundered in, joining the invasion. Aang's eyes widened. He turned away from Azula, desperate to protect the innocent people now under attack. Azula's gaze sharpened. She raised her hand, her fingers curling as sparks of blue danced at the tips of her fingers. The Avatar heard the crackle, and noticed the flash of blue behind him. He spun around just in time to see Azula release the bolt. It lanced toward him, aimed to kill. With a desperate twist, he dove aside, the lightning seared past him, missing by a hair's breadth. Azula clicked her tongue, annoyed by her failure, her golden eyes narrowing at her prey. The Avatar rose again, eyes locked on her, when a familiar voice called out from behind Azula. \"Azula!!\" Both turned. Mai and Ty Lee had arrived with a squad of Fire Nation soldiers. Bound between them, struggling helplessly, were Katara and Sokka. Aang's face collapsed into horror. Azula, however, smiled cruelly, satisfaction dripping from every word as she gestured to the captives. \"Look at what my friends brought with them. What a pleasant surprise, don't you think, Avatar?\" The Avatar clenched his fists and screamed \"Release them, your fight is with me!!\" Azula laughed \"No, this is a war not a duel. Surrender yourself or your dear friends die\" The water tribe girl, Katara, said \"Don't listen to them Aang!! Run and defend the city!!\" One of the soldiers holding Katara pulled her roughly and slapped her while saying \"Silence!!\" Katara screamed in pain while Sokka screamed \"Bastard!! Don't touch her\" Strong wind blasted, catching the attention of everyone, The Avatar's eyes and tattoo were glowing.\n\nAzula, Mai, and Ty Lee sat in the control room.

            "content": "Inside the drill, Tai Lung sat with his eyes closed, lost in meditation, ignoring the chaos and machinery rumbling around him. The silence he kept within himself lasted until the entire drill shook violently. His eyes snapped open, and slowly, he rose to his feet. \"It seems the drill penetrated the city wall,\" he muttered. He began moving, his steps calm and steady toward the control room. Halfway there, he stopped abruptly. His senses sharpened, his chest rising as he felt it, an overwhelming storm of chi raging outside the drill. His eyes narrowed. He remembered that chi; it was the same one the Avatar had released right before merging with the Ocean Spirit. Though it was stronger now, it still paled compared to the might of the Ocean spirit. Without wasting another breath, Tai Lung's pace shifted from stillness to a blur. He dashed forward with full speed, determined to see for himself what was happening outside. To save time, he let fire gather in his palms and unleashed bursts of flame against the drill's metal walls. Molten holes spread in his wake, letting him pass through barriers with ease. From start to finish, less than a minute passed before he emerged on the surface. The sight that greeted him was unexpected, the Avatar floated in the air, eyes and tattoos glowing, it had a sinister look to it. Behind him, the city of Ba Sing Se loomed. The entire section of the wall where the drill had been digging was obliterated, reduced to massive stone fragments now circling the Avatar like obedient titans. Ahead, enormous boulders lay atop the drill's shattered front, crushing it completely. From its front, mud poured out in thick streams, proof of the damage wrought by those massive rocks. Fire Nation soldiers scattered like ants, fleeing in terror. Tai Lung's eyes swept the chaos, and at the left side of the drill, he caught sight of the water tribe being carried away using earth bending by a short individual dressed in green toward the nearby building. The Avatar's gaze shifted then, his glowing eyes fixed on the right side of the drill, down on the ground. Tai Lung followed his line of focus and saw Ty Lee and the others running frantically, their forms splattered with mud as they struggled to escape. The Avatar raised his arms and then waved them forward. A dozen enormous rocks shot toward Ty Lee and the others like missiles of death. Without hesitation, Tai Lung's chi surged, lightning crackling around his body. He stabbed his fingers forward, unleashing a storm of lightning bolts that streaked across the air, colliding with the flying rocks and shattering them to dust before they could hit their target. Every eye turned toward him. The Avatar's glowing gaze locked on him. The citizens of the city, the Earth Kingdom soldiers, and even the Fire Nation troops halted to watch. All of them bore witness as Tai Lung stood firm. Tai Lung's eyes remained on Ty Lee and her group. His voice cut across the battlefield, loud and commanding. \"Retreat now.\" The words snapped them into motion. Ty Lee and the others ran as fast as their legs could carry them, though Ty Lee herself risked a final glance at him. She saw him standing tall, lightning still dancing across his arms as he faced the enraged Avatar. Mai's voice came quietly at her side. \"He will be fine. He's defeated the Avatar before.\" Ty Lee's lips pressed together, and she gave a small nod, saying nothing more as they disappeared into the city. —————— When Tai Lung tagged along, he didn't expect to meet the Avatar here. In truth, the thought of the boy hadn't even crossed his mind. Yet here he was, standing before the master of the four elements. But regardless of the circumstances, Tai Lung was never one to hesitate when faced with a challenger. He lowered into a stance, a smile curving across his lips as his eyes locked on the glowing figure. The Avatar responded with a sudden flurry of movements, arms sweeping and circling wildly. At first, Tai Lung felt nothing. Then the air shifted. Powerful winds surged, sweeping across the battlefield until it seemed a tornado had sprung to life all around them. Tai Lung moved without pause. Lightning crackled across his body before bursting forth in a bolt aimed directly at the Avatar. But a massive boulder intercepted the strike, splitting the light with a deafening crack. At the same time, the ground beneath the boy's feet trembled and split. Chunks of rock rose into the air, circling the Avatar until they formed a spinning barricade of earth, a storm of destruction spiraling around him. Narrowing his eyes, Tai Lung studied the Avatar's movements, the rhythm of the floating rocks. The longer he watched, the clearer the pattern became. The moment recognition struck, he acted. From his fist, he unleashed a surging wave of blue flames spilling outward like a raging sea, crashing toward the Avatar. The Avatar halted the spin of several boulders and slammed them together into a shield. The fire roared against the stone, the flame wave scattering across the storm. But Tai Lung didn't wait for the flames to fade. He ignited bursts from his feet and hands, launching himself through the air, his body arcing toward the nearest floating rock. He landed then leapt again, using short, explosive jets of fire to cover the distance. One rock to the next, climbing higher and faster, he kept his approach hidden behind the whirlwind of stone. By the time he reached the Avatar's side, the boy had shifted the rocks, searching for any sign of him. When the Avatar realized Tai Lung was nowhere to be seen, his glowing eyes darted left, then right. But it was already too late. Tai Lung lunged from behind, springing off a massive rock with perfect timing. The Avatar turned at the last instant, sensing the movement, but he was too slow. Tai Lung was already upon him, fists flashing in a relentless barrage. Each strike found its target accurately, hammering into pressure points and chi paths. The Avatar gasped, his power collapsing inward as the flow of energy was cut. His body stiffened, paralyzed. In an instant, the light faded from his eyes and tattoos. The Avatar State vanished, and he began to plummet helplessly toward the ground. Tai Lung hovered above only for a moment, then descended after him. He caught the boy by the neck before he could hit the earth. Tai Lung landed heavily, his boots slamming into the dirt with a thud, before tossing the Avatar aside like discarded weight. The boy scrambled weakly to look up at him, fear etched across his features. From beginning to end, the battle had lasted mere seconds, and yet the Avatar, in his most powerful state, had been crushed. Tai Lung's gaze bore down on him. His voice was calm, almost curious. \"Did you master water and earth?\" Aang said nothing, only staring, wide-eyed and shaking. Tai Lung's expression hardened, his tone lowering. \"I don't like to repeat myself.\" Aang swallowed hard, his throat dry. \"I mastered water… and I am learning earth bending now.\" \"Not bad, that's faster than I expected\" Tai Lung nodded with slight approval before his eyes narrowing dangerously \"Ty Lee, the girl with scarred face, is my fiancee, and Mai, the gloomy girl with hidden weapons, is my friend. If I see or hear you are trying to hurt them again, I will rip your limbs, roast them, and then feed them to you\" Aang paled with terror. Tai Lung, satisfied by the reaction he got, said nothing further. He simply turned, his steps slow and deliberate, and began walking away from the shattered wall of Ba Sing Se, after making a few meters distance with the Avatar, Tai Lung took flight heading back toward his people in the distance. Despite his lone and unhurried figure, no one moved to stop him. None dared. They had just witnessed the Avatar unleash his fury, nearly tearing the battlefield apart… only for one man to appear and defeat him with ease, in seconds. Not long after his retreat, Toph rushed toward Aang and spoke urgently. \"Twinkle Toes! Are you okay?\" Aang replied weakly, \"Tai Lung did something to me… I can't move my body at all.\" \"That's the same thing the strange girl did to Katara and Sokka,\" Toph said. Remembering his friends, Aang asked, \"How are they? Are they okay?\" \"They're fine. But just like you, they can't move,\" Toph answered. She tried to sound like her usual self, but deep down, she was scared. She might not have been able to see what had happened, but she had felt the earth shaking, massive chunks of wall and ground breaking apart, flying into the air without returning. The scale of earthbending was beyond anything she had ever imagined, and she knew only Aang in the Avatar State could achieve something like that. Yet Aang had been defeated in seconds by a single person. From what she sensed, the enemy had been completely at ease at the end, his heartbeat and breathing were completely normal. Tai Lung was indeed a monster just like the others' story made him to be.\n\nInside the drill, Tai Lung sat with his eyes closed, lost in meditation, ignoring the chaos and machinery rumbling around him. The silence he kept within himself lasted until the entire drill shook violently. His eyes snapped open, and slowly, he rose to his feet.\n\nInside the drill, Tai Lung sat with his eyes closed, lost in meditation, ignoring the chaos and machinery rumbling around him.

He remembered that chi; it was the same one the Avatar had released right before merging with the Ocean Spirit.\n\nThough it was stronger now, it still paled compared to the might of the Ocean spirit. Without wasting another breath, Tai Lung's pace shifted from stillness to a blur. He dashed forward with full speed, determined to see for himself what was happening outside. To save time, he let fire gather in his palms and unleashed bursts of flame against the drill's metal walls. Molten holes spread in his wake, letting him pass through barriers with ease.\n\nThough it was stronger now, it still paled compared to the might of the Ocean spirit.

The sight that greeted him was unexpected, the Avatar floated in the air, eyes and tattoos glowing, it had a sinister look to it. Behind him, the city of Ba Sing Se loomed. The entire section of the wall where the drill had been digging was obliterated, reduced to massive stone fragments now circling the Avatar like obedient titans.\n\nFrom start to finish, less than a minute passed before he emerged on the surface.

From its front, mud poured out in thick streams, proof of the damage wrought by those massive rocks. Fire Nation soldiers scattered like ants, fleeing in terror. Tai Lung's eyes swept the chaos, and at the left side of the drill, he caught sight of the water tribe being carried away using earth bending by a short individual dressed in green toward the nearby building.\n\nAhead, enormous boulders lay atop the drill's shattered front, crushing it completely.

A dozen enormous rocks shot toward Ty Lee and the others like missiles of death. Without hesitation, Tai Lung's chi surged, lightning crackling around his body. He stabbed his fingers forward, unleashing a storm of lightning bolts that streaked across the air, colliding with the flying rocks and shattering them to dust before they could hit their target.\n\nThe Avatar raised his arms and then waved them forward.

In truth, the thought of the boy hadn't even crossed his mind. Yet here he was, standing before the master of the four elements. But regardless of the circumstances, Tai Lung was never one to hesitate when faced with a challenger.\n\nWhen Tai Lung tagged along, he didn't expect to meet the Avatar here.

Lightning crackled across his body before bursting forth in a bolt aimed directly at the Avatar. But a massive boulder intercepted the strike, splitting the light with a deafening crack. At the same time, the ground beneath the boy's feet trembled and split. Chunks of rock rose into the air, circling the Avatar until they formed a spinning barricade of earth, a storm of destruction spiraling around him.\n\nTai Lung moved without pause.

            "content": "It didn't take long for Tai Lung to catch up with the retreating army. His battle with the Avatar had ended too quickly for Ty Lee and the others to gain much distance. Once reaching them, he descended directly in front of them, blocking their path. Everyone froze in place for a moment, until Ty Lee broke into a run and leapt into his arms, hugging him tightly. \"Tai! You're okay!\" Tai Lung smiled faintly. \"Now you're insulting me. Did you really think the under trained Avatar could defeat me?\" Ty Lee blinked at him, then shook her head quickly. \"Of course not! It's just… the Avatar was so scary back there.\" Tai continued to smile as he said. \"Actually, he was much stronger at the North Pole, thanks to the Ocean Spirit.\" Azula had heard enough. She cut straight to the point and asked the important questions. \"What is the state of the Avatar? Did you kill him?\" \"I only paralyzed him,\" Tai Lung answered casually. Azula's brow furrowed, but before she could object, the war minister, panting from the retreat, spoke up. \"Captain Lung, how could you leave the enemy of the Fire Nation like that?\" Tai Lung turned his gaze on him. \"If you don't like how I do things, feel free to go back there yourself. Capture him. Kill him. I won't stop you or interfere in your business\" The minister's fists clenched in frustration. \"You are our nation's most powerful bender. It is your duty to aid the Fire Nation!\" Tai Lung's eyes narrowed, his tone sharpened. \"I ensure that our people are not slaughtered because of the incompetence of the fools at the helm.\" The minister froze, paling as Tai Lung continued. \"You stand here breathing only because I came to your aid. Instead of annoying me, you should begin to think of a way to appease your dear Fire Lord. He won't care for excuses about failure, regardless of circumstance.\" The minister said nothing, his face drained of color. Azula broke the tense silence. \"While I'm sure no one will dare pursue us, I think we should retreat and regroup. The rest can wait.\" She didn't like the way Tai Lung spoke when mentioning her father or the way he carried himself, but she couldn't deny the truth. They weren't dead or being hunted down only because he had been there. —————— Under Azula's command, the defeated soldiers withdrew to the rocky hills opposite Ba Sing Se. There they made camp to rest and observe Ba Sing Se. From their vantage point, spyglasses revealed the tireless effort of the Earth Kingdom defenders: rows of earthbenders working hard to rebuild the broken wall even in darkness, stone after stone rising under the glow of torchlight. Azula's gaze lingered on them. Part of her felt a strange pang of pity. They should have been inside that city now, savoring victory, if not for the Avatar's sudden entry into the Avatar State. Her thoughts soured as she recalled Tai Lung's refusal to fight for conquest. The Earth Kingdom had the Avatar, the mighty master of the four elements. And the Fire Nation had their own monster, one who could easily tear down Ba Sing Se by himself, and yet he chose to abstain. Her golden eyes shifted to where he sat, cross-legged by the fire. Tai Lung was silent, his eyes closed in meditation, while Ty Lee and Mai spoke quietly nearby. With an irritated sigh, Azula strode toward them and called out, \"Tai Lung, for someone obsessed with training, it's strange you've been meditating so much lately. First in the drill, and now here.\" Without opening his eyes, Tai Lung answered, his voice steady. \"Meditation is also a form of training. And recently, I've been pondering something I cannot find an answer to.\" That caught their attention. Ty Lee leaned forward with interest. \"What is it?\" Tai Lung opened his eyes. \"The Avatar. He reincarnates endlessly and can master all four elements. The rest of us are limited to one from birth. Some\" his gaze moved to Ty Lee \"cannot bend at all. But why is that?\" The three girls were taken aback. Tai Lung pressed on. \"How does the Avatar do it? He's human, like us, but something sets him apart. The first Avatar must have done something no one else has. And when he enters that so-called Avatar State, his chi grows exponentially, surging as though he becomes someone else entirely.\" His focus settled on Ty Lee. \"I've been pondering this since the North Pole. If I can discover what the first reincarnation achieved, I might be able to replicate it. At the very least, perhaps I could bend a second element. Or unlock bending for those who have none, like you Ty Lee.\" Silence followed. The three of them stared at him as though he had grown another head. At last, Ty Lee's face lit up. \"That would be amazing! You'd be like… a second Avatar!\" Azula's thoughts, however, took a darker turn. [What would the world become if the Fire Nation could create Avatars at will?] Mai's monotone broke the quiet. \"I don't think you should be thinking like that. No offense, but you're already terrifying, some don't think you are a human. The idea of you in some kind of Avatar State? I'd rather not imagine it.\" Tai Lung chuckled lightly. \"It's been months, and I'm no closer to the answer. Still, I suspect it has something to do with the spirits, like the Moon and Ocean spirits. Perhaps beings like them shape the world as we know it.\" What he did not share aloud was the rest of his thoughts. He wondered if there was a way into the Spirit World, and how it might differ from the Spirit Realm he had known in his past life. Was there a connection between the two? The question burned quietly within him, he wanted answers. —————— The next morning, Azula gave the order to the soldiers for a full retreat. But within her sharp mind there lingered an image that refused to fade, the Avatar, in his fury, unleashed his true power of legends. It was the first time she had seen the true might of the Avatar State, and now she fully understood why the Fire Nation considered the Avatar their greatest enemy. When he entered that state, he was no longer just a bender, he became a force of nature, unstoppable, untouchable. And for now, there was no one who could stop him… no one except Tai Lung. In Azula's eyes, the only viable path forward was to strike quickly, to eliminate the Avatar while he was in his normal state. But there lay the problem, none of them understood exactly how the Avatar State worked. What triggered it? How long could he sustain it? And with the boy hidden away inside Ba Sing Se, there would be no chance to corner him in a vulnerable moment. That same thought led her to another bitter truth: as long as the Avatar remained inside the city, they could not hope to invade it. The risk was too great, another outbreak of the Avatar State would mean disaster, a swift and costly defeat. And yet, ironically, the Earth Kingdom faced the same dilemma. Azula knew they would never dare to attack her camp. Not with Tai Lung sitting among her ranks. They understood as well as she did that any move against them might provoke him, not only their soldiers will be at risk but it could cause Tai Lung to turn his fury on Ba Sing Se, the city could fall if he leads the attack. For the first time, Azula saw the war in a different light. Both sides had their pride and power, both brimming with soldiers and resources, yet both were paralyzed. The war was not dictated by armies or strategy but by the existence of two individuals. An Avatar on one side. A monster in human skin on the other. Everything else had become irrelevant. Even as their forces marched away, the thought gnawed at her. How could they truly defeat the Avatar? How could they win this war? No matter how many scenarios she conjured in her mind, no matter how many clever strategies she tried to weave, the conclusion was always the same. The moment the Avatar entered the Avatar State… it was their loss. She remembered some reports mentioning how the resistance declined after the return of the Avatar. Part of her thought it was ridiculous if the so-called resistance stopped in hope the Avatar will defeat the Fire Nation. Now, it all made sense to her. Azula's gaze shifted to Tai Lung, Ty Lee, and Mai. The trio were conversing amongst themselves, though Ty Lee was doing most of the talking. Azula's mind drifted back to the days when they had all trained together at Tai Lung's home. She had stopped going there to train under her father instead. A choice that, in retrospect, had been a mistake. Had she continued to try mimicking Tai Lung, perhaps she could have defeated the Avatar as he had, or at least possessed the strength to put up a real fight instead of suffering a disgraceful retreat.\n\nIt didn't take long for Tai Lung to catch up with the retreating army. His battle with the Avatar had ended too quickly for Ty Lee and the others to gain much distance. Once reaching them, he descended directly in front of them, blocking their path.\n\nIt didn't take long for Tai Lung to catch up with the retreating army.

Did you really think the under trained Avatar could defeat me?\"\n\nTai Lung smiled faintly. \"Now you're insulting me. Did you really think the under trained Avatar could defeat me?\"\n\nTy Lee blinked at him, then shook her head quickly. \"Of course not! It's just… the Avatar was so scary back there.\"\n\nTy Lee blinked at him, then shook her head quickly. \"Of course not! It's just… the Avatar was so scary back there.\"\n\nTy Lee blinked at him, then shook her head quickly. \"Of course not!

She cut straight to the point and asked the important questions. \"What is the state of the Avatar? Did you kill him?\"\n\nAzula had heard enough.
