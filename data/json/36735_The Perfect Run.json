    "description": "The Perfect Run is now available on Amazon and Audible: Volume 1 (Audiobook), Volume 2 (Audiobook), Volume 3\n\nRyan \"Quicksave\" Romano is an eccentric adventurer with a strange power: he can create a save-point in time and redo his life whenever he dies. Arriving in New Rome, the glitzy capital of sin of a rebuilding Europe, he finds the city torn between mega-corporations, sponsored heroes, superpowered criminals, and true monsters. It's a time of chaos, where potions can grant the power to rule the world and dangers lurk everywhere.\n\nRyan only sees different routes; and from Hero to Villain, he has to try them all. Only then will he achieve his perfect ending... no matter how many loops it takes.\n\nThe Perfect Run updates on Tuesday and Saturday. Cover by Vitaly S. Alexius.",

It avoids the common pitfalls that a lot of time travel novels can fall into by never once making me feel like there was no tension or stakes. If you are on the fence about whether the book is for you or not I recommend giving it a read it immediately!\n\n Report",
