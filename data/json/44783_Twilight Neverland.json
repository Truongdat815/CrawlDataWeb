If you want something that makes you laugh, cheer, and make you cry? Then this is the story for you.\n\nIt is an incredibly slow burning work, as the narrative is still on its prelude arc. However, I assure, that this story is entirely worth reading. If you are a writer and struggle with mental illness, then this story will most definitely pull on your heart, because you know what? It totally did that with mine.\n\nStyle\n\nFor starters, this story makes an incredible usage of illusion in order to paint a picture of someone in crisis. The Hanged Man, in all honesty, his very name rings very personal bells to me. I'm going to be honest and just say that I am all too familiar with how Zachary feels in life. Regardless, the style mixes a vibrant vocabulary and toys with words in order to paint a crystal clear image of what is going on.\n\nGrammar\n\nI have zero reasons to complain here. Move along.\n\nCharacters\n\nI am going to start by remarking on Lauren, an enigmatic, almost guardian angel figure for Zachary. Truth be told, I love her! She is understanding, kind, and patient, trying her best to be there for her mentally ill friend. Lauren is that friend we loners wish we had in real life, she is that friend! I love how she never gives up, never gives in on the dream, and keeps trying to motivate Zachary even though she got an award instead of him.\n\nI love how she cares!\n\nZachary himself, is an incredibly real teen in a horrible situation: dysfunctional family, feeling empty, loneliness, and only having art to escape. You will smile when he gets a second wind, and you will cry when he gets smacked down, and then you will smile again when he gets a chance to rebound. \n\nHis relationship with Lauren, and he just softens up around her, is significantly touching. It is a slow burn, and yes there does exist conflict between them that revolves about what he thinks of her and his own personal life. Yet, you just want them to stick together, to carry each other to the other side of the road, and to achieve their dreams of being famous writers like their idol.\n\nTo conclude, Twilight Neverland is an emotional rollercoaster of a story, bringing in fantasy elements along with a heart-rending narrative beside a beautiful style. In conclusion, if you want a story that makes you cry, this is the one.\n\n Report",

This one is really reader driven - I can see them really growing into their craft.\n\nTwilight Wonderland is a wonderfully written piece of fiction. The words ooze with mystery and disenchantment to the point of being oppressive if not in the right state of mind to obsorb the ideas. Would probably best serve the sort of reader who is already massively dissillusioned or who feel ostricized (wether by choice or not). A reader who has a positive pre-disposition just won't 'get' the world that's being built.\n\nI gave this work 4 stars because it is a very well written piece of fiction, but it should not be read in one sitting.\n\nOnto the good stuff:\n\nGrammar: Top marks. There's a few odd word choices that sort of feel out of place, but otherwise the flow of the prose feels smooth to read.\n\nStyle: As mentioned, the atmosphere and tone are incredibly dark and oppressive. Only someone who can weave atmosphere into their work, giving the world a life of their own at a near visceral level has a firm grasp on their voice as an author. \n\nNow for the trouble spots:\n\nStory: The first four parts read like disjointed short stories. They have a unified theme, which gets to feel on the verge of preachy after the sheer amount of repition. So it's four false starts, followed by another false start through the sequence of preludes. All of these before the story parts makes me wonder if maybe the author chose to start their story in the wrong place or perhaps they should be telling a different story all together. \n\nCharacter: There are a few different characters that we're introduced to, but because it's all prologues and preludes, I'm not to sure if I was meant to care or even remember these people. There's a general vagueness to each of the prologue characters. Beyond a brief physical description we don't really get to know their personalities. Donna's introduction starts with the same oppressive intro as the Dark Knights, and with the boy in seclusion - so it's difficult to weight each character on their own personalities. \n\nThen there's our epitomi of self-angst Zack, who actively avoids anything social and thinks poor of anyone who tries engaging with him, including his own mother. I'd ask what went on there, but he holds the same black brush against all people, so it's not even worth asking the question. At first I thought the author was doing something clever with deftness, but no... the guy is just an elitist ass and views anything coming out of the pesant's mouths as gibberish. He made a good impression, can't you tell?\n\nZack is only relatable if you share the same loathing of your fellow man.\n\nI gave the character section 2 stars because while I don't understand the purpose of the prologue characters, at least Zack made me feel something, even if it's the feeling that he's not worth getting to know and a general waste of my time (same words he uses to describe the people he has to tolerate on a day to day basis).\n\n Report",

That's the best way to describe it. I don't know if it's fantasy, mystery, psychological horror, or something else. I have never seen anything like that on the site. It has its strengths, but those same strengths can ultimately reduce it for some.\n\n \n\nThe good:\n\n1. The story is nothing special. The settings are pretty average and our mc is a depressed high school student. However, this is not the usual type of depression found in other novels on this site. The author takes it and digs deeper into the lowest of the lowest. But to balance it, there is a heroine (because of course there is a heroine) and she is the one who makes the story shine.\n\n2. Whether it's just fantasy or psychological, I really like the concept of mc noise. By refusing to listen to others and (literally) shutting them out, the mc has already strengthened his already horrendous attitude. Don't get me wrong, he scratches some points for being right as a character, but as a person he's pretty bad. So, for clarity, mc is a sad part of sh * t (for some reason, it can't be explained exactly for spoiler reasons).\n\n3. There is another thing that I feel might be a spoiler because the story continues to shroud itself in this mystery so I'll just lay it out with a tag.\n\nSpoiler \n\n \n\n \n\nThe bad:\n\n1. The story introduction for the story is strange to say the least. It pulls you through 4 false intros before you end up in the prelude. Some may find this interesting, but it only disconnects me and loses me. This is what this novel does well. I was very lost.\n\n2. The characters are great and carry a bit of a story, but the story itself feels weird and undirected. It hits big scenarios one after another, I think it's a mystery, but I still don't know what it's for, and I feel it's a bit pointless and sometimes borning, which is what ultimately brings down the story for me (the only reason I haven't ditched yet is the characters and their actions).\n\n3. The quality of writing is a bit heavy, and it gets really heavy when you reach the dark areas of the story, but if you can get over it, it's not all unbearable or unreadable. There are some small mistakes, such as grammar and other small mistakes, but you won't really notice them. There is some small mistakes such as grammar and other small things, but you won't really notice.\n\n \n\nIt was an overall ok novel from what I read so if you want to pass the time with some depression then this is the novel for you. I just hope the author fixes the issues and stick to a clear direction.\n\n Report",

Most are all done in one day and therefore you are greatly reducing your exposure to new people. One chapter a day would mean you are on the new updates section each day instead of like once a week as you are currently. \n\nSecondly, I loved the picture in the first chapter, it looked really good. Nice way to start off.\n\nGrammar\n\nA few mistakes here and there e.g.'it hasn't been a few minutes since she started writing. 'Cladded in armour'. But these are all quite small and easily missed by authors who are very familiar with their work. A quick run-through of Grammarly or word to speech would likely catch them all. I should probably also follow my own advice here aswell lol.\n\nStyle\nThe style is quite poetic at the start which is different but quite nice to read.  Something I've never really read before. It's unique but might make your story more of a niche than it already is. It is a mix of past and presents tense but still written well enough to be more than readable.\n\nSome phrases could do with a little tweaking as they seem to interrupt the flow of the story. 'dozed off in his own daydream of thought,\n he woke up when he realized Lauren was no longer by his side,. Just a few bits and bobs here and there to help the flow.\n\nThe first chapter heavily favoured tell but it does balance out with a nice mix of dialogue and description later on.\n\nStory\nIt starts off all fantasy-like, with swordsmen and knights. A raging battle etc. Then the next moment it becomes a modern-day school setting,\n.It was like I was reading a different novel entirely in its style. Especially since the characters had names here. There are a lot of puzzling questions- was the first part his dream or some giant metaphor. It is definitely through-provoking\nand I am definitely curious to see how it will all link in together.\n\nCharacter\nWe don't really get any character names until later on. It sort of reminded me of the goblin slayer novel in that aspect. The lack of names does make it somewhat harder to feel a connection to the characters. As does the style. However, as I read more and learnt more about them, I still did find myself enjoying the characters.\n\n Report",

The night retained its sombreness among Fall’s gentle breeze. Not a soul wandered the streets, leaving it for the creatures of the night to settle freely.

Day in and day out, he would shelter himself within that cave, never to leave or walk outside. It was not so bad, he believed. As his curiosity peaked, so did the stakes for going outside, but nevertheless, he obeyed the words and stayed behind. For going outside was not his to decide. The world outside was dangerous and filled with lies, that was why he was told to stay aside. But time moved on and there was no one he could rely upon. He was left with nothing, believed in nothing, and acted for nothing. That was the life of the boy in the lone cave, a life bounded by realism.\n\nHowever, the world was far from dangerous. It was furnished with fields of roses for all kinds. It was there that the girl walked. With eyes shining bright like a crystal, she looked upon the world with sanguineness, neither giving it love or hate, but just a little hope instead. For she knew, even at that age, she knew… what cruelty this beautiful world harbored. Despite that, the girl walked, tripped, fell, got back up, and moved forward. Every hurdle at her path would eventually pave the road for her to become a woman she was proud of. She was ever so dreamful.\n\nIt was at a crossroads of dream and reality that the boy met the girl. He retreated to his own whilst she pressed forward to pull him out. And in that vague area of persistence were they both able to find familiarity with each other.\n\n\"What is your name?\" The girl asked the boy.\n\n\"I have no name,\" said the boy.\n\nWhat brought sorrow and emptiness to the boy put a smile on the girl's face for they were truly similar. She too lacked what he believed to have no desire for.\n\nA girl with no name.\n\nA boy with no name.\n\nThey found reason within.\n\nA title, a name, of glory and achievement, that was what it was. That was what it was, the missing archstone in their life. They both wanted it, not for the world, but for themselves.\n\nThis content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\n\nStraying far from the village and cave, the boy and the girl took each other's hands and walked a promising road of union, toward the future that was set for recreation by the arbiter from above — they were but mere lines on a white plate after all.\n\nBut the girl was always one step ahead, oblivious to the boy she dragged along, oblivious to the world's true state. For the boy was never able to pull her out of the dream. He was always late. But he still moved forward, he had to catch up to her eventually, that was the curse she deemed upon him.\n\nDespite all odds, they walked together to face a great force—calamity. One that could erase all life on the planet. And that from which eradicated life cannot return nor bear it back. In the end, it stood still on the desert that once called itself the ocean, waiting for the impact.\n\nThe journey would start again.\n\nThey walked a lonely desert together, only gazing once or twice a day upon the moon; the moon that granted wishes.\n\n'A wish for faint light. A wish for greater blight.' They were told by a wanderer. 'The moon grants all.'\n\n'How did you know?' They would ask.\n\nFrom the scribe in the tower. The wanderer would answer.\n\nIn the center of that solemn desert, a tower of ancient magnitude sat in solace, isolated from the world, serving only as guidance to those who sought knowledge. Within it, a scribe of yore studied its existence, till he became one with it. He stood as its envoy, providing guidance and selection in its name.\n\n'See it and gape in awe.' He said. 'How beautiful is it all?'\n\nThe boy and the girl were wonderstruck.\n\n'But with such reward, comes commandments,' said the scribe, 'First, cross the barren land of souls. Second, confer the nexus. Third, descend the sleeping ocean into the next heavenly body. And finally, reach for that night star.'\n\nAnd in came the crack down the middle.\n\nThe girl longed for change, for this world-bending event to be upon them, like a flower waiting for the seasons to change to blossom.\n\nBut the boy did not strive for such ambition, not because of fear, nor difference in mindset from back then. He had opened his mind long ago. He had learned what he considered the unimaginable, yet he knew that knowledge was beyond his limits, be it as a mortal or not. He simply desired the world be let go, to remain as it was, in a time of prosperity.\n\nThe two were at odds with one another, each with their own desire.\n\nOne for greed. One for diligence.\n\nYet both were for freedom.\n\nAfter all, they were the boy and the girl with no names.\n\nAnd so—\n\nLet's start on chapter one.",

            "content": "ARC 0: DO YOU DREAM OF AN ELUSIVE AGE?\n\nauthor /ˈɔːθə/\n\nthe writer of a book, article, play, etc.\n\n「A world without words...」\n\nWords. They are an art. Art to be mastered and perfected in all its techniques — not skills to be belittled in a world of great medium. A single word from a scroll could usher in a limitless amount of knowledge, for knowledge knows no bounds.\n\nEnter writing, the host of fantasy and fascination, the very origin of art. It is the core of communication.\n\nFrom both of these, the spoken and written languages were born. One could not speak without words. They could not invoke meaning without symbols. Everything in anything has language, it has its own words and structure. And from these languages, pen and paper came into existence, a new purpose for new dreamers. To create a feeling with mere words out of one’s mouth is easy, but to create it on paper and succeed, that is a true skill. If one’s heart is dedicated, then it is enough to convey emotions through the words in writing, to trigger a response in them. It has been proven to be true many times by successful authors.\n\nHowever, it hasn’t been all one-sided toward that bright-colored world.\n\nStrip one of purpose, give them a hollow reason and they’ll spend their entire life bickering over a dead horse in conflict.\n\nThey cling onto the malicious disease: Imagination.\n\nIn this world, communication and information brought conflict, which has always been the crux of everything that moved. It plagued the difference between doing things right and doing the right thing. Humans would always argue that the right thing reigned above all without question. Yet, they never asked for what is right, they never tried to take in a moment of solace, to imagine and think for themselves what is right and what is wrong.\n\nTo do the right thing is to be virtuous and compassionate but it is also to be inhumane. It is the thin facade humanity wears to hide its true desire. For if there is peace, there are talks of a bright future. But if there is an opportunity for glory behind cowardice, that facade is ripped apart by the uncontrollable grin of chaos.\n\nThat is the true nature of humanity.\n\nEven so, for a world without words to exist, it would be a dull one. There would be no noise covering up everyone’s ears from the constant chatter of hundreds in one place. There would be no man reading the newspaper and contemplating what the world has come to without understanding its words. There would be no people arguing over their differences and displaying their individual perspectives of their lives. There would be no girl talking to her mother with delight about their next trip, sharing their feelings to one another.\n\nThere would be no color. There would be no emotion. No order.\n\n“But…”\n\n「But what?」\n\nThe woman with the white hair wondered.\n\nIt hadn’t been a few minutes from when she started to write in her little notebook before she was brought at another hurdle. Years of experience still could not erase the blockage that every author had to encounter, time and time again. However, she did not seem to mind. After all, she was merely just projecting her thoughts on that paper out of boredom. They were quite hefty words, but to someone like her, they were nothing but rubbish notes.\n\nThere was no way she could truly focus on writing in a boisterous place like this, filled with bright lights and loud noise, be it from nearby chatter or voices coming from speakers.\n\nAround her were crowds moving left and right. Every single individual was in a mind of their own, worried about which path to take and where to find their flight. No matter how many times one has been to an airport, the rush to take action and the fear of being late would riddle one’s mind like they’re deciphering their first words as a toddler.\n\nTo the woman, who happened to wait for her flight as well, the airport was a great place to spend time in. If it wasn’t for the several international stores, the pristine restaurants, or the luxurious areas a high quality airport would provide, it was definitely for the human environment such a place had — especially for a woman who held words on a pedestal for a career. The chance to meet different kinds of people from different backgrounds, ethnicities and cultures, and languages; the chance to learn something really valuable without needing to travel to the ends of the Earth, this was something the woman needed very much.\n\n“But…,” the woman closed her notebook and stood up from her seat, “There’s a time for each and everything. I better get moving.”\n\nCollecting her small luggage, she moved a bit further, but she waited for her chance to join the crowds. Before taking another step, she felt the tip of her jacket being pulled downwards. Looking down, there was a little girl holding onto her jacket and eyeing her with the most innocent look on her face.\n\n“Excuse me, miss,” she called.\n\n“Well, hello there,” the woman smiled and crouched down to get on the little girl’s level, “Are you lost?”\n\nThe girl did not look scared or in any sort of distress of that matter. But that didn’t stop the woman from asking that question, she had no idea how to approach a lonesome child otherwise.\n\n“Um…” the girl looked at her with a fierce but child-like expression, “You dropped this.” She raised her hand towards the woman’s face, only to show that there was a pen held in her palm.\n\nIt was the woman’s pen. Her trusted sword and instrument. It looked just like any other pen one could find in the market, but that didn’t degrade the value it held in the woman’s heart.\n\n“Oh?! Thank you so much,” she opened up her palm for the girl to drop the pen on. “I would have been in serious trouble without this. You’ve done an amazing job bringing it back to me. Thank you!”\n\nUnauthorized usage: this tale is on Amazon without the author's consent. Report any sightings.\n\nLittle praise like this was like music to the girl’s ears. Her face lit up with delight as she felt this sense of achievement.\n\n“Are you…,” the girl was yet to be done with this encounter, “Do you write storybooks?”\n\nThe woman felt flattery as the girl saw her for what she truly was. “Do you like reading storybooks?”\n\n“Mhm,” the girl nodded.\n\nShe reached for her bag before pulling out a small, but wide book to show it off to the woman. It was decorated nicely with fantastical elements here and there, perfecting the image of it being a children’s book. “Sleeping Beauty” was written front and center on the cover in a stylized fashion.\n\nThe old and undying tale had somehow made its way into the girl’s bag. But the woman doubted the girl understood anything from it that weren’t pictures and text bubbles.\n\n“Oooh, wow! That is a very beautiful book,” the woman carefully looked at the book with mundane eyes, as if reminiscing of a simpler time where she had the luxury to admire such books, “Do you like it?”\n\n“Yeah, of course. I’ve read it a hundred times.”\n\n“Wow! That’s quite the achievement.”\n\n“Mhm! All my friends are surprised I could read so much. They like it too, but they’re too lazy to read it.” The girl let go of her stiffness as she was glad to finally express her interest to others who understood it. “What about you, miss? Do you like it?”\n\nInstead of replying so easily to the girl, the woman remained silent for a few seconds that lasted too long. When it came to children’s stories, it was easy to formulate a positive opinion on them considering the target audience. Yet the woman, who had a certain unique perspective on things, thought otherwise.\n\n“I don’t know honestly,” the woman’s eyes moved to a corner, diverting her attention from the girl’s sight and into an abyss of thoughts. “It’s good for the most part but… I guess I don’t like the ending that much.” Even talking to a child didn’t stop her from sugarcoating her words. She took such matters seriously to heart.\n\n“Whaaaat?” The girl looked at the woman with shock as if she heard heresy. She was a child but she was still old enough to comprehend an opinion and make one of her own. “But they defeated the witch at the end and the princess woke up. Isn’t that happy?”\n\n“Yeah, that’s the thing,” she paused for a moment, still looking at the corners of her eyes, “Maybe she shouldn’t have woken up.”\n\nHer face riddled with a bundle of different emotions, the girl did not quite understand what the woman’s words meant. And so the woman decided to diverge away from it by presenting a similar topic.\n\n“Oops! Looks like I spoke too soon.” The woman laughed, “What’s your name, little girl?”\n\n“Evie!” The girl smiled. It seemed that when it came to introductions, the girl pushed down the barriers with no problem. “What’s yours?”\n\n“Oh? Me? Well…” the woman looked down for a few seconds at the book she was reading before. She chuckled, “It’s Donna!” She extended her for a handshake and the girl surprisingly followed through.\n\nThe girl was well-educated in the terms of proper introductions. “Nice to meet you, Miss Donna!”\n\n“Just Donna,” The woman smiled. “Now… Evie! Have you ever wondered why babies sleep too much?”\n\nOut of everything that came out of that woman’s mouth. The girl was starting to catch on to the oddity of the conversation, she wasn’t young enough to ignore bizarre signs when she was given ones. Nevertheless, the girl went along with it.\n\n“Um… because they’re tired? She had no idea how to answer.\n\n“Babies naturally sleep after they eat or when they are with their mothers. They sleep to help themselves grow healthier.” The woman said, “I believe it has to do with dreams. Dreams come from imagination and desires. Did you ever dream of yourself as the sleeping beauty?”\n\nThe girl nodded. Yet the woman could tell she understood none of it from her lost eyes.\n\n“You know… let me tell you a story of mine,” she started, “There was once a boy sleeping on a tilted hill. Always sleeping in tranquility, he was never to be bothered nor woken up. And then a maiden in white approached. Promising life and prosperity, she embraced the boy. Eyes opened and conscious, he became. Even as he preferred his sleep, he did not weep. The maiden would ask why, for she, herself, could not wake the boy before. She would always approach him as a means to join his lovely dream. Imagination was everything she dreamed for, and only in dreams did it exist. But the boy, up and ready, replied “Imagination is cruel. It should not exist in a beautiful world like this.” And so, the boy took the maiden’s hand and stood up, promising to fulfill her wonderland into reality.”\n\nInstead of being visibly confused or responding in any way, the little girl did nothing at all. She took the words from one ear and threw them out the other.\n\nHowever, she did not appear quite the same.\n\nHer bright expression diluted to that of a somber and mundane one. Her mind had long wavered away from reality and into dreams. It would only leave her eyes to shut down for the final touch. True to form, she felt her eyelids pushing down against her will, getting heavier and heavier with every resistance she tried to hold back with. And at last, came the final push, covering her eyes with darkness.\n\nAs she lost balance over her body, the woman rested her hand behind her to prevent her from falling. The girl had fully succumbed to slumber.\n\nThe woman could not help but give off a warm smile to the girl.\n\n“The eye sees many things, yet can never truly see itself. The finger touches many things, yet can never truly touch itself. The mind thinks many things, yet can never truly think itself.” She let go of her things and helped the girl to a seat where she could rest properly. “Throughout reality and fiction, you alone can truly grasp the self.”\n\n“Eveline!” A woman’s voice called out from afar.\n\nThe woman with the white hair turned her head to see a woman running towards her in a rush. It would seem that it was most likely the girl’s mother or caretaker. The woman stood up leisurely to greet her. But the other woman was in another mind of her own, quickly skipped past introductions and formalities.\n\n“I am so sorry for the inconvenience! You know, kids these days. One second she was next to me, and the next she was gone.” The mother took a look at her daughter and did not seem fazed at all by the girl’s odd slumber in a place like this. She stood up and bowed with her torso down for the woman with the white hair. “Thank you so much for looking after her! I don’t know what could have happened if she suddenly dropped down in the middle of the crowds. How could I repay you?”\n\n“Oh, it’s nothing, really! I barely did anything but keep her company.” The woman with the white hair responded. “What matters is that you’re here now.” She looked at her watch. “Anyway, I better get moving to catch my flight. You take good care of her, she’s very special.”\n\n“I will!” The mother smiled, “And thank you so much again!”\n\nBut before the woman could get up and leave—\n\n“Wait…,” the girl cried. She opened her eyes but was slightly dazed, “M-Miss Donna,” it seemed as if she was going to drop in tears despite her drowsy behavior, “Why… why do you have to leave?”\n\n“Oh, dear!” The woman was taken by surprise.\n\n“Eveline!” The mother tried to discipline her daughter, “You don’t—”\n\n“It’s alright, it’s alright,” the woman placed her hand on the woman’s shoulder and gave her a smile before looking back at the girl, “Well, Eveline I… I have a duty to attend to, just like you do. You know what your duty is?”\n\nThe girl shook her head in denial.\n\n“To watch out for your mother here,” she pointed at the girl’s mother, “Because no one else will love you like your own mother. So don’t get out of her sight again.”\n\nThe mother was surprised by the woman’s kind words of advice. It was what she needed for her daughter to hear but never had the chance to say it herself.\n\nThe girl pouted, “But… where are you going?”\n\n“Oh, it’s a land full of amazing things everywhere, you’d love it,” said the woman, “Perhaps I can take you there one day.”\n\nThe woman got up to her feet and grabbed onto her luggage.\n\n“Wait,” the girl still had a question, “What is it?”\n\nThe woman smiled, “Wonderland!”\n\nAnd so the woman with the white hair departed.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 1 - For Whom the Bell Tolls\n\nmelancholy /ˈmɛlənkəli/\n\na feeling of pensive sadness, typically with no obvious cause.\n\nDon’t mourn the dead.\n\nDon’t mourn the living.\n\nMourn yourself.\n\nThe dead leave on a whim, and the living tire themselves with emotions to mourn them for unnecessary matters, but it is you who suffers more when all is said and done. Why must you suffer? If you rid yourself of these attachments called “emotions,” of “relationships,” then you would feel nothing but the somber note of surprise. No sorrow. No grief. No longer will regret be an obstacle you need to overcome.\n\nThat was what the young man gazing outside the window thought.\n\nHe was a senior student from “Everille Secondary School.” Not much of a talker or a patron of socializing. He would always position himself in the corner of the classroom, right by the window where he could disconnect himself from his surroundings.\n\nFour years have almost passed in this school, yet he was always by his lonesome. It wasn’t that those around him ignored or avoided him, in fact, they chose, more often than not, to befriend him. But he didn’t see that.\n\nHe did not want that.\n\nAnd it all tied back to his solemn ideology of reclusion.\n\nFrom his appearance, his blonde hair might have been unkempt, and his eyes might have carried bags for years, but it wasn’t brooding enough to reign hostility over the eyes of others. As for height, he was neither short nor tall, just average enough to not fetch any insecurity within.\n\nIt wasn’t the product of lack of sociability or any of that kind — he could very well hold a meaningful conversation if needed to.\n\n「But it’s all so tiresome.」\n\nThere was but one reason: his resentment for anguish, for suffering.\n\nIf he distanced himself from everyone, from useless attachments, then there would be no one to care about, no one to cry for when they hit the bucket. A life of isolation amounted better than a life of sorrow. There was no pain to carry, yet it was that very pain that held him back, that forced this twisted fate upon him.\n\nZachary Ashworth was a lone child, and the only heir to the Ashworth family, which dissipated entirely with the death of his father and his denial to take up the mantle. He had no one better to care about than his old man. He was his friend and mentor.\n\nSo when it all fell…\n\n…when the world turned black and the noise seeped in…\n\n…he was abandoned…\n\n…shattered…\n\n…alone.\n\nEven the comfort of his mother could not suffice. He chose not to grieve… because he could never feel proper emotion. His connection with his father was the only emotion that felt real to him, and now that it was beyond repair. There was nothing.\n\nYet the only thing that felt soothing to him was the rain.\n\nWatching the rain from the window was a blessing he always needed. Not from its serenity, but from the chaos it yielded. Rapid tears raining down on the world vigorously. To him, there was nothing about it that could not be named serenity in chaos. It was just like the monologue he once heard, the world moved, but the tears were ever so lost in the rain.\n\nThat reasoning aside, anything would be a good distraction from Mrs. Grace’s literature class. Zachary had a proper understanding and knew exactly what that class was about that afternoon. Because he, himself, was a devotee to literature with the aspiration of becoming an author one day, despite his little understanding of emotion itself.\n\nThe class was nothing special (it never was on any other occasion). It was just a discussion on an old novel, like usual, titled “The City of Thieves.” Quite the grandiose name, but it was a fable not out of the ordinary. A tale about two individuals from varying backgrounds thrown into the slammer alone in the midst of yet another great war. And in those trying times, they establish an alliance over their shared fate of solitary to embark on an unforgettable adventure.\n\nIn the mind of any youth in this era, this was a tale that carried only boredom. It would have caught Zachary’s attention had he not read that story over and over before this occasion.\n\nThe entire class, the students, were in another world of their own, yet Mrs. Grace carried on. She was not old enough to not notice the state of detachment the students were in, but she was young enough to choose to ignore it, which was, in itself, a barely condoned behavior from a teacher like her.\n\nA case of content theft: this narrative is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.\n\nBut then again, what could she ever do? Slam the chalkboard? It would stop them for a few minutes and the tedium ambience would take them over again.\n\nSome students were even lost in their own tales, the usual gossip. But they varied from simple rumors about fellow classmates to myths that haunt that very school. Everyone favored a bit of thrill, so there was always something of the kind.\n\nThere was once the matter of Mrs. Grace being in a relationship with one of the students in her class, a typical dramatic rumor to spice up the new year, as evident by that particular student earning high grades despite their failure multiple times prior to that rumor. It wasn’t that far-fetched in some aspects. She was quite the beauty for the eyes — no one would actually believe she was in her mid-thirties unless they were told. It was incredibly absurd and turned out to be a total fabrication of a troublemaker’s mind. But, like most rumors, it persisted in the mouths and ears of most students to this day.\n\nHowever, this absurd rumor was but the mere tip of the iceberg to all the rumors suddenly spiraling around, not just the school, but around town.\n\nFrom the rumor about a mother who was accused of murdering her own children, despite having no memory of it all, at the beginning of the year to the odd strings of suicide occurring throughout the entirety of the town. Some suspected it was serial killings disguised as suicide and that the watchmen were simply hiding that fact from the public.\n\nIn more mystical matters from the students’ gossip, there was once a fable that revolved around an old urban legend strictly named “Eight Feet Tall,” a woman who, like the name had suggested, was around eight feet tall, wearing a long stained white dress with a straw hat covering the top of her freakishly extensive dark hair. It was as if it was something out of Japanese horror legend, which it actually was. The creature, as described, would feed on the young children who caught onto the eerie sound — a repressed echo resembling the sound of banging on a solid surface — it would make before making an appearance. There was no specific location of where it lied, it would just roam the halls at night, or so it was told.\n\nThat being said, this was but a rare tale spread around to entice the history of this school, which was less than a hundred years old — still an urban legend first and foremost. This was a rural town, far from the reaches of the modern era, so it was natural such legends would remain even in this century.\n\nZachary did not care for all those tall tales. He had his own tale to think about in spite of it all. In front of him was a small notebook that harbored the tale of a dark knight’s journey of slaughtering the false champions of an elusive age. It was a short tale that he struggled to come to a conclusion with.\n\nBeing the aspiring author he was, he had so many things to write, so many things to think about, and yet, he could never formulate their words properly. There was always an obstacle in the way, hurdling a path that he, himself, feared to take.\n\n“Act zaxat draxaps eep craxapt bel tedaxaupp.”\n\nA voice could be heard at the end of the classroom. It was Mrs. Grace. Zachary could only hear nothing but muffled words that made no sense whatsoever. But from the manner of how she turned away from the desk and how the students were collecting their things to stand up and leave, it was the end of the class.\n\nSchool day was over.\n\nThe quiet gossip was long gone, and now loud muffled voices filled the classroom to the brim with the gibberish words that the simple mind could not comprehend.\n\nIt was how Zachary perceived the world around him.\n\nHe chose not to indulge within it, and so he shunned out every meaning to it. Even with the words making no sense, he could still distinguish the emotions behind a person’s words, a feeling he, himself, could never attain. The act of conversing in itself was quite tiresome for him. And so, he preserved his energy for what was necessary. Only speak to those worth talking to, and only hear those who are worth listening to, which were a select few that did not show improvement to his state.\n\nThe students started to leave. Zachary remained in his place. He wasn’t the only one as some would stay behind, but he stayed put for a very different reason.\n\nAs the door was open, he was able to see her.\n\nStanding right by the door just outside the classroom was a young woman dressed in the school’s attire like any other student.\n\nBut she stood out for all the wrong reasons.\n\nShe was someone who eagerly awaited Zachary at the end of every school day; a waste of energy. What she wanted and why it was from him, he had no idea. He never stuck around to listen to her. Her presence was a threat, which was why he tended to avoid her every time. But she was quick on learning his tactics and retaliated with persistence. At every chance he tried to push her away, she would always come back to him.\n\nHe did not know if it was always the same girl as the noise prevented him from seeing her clearly. The only feature he would remember is her long brown hair.\n\n“Just what the hell do you want from me?” He mumbled to himself after taking a deep breath.\n\nPacking the small bag that held his few notebooks, he rushed out of the classroom, before even the teacher could leave. There was no need to hear anything else from her because he wouldn’t, and he couldn’t stand the noise inside. It was always uncanny to him, one of the reasons why he was not in favor of crowds. And above all, he wanted to avoid the girl.\n\nEven with that timing, he could not escape her.\n\n“Ygemua!”\n\nShe called out, but she was only ‘noise’ to him.\n\nAnd so he did what he always did, he walked away.\n\nShe did not move. She did not call out. She lost him once again.\n\nEscaping the girl, Zachary found himself lost in the flood of students crowding the hallways. The path to the entrance was not going to be an easy one. Although most of them were heading there anyway, it was only a matter of time, a waste of precious time for him.\n\nThe town was small, the population was few, but it didn’t excuse the absurd amount of rush every individual was in. It might have been due to the curfew set for the evening but it has been the norm for years so everyone would be naturally prepared for it.\n\nNear the exit, there were more students gathered up to the side by the entrance to the girls’ bathroom. It seemed most of them stopped in front of what seemed like quite the commotion. Usually, these types of gatherings would happen if there was a fight going on.\n\nIt wasn’t like it mattered to Zachary anyway.\n\nHowever, as he passed by, he caught a glimpse of what was happening through the small gaps left by the crowd.\n\nDue to his ability to shut everyone out, he couldn’t comprehend what everyone was saying or mumbling between each other, but it seemed that some were in a state of panic.\n\nIt was there, in the middle of the vacant space left by the crowd, on the ground was a girl who seemed to have passed out.\n\n「All of this for that? I swear these people…」\n\nZachary did not care.\n\nThat girl probably skipped out on her meals and passed out. Such occasions would happen often in this school, so it wasn’t out of the ordinary, and certainly not something for him to bother with.\n\nIn spite of everything, he moved, just like the rain.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 2 - Aspiration for the Dull\n\nfool /fuːl/\n\na person who is duped or imposed on.\n\nAfter leaving the school, Zachary had no options but to head home — especially with the rain not letting up.\n\nIt seemed that it was a very uneventful day, just like any other day of the week. Perhaps he should skip the next day of school and enjoy some time on his own at home — which was something he did, but not quite often as he would not miss out on his academic year.\n\nAnd so, Zachary sat in front of his desk in his room, thinking about what should happen next on this monotonous night. He could simply go to sleep and close the chapter on that, but he longed for something to spark a light to this evening.\n\nHis room was surprisingly in a good state, not the type of room one would expect to see from someone usually cooped up in their room, which would still be the case if he was, in fact, a shut-in. After all, the maids of the house would make sure to check up on his room at least twice a day, which wasn’t much work considering he would tidy up on his own.\n\nIt was warm in the room that day. Be it from the heated lighting of the desk lamp, or perhaps it was the lack of any electronics within the room at that moment. The desk was perfectly placed near the window and close enough to catch the warmth of the fireplace in the middle of the room. Exactly what he needed for insight at a night like this, a mellow ambience.\n\nThis room naturally issued warmth and seemed almost archaic in its sense of architecture and furniture as well — yet that antiquity left the image of royalty within. That could be due to the fact that this was once a study room before he and his mother moved in. Zachary was not in his own home, after all — at least the place he had called home for the past year.\n\nEver since the passing of his father, he and his mother moved back to her family’s house where they could find the comfort of others. But the family, who was quite a lot in numbers, rarely stayed in the country.\n\nBoth he and his mother were left with his cousins and her mother, the butler, and some of the maids. Despite living in the same place, he rarely interacted with any of them, especially his cousins, who seemed to outright avoid him. And the chance itself for his mother to have a meeting with her sister was considered a marking.\n\nWith this barebone life, his mother tried to make the most of it. She was, just like him, not aiming for less or more, content with what she was given.\n\nZachary reached for the collection of blank papers neatly placed on his right and pulled three to his front, before putting a bunch of written pages on the side.\n\nThis was his preparation to start another chapter within the novel he was attempting to write. Unlike everyone in the modern-day world, he preferred to write things down with pen and paper, the traditional method, as it let out his ideas more easily and in a proper manner.\n\nIf he could not master the pen, then could he ever call himself a writer?\n\nDone with the first step, the second step presented itself… the waiting began. He stared at the blank page before him, waiting for the spark to ignite. The events were all planned out within his mind, yet he couldn’t let out a single word. This was a common obstacle for whenever he started a new chapter, something that would easily fade away after a few minutes.\n\nHis story was quite fantastical, in a sense. It tried to captivate the magic of fantasy while also presenting forth the horror of science. A blend of genres that might have occurred often in stories, but one that he wanted to tackle and test himself. A dystopian otherworldly timeline where imperialism stands as the victor to all. It might have been a plot that was done over a thousand times, but it was how they were written that made them unique and different in their own way. Not every genre or story tackled all subjects within it, and that left room for others to create.\n\nHe closed his eyes and tried to imagine the words forming in his head.\n\n\"...\"\n\nOne second later, his mind came to a halt.\n\n「No, that’s not it.」\n\nJust as he believed he was starting to indulge himself within his own world, he felt as though he returned back to the first step. He shook his head in an attempt to feel refreshed and restore back his confidence, but it was to no avail.\n\nAt this pace, the story would never come close to being finished by the end of the year.\n\n「If only fantasizing about it was enough to bring it to reality.」\n\nIt was then that he was hit with an epiphany.\n\nHis focus on writing resulted in a lack of reading. Perhaps if he read some more books, he could remember what it felt like to form comprehensive sentences and restore back the format of writing within his mind.\n\nIt worked before, it could work again.\n\nNear the collection of the neatly stacked papers were novels from various authors he admired and some that were left from the old study room. There were even a good amount of Japanese mangas on the side — a rarity to come by in this town.\n\nHe, like some in the modern world, had stumbled upon the world of anime and manga, a world often ridiculed by many who were not from Japan.\n\nThat was why he kept it to himself when it came to this specifically.\n\nPerhaps the world was a quarter into the 21st century where many things started to become generally accepted, but even he could not stand the judgmental eyes of those held back in the past who did not favor “difference”... and there were quite many.\n\nFrom stories about a guy with a crocodile face for a head to another guy for a chainsaw for a head, there was one specific manga that stood out in his eyes: “Ketsudansei.” It was a one-of-a-kind series around the true struggles of becoming a mangaka (a manga author). Oftentimes, Zachary would feel a connection between him and the protagonist. Writing a novel and drawing a manga were not so different after all, each had struggles of similar nature. But it was that same story that brought him pain, the pain of living in a reality that brought no time and no luck.\n\nTwo essential elements were able to move the protagonist of that manga forward: Time and Luck.\n\nThese were features he did not have and could not ever hope to acquire. One would say to work hard but even so, a man could work hard and exert all the unneeded effort he had on something that was never fit for him in the first place just because he thought it was his potential. There was no such thing as chasing dreams or building one’s own future.\n\nFrom the moment of birth, one’s own fate had already been written, a fate that could not be altered. If you were to be a teacher, then you would become a teacher, no changing that. Straying away just a little bit from that path resulted in misfortune.\n\nAnd it wasn’t all from Zachary’s own delusions that he came to this conclusion. It was the manga’s own author that taught him that. Even after its short success, the author could not find the bright-colored days he chased after for so long and decided that it was time, time for all the effort he wasted to mean something and took his own life. He wasn’t the first, however, many have taken their own lives because they sought out dreams that were never real.\n\nJust like Zachary’s own father.\n\nAll his idols suffered a great fate of misfortune. Everything came down without hesitation. The world he perceived was no longer of color or sound, it was all just noise, endless tiring noise. The more he rejected what he was presented with, the future that was given to him, the more the world tried to shut him out. If he did not obey its rules and heeded its commands then he would be no better than a blind idiot walking into the sun.\n\nHis idols were gone. His inspiration was hollow. His family disliked his ambition. His friends left him long ago for being different.\n\nThe world rejected his pleas.\n\n「So why?」\n\nHe held his grip against the desk and thought.\n\n「Why do I keep doing this?」\n\n\"Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Randall's Night Out Live!\n\nA voice emerged that broke his thought process and woke him from the dark state he was plunged into.\n\n\"...\"\n\n「Her…!」\n\nOn his desk was an old radio pulsating with life.\n\nIt was then that he remembered that he was awaiting a broadcast about a talk show. Normally, it would be broadcasted on television or the internet, but both of these things were far out of reach in this house. It was only by God’s will that Zachary was able to get a chance on listening to the show through the radio. He wasn’t a big fan of them but this was one he awaited with eagerness.\n\nEven after the thoughts he had, he brushed them away and moved forward. He could not strive for those colored days without a bit of positivity.\n\nGrabbing the radio closer to his ear, he could hear the round of applause accompanied by occasional whistles and cheers from devoted fans griddling the sound of the broadcast. It was clear how beloved and popular this show was. The host constantly thanked the audience for the gracious welcoming ovation as they all died down after half a minute — the hype was real.\n\nBut Zachary could care less about all that, he wanted to skip the introductions and get right into the meat of the topic. That was how desperate he was.\n\nThis story is posted elsewhere by the author. Help them out by reading the authentic version.\n\n“Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome with me the beloved author of the hit series “Serena’s Wonderland,” and the novel releasing this fall “Stage-Set,” Hye-mi Myung.”\n\nThe broadcast changed its music for this would be the part where they would show the guest sitting beside the host, with another round of applause going on in the background.\n\nHe listened with great interest as the host shut his mouth and the woman began to talk for herself, expressing her thoughts about her inspirations, the world she sought to create, and the hardships she went through.\n\nShe was quite the star among young adults. Her stories weren’t the type to appease young adults or teenagers (the teen romance with an ounce of fantasy that dominates that genre), yet they still managed to captivate a lot. That could be due to Myung, herself, being barely even thirty, so she understood what worked for her target audience as she was technically still part of them.\n\nIf all the world fell silent, Zachary would still listen to that woman.\n\nThat woman was just what he needed at a time like this, she was a true author of modern literature, the thing he had a knack for the most. She was just an average woman, nothing special about her at all, yet she had all that success. So even as Zachary’s mind urged him to pursue his dreams to become like her one day, it pushed him back with thoughts about waiting to hear of her death like every other person he admired in a couple of years or so.\n\nThat was just how his mind was: an epitome of opposing conflicts.\n\n“What do you think is your best work yet?” The host presented his question, “Or what novel are you most proud of?”\n\nZachary waited for an answer, like everyone else.\n\n“I think… probably “And Thus, They Struck.” It was definitely the most challenging one yet and one that I’m very proud of finishing.” She answered. “There was one specific chapter that I struggled with and that’s Chapter Fourteen, as you all might know if you’ve read the book. For some reason, I spent weeks stuck at that chapter, it was very frustrating to me — I almost scrapped the book altogether because of it and I’m glad I didn’t. But as it turns out, all I had to do was step away and let my imagination do all the work, because one day I woke up with the entire scene fresh in my mind from my dream. It was unbelievable. Dreams are the stem of all imagination… and that’s kinda what urged me to write “Stage-Set” after this book.”\n\n「Dreams, huh.」\n\nThe very thing he believed to not be true was supposed to be the key that could potentially pull him out of this misery. It was the key to throwing away the blockade that made his current goal unattainable. That was the solution he needed to come to terms with.\n\nAfter the broadcast was over, he put the radio aside, gripped onto his pencil with all his might, and carefully dusted off the paper on the desk to make sure it was perfectly clean.\n\nA white canvas for his art, for his world.\n\n「What am I even doing?」\n\nBut his world did not grasp the elucidations of the real world. It was more so a satire of much deeper themes and fantasies, at least he strived to make it so.\n\n“Shouldn’t this be the time the protagonist gains an epiphany?” He questioned himself, slightly stepping away from the desk, contemplating much thought and watching the raindrops blistering onto the window. “Ha… Who am I kidding? The world is not a piece of fiction I can simply fiddle with. Protagonist this, protagonist that… a role like that wouldn’t work for me.”\n\nIt wasn’t a mindset that every person was the protagonist of their own story and that he simply wasn’t. No, far from it. He had an entirely different belief. Simply put: he did not care. Reality did not have the need for something so trivial and meaningless. The world moved whether one was acknowledged or not.\n\nThere are no protagonists in this world. Only creators.\n\nAnd that was why he aimed to be one. An imagination so steep in the mind and imbued with vivid fantasies paved a great path for a creator. He wanted to follow it, he needed to follow it, otherwise, the other path set for him was to be eternally forced upon him.\n\n“If only…”\n\nResting his head on the desk, he could hear and feel the droplets of rain reverberating in his ears as if something was bickering from below.\n\n「I can just drift away.」\n\nThat was his call for a fantasy. His ambition reaching a stalemate, he simply wanted to dream; dream of the world that lied within his mind. Many times he brought his imagination forth in the form of words on paper but never was he actually able to fully realize it, even within a dream. But now… he longed for it the most, the salvation of divine manner.\n\nIt was then that he sought out to follow Myung’s steps in his own way. He raised his head back up and grabbed a book of the same name mentioned in the broadcast — he was glad to have bought it before as he did not have all her works at that time — and opened it up to the chapter she mentioned.\n\nMaybe within it, he could find the key he needed.\n\nLooking at the novel, going through its pages again, and remembering its plot brought Zachary to thinking back about the incident at school earlier. The novel starred a teenage girl who encountered abnormal incidents after all. It was eerily similar to what was happening. But why should he bother? He thought. It was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nAnd that was when his mind kicked in and delved deeper.\n\nWhy was it not out of the ordinary? He thought back once again.\n\nOccurrences of students, girls, passing out at school, specifically in front of the entrance, should never be considered ordinary at any point. It was common sense. But it didn’t stop there. The strings of suicide that he heard so much about were certainly something that should make headlines in the town, yet barely anyone ever heard of them outside. For all his habits of avoiding conflicts, this was one he couldn’t believe no one, not even himself, did not bother with. Everyone just moved on and lived as if nothing happened, as if it was all the norm.\n\n「Have I stumbled upon a paranormal conspiracy?」\n\nHe chuckled quietly to himself, thinking of the absurdity of the situation.\n\nSuch a thing as the paranormal was not so far-fetched. This is a world governed by a great deity, a world of angels and demons, a world of life and afterlife, that much he knew but did not believe. Yet in his own manner, he strived for perfection that a hollow shell could not achieve, a beauty that did not exist within his knowledge. He was not one looking to be a big-shot, making money off his works.\n\nLike any other person, he was once a child with a dream — and he wasn’t going to let it go to naught after all of these years.\n\nPutting those thoughts to rest, for now, he proceeded to read the rest of the chapter.\n\n“It was a pond. A magnificent pond surrounded by light fog from all sides.”\n\nHe read the first paragraph.\n\nThis chapter was supposed to revolve around the heroine wandering into a mysterious forest and meeting the maiden who would act as the catalyst for the novel’s events.\n\n“It looked neither natural nor artificial. Existing in a serene medium between nature and humanity it welcomed all with its warm water and calming light. It looked like a beacon from afar, shining its light through the dense forest beckoning all to embrace the silent water. Yes… it was silent for there were no fish to disturb its still form and no wind to guide its entropy. It was not surprising; these things are rare now. Within the forest of frozen trees and under the unmoving sky it rested as it always has.”\n\nBefore long Zachary found himself shutting his eyes as he read the lines, faced only with quivering darkness thereafter. Reading the story once again would not benefit him at all, which was why he wanted to understand how these words were formed, how they came to be from a mere dream. If he could materialize them within his own canvas of imagination, then maybe there was hope for him.\n\nFrom just the memory of the rest of the chapter, he let his mind waver to its heart’s content. It was no different than a canvas covered in black. White lines began to form around this void of a surface, slowly drawing and picturing a world of terrifying magnitude, a world only in one’s mind. The dark picture with white faint details soon began to fade and a brighter image, a clear image, came in its place.\n\nWhat appeared before him was no different than a scene in reality.\n\nFor once, he was able to realize a picture within his imagination. Normally such an achievement would cause one’s heart to flutter in excitement after failure for so long, but he was not one to hold such customs. He valued the moment and needn’t waste it on useless sentiments that cause a stir within the heart and mind.\n\nThere she was, Zachary could not believe his eyes, a maiden in the pond.\n\nHer appearance was barely visible due to the mist surrounding her. But even from the silhouette, Zachary was able to tell how good of a shape she maintained with her body. She moved in a slow manner, seemingly bathing in the pond’s warm water. This was exactly what Zachary needed, a scene out of his mind so vivid he could write into words.\n\nHe knew who this was: the Lady of the Lake, a very prominent character in the novel. Yet he couldn’t formulate what she looked like exactly as she had no definite appearance in the story itself. That was the sole reason why he wanted to move forward, he wanted to see what his mind had hidden away from him, what this beautiful woman he always tried to imagine would actually look like in this dreamscape.\n\nAnd then she began humming; humming a tune that was unfamiliar to him. It was soothing to the ears.\n\nZachary moved, slowly creeping his way to the pond and beyond the mist.\n\nThe chanting went on, her voice had turned from a young womanly voice to a beautiful voice worth a theater of audience.\n\n“This is…”\n\nThis was the wonderful world buried deep within Myung’s books, despite its dark imagery at times, fully realized within his imagination. This was the world he longed for the most: the bright-colored world, a world only those who have reached the dream could see and understand. Perhaps Myung was different, he thought. It could be that she really was happy and content with her life. She was someone who understood very well the dark image of the world yet she managed to portray such an amazing world.\n\n“If this is true, then I want it too. This is amazing!”\n\n“What’s amazing?”\n\nFollowing that other feminine voice, the world went dark. Zachary opened his eyes. He was back in that warm outmoded room. No pond. No maiden. No song. Just a girl with a stern expression looking down on him.\n\nHe quickly covered his notes, preventing the girl from seeing them.\n\n“What are you doing here?” He gave her a cold glare.\n\nThe girl before him was his cousin, almost three years older and in the same school as him — due to being held back a few years for an unspecified reason. Though she was a person he tried to avoid as much as possible, despite always listening to her words normally — he had to, she was family above all.\n\nShe had a fierce and threatening look in her eyes.\n\n“Aunt Rose asked for you, it’s time for dinner.” She gave him a monotonous stare, one that would be given from one stranger to another. They might have been cousins, but they were far from being alike.\n\n“I am not hungry.” He looked the other way, “Piss off!”\n\nThat last line was enough to set her off.\n\nShe grit her teeth. “…you’re just the same as ever.”\n\nAs the frustration built up within her, she vented it out by slamming her elbow to the back of his head.\n\nZachary let out an audible grunt. “Hey, what the hell was that for?”\n\n“Stop moping around and grow a pair. It’s not like you do anything else,” her expression was maddening. “Ungrateful prick...”\n\nShe was like everyone else in the household. No matter how hard they tried, there was no helping Zachary. They were all angered by his behavior and his rejection of everything. But unlike them, his cousin wasn’t one to hide her emotions behind a facade.\n\n“Get out…” He mumbled. “Shut up and get the hell out of here!” He tried not to raise his voice so as to not attract attention from anyone else in the house.\n\nHe stood up and glared at her with an irritated expression. But she was not the least bit afraid and she glared back. However, there was no use to all of this. She knew he wouldn’t listen.\n\n“—Tch…”\n\nShe moved aside but kept looking at him from the corners of her eyes as she headed for the door, not letting go of the hostility within. Knowing her, she would probably report back to his mother and more trouble would stir up. But then again, he barely knew anything about her, there was no guarantee she would say anything — and no guarantee she wouldn’t either.\n\nBut Zachary did not care.\n\n「I’m tired」\n\nFurious by the previous encounter, he sat back on the chair and struck his fist on the desk that it almost hurt. He wished to shun everyone out, to listen to no one but himself. They had no right to dictate his life, it was his own. However, he knew doing that would only drop ignorance upon him. There had to be boundaries to be set, otherwise, he wasn’t going to make that far in this world.\n\n「I’m really tired.」",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 3 - A Heroine\n\nheroine /ˈhɛrəʊɪn/\n\nthe chief female character in a book, play, or film, who is typically identified with good qualities, and with whom the reader is expected to sympathize.\n\nThe next day was not much different from the day before. More useless gossip and baseless rumors. Rain still persisted as if it was the middle of winter.\n\nThe only thrilling news that day was the fact that Mrs. Grace had taken a day off, meaning no literature class that day. Everyone was beyond ecstatic to hear that, and Zachary did not mind as well. As long as it meant an extra hour of freedom, then he was all for it. But it wasn’t just Mrs. Grace who took the day off that day, there were several other teachers and students who did not show up, most likely due to the heavy rain. The school could have easily let this day off considering any work was barely being done, but a school is a school, they would do anything to not let students out of their sight.\n\nNevertheless, it did not take long, the day was over in a blip.\n\nThere was no rush for Zachary this time, however. He packed his things at a slower pace than usual, to ensure that everyone would leave ahead of him and he would be able to leisurely walk through the hallways without the unnecessary crowds. No one paid attention to him so there was no harm in that.\n\nWalking through the hallways, free of the sense of urgency, he was able to make it to the entrance with minimal effort (and without someone or two pushing him twice). Before stepping outside, he glanced over to his left, to the bathrooms, where a girl had passed out the day before.\n\nIt was empty and quiet. No soul in sight. Seeing it like this made Zachary question the oddity of the situation and when exactly did he get used to witnessing that scene several times. However, he decided to not press further over the matter as it was a waste of energy. He needed that wasted energy for other fundamental things.\n\nAround this time, especially with the weather outside, the drama club would take this chance to practice for their play that was set for the end of that year. Unlike normal occasions, the club that year aimed for something that was neither a direct play of an existing drama or a made-up story by one of the students. Instead, they twisted the curve and aimed to make a modernized adaptation of “Othello,” one of the many dramas by the Bard of Avon himself, William Shakespeare. Quite a hefty and bizarre topic but not entirely out of the question for the drama club.\n\nThe club once reached out to Zachary, so naturally, he knew about what they had planned, but he wanted nothing to do with them. Tragedies were out of his area of expertise after all.\n\nAs much as he preferred rain, he did not account for it to happen again so soon — two days in a row was certainly a rarity. It was merely the start of Fall. So for the rain to happen suddenly was unexpected, to say the least. That wouldn’t have been the case if Zachary had listened to any of the forecasts that morning, and the day before. Everyone besides him seemed to have prepared for the occasion, as most students walked out with umbrellas in hand, sheltering themselves from the rain so easily.\n\n「Nothing’s ever easy, huh.」\n\nHis mind wavered to shift the blame on his mother, who couldn’t bother to warn him about the weather changing. But then again, he didn’t get the chance to encounter her that morning. His mother had no particular job to occupy herself with that would keep her from seeing her son before he left for school. In a world without her husband and a family that turned her down for years, however, she had other matters to attend to.\n\nDespite his distaste for that, he wished for normality in his life, in his mother’s life. Something that wouldn’t make this ever so mundane life a page out of Orwell’s book.\n\nAnd so, he stood out there, waiting for God’s blessing to rain down on him and forge a safe path for him to leave. He watched and gazed afar. One droplet after the other, rapidly increasing and decreasing at the same pace, a perfect balance of the chaos the rain imbued.\n\n“Dit nud plottupp cerd uk zolo, pniz ug zint.”\n\nA muffled voice… once again. There was still faint noise in the surroundings, as students walked by and left. But this voice was much closer than the others.\n\nIt was then that he noticed her.\n\n“Pe ug waxank te skaxalo up umflorraxa?”\n\nA girl standing by his side, looking into his eyes with the most innocent gaze in her crystal clear eyes. She wasn’t much shorter than him, but it was enough to have her look up at him. Her attire was very much like his, excluding the skirt she wore and the jacket she lacked, so it was indeed a student from the school, a student that was not in his class. Zachary knew everyone in his class, despite rarely talking or listening to them. Outside of that, he knew nobody.\n\nFor the first time in what felt like forever, Zachary could see it.\n\nA clear face; a clear bright face with no faults, no noise. Her sapphire eyes were dazzling with sparkles of chastity and made a perfect contrast to her brown hair that was wrapped up in a ponytail. She bore no ill intent. Zachary could sense it.\n\n“C-Can you hear me?” The girl uttered.\n\nHis eyes lit. His ears opened.\n\nSomething bizarre was happening, and it wasn’t particularly unpleasant.\n\nThe will to listen; the will to see, they all rushed back to Zachary like a chance meeting with a very dear old friend. A saving grace, the girl was. That was the only thing he could think about at that moment. Her presence was fantastical, almost illusory. It was as if the princess from a fairy tale came to rescue, not the prince, but the lowly peasant no one accounted for.\n\nBut even so, he still had his doubts to the depths.\n\n“Were you… were you talking to me?” He pointed a finger at himself.\n\n“Duh. Who else would I be talking to? You’re the only one here.”\n\nRid of the muffled noise and of the words that clouded his eyes, Zachary could hear the girl’s soothing voice echoing in his ears. It was the first time for an outsider to break through his shell so easily. Such an action was well enough to make a deaf person drop to tears.\n\nFeeling the normality he wished for seep into his life in a sudden manner, his alarms went off. The girl broke his shield, but what was next? What could possibly entice a girl from his school to interact with the black sheep he was? And he wasn’t one to hide feelings or embarrassment aside, he felt nothing after all. If he were to be blunt, he was going to be exactly that.\n\n“The hell do you want?” He blatantly asked, his dead eyes not averting her gaze, building up a barrier of hostility to keep her away.\n\n“Huh?!” The girl tilted her head in confusion.\n\n“I mean, why are you talking to me?”\n\nStill stuck with a bed head and a mean look to his eyes, he was convinced his appearance was threatening to others. That was why everyone stopped approaching him, he believed, and he stopped approaching any stranger, even the few classmates of his.\n\nThe girl chuckled, “I was asking you earlier if you wanted to share my umbrella… at least till we reach the station — you take the subway, right?”\n\n“You mean… the tram? Yes, but… but what is it to you?” He averted his gaze and looked at the station that wasn’t that far off outside the school. His earlier response was due to him taking the metro the day before as the clinic was quite the distance away from his school. But his house, on the other hand, was easy to reach through the tram system. “The tram is preferable, if I may be frank. It’s easily accessible and through your own card as well. No need to look for platforms and such, or face the trouble of going from one station to another. It just drops you to the nearest station to your desired location… and all above ground, of course.”\n\nIt was then that he halted his speech. He felt as though he said more than he should, even elaborating unnecessary information the girl might— or will definitely find odd.\n\n“Interesting! I never knew that…”\n\nWhat came out of the girl’s mouth wasn’t a sign of confusion, it was genuine curiosity. He did not know whether to praise the girl for withstanding his rubbish and responding to it with satisfaction or to ridicule her for feigning interest. There must have been an ulterior motive, he believed so.\n\n“I’m Lauren by the way.” She extended her hand outward offering a handshake.\n\nIt was truly baffling in his eyes. However, he grabbed her palm and shook it. He knew better than to embarrass her, and himself even more — he was not a dunce after all.\n\nBefore he could utter a word of his own, the girl interrupted.\n\n“You’re Zach, right?” She said with a bright smile on her face.\n\n“I suppose so…” He uttered, filled with monotony, trying to avoid the conversation she was desperately aiming to ignite.\n\nThe fact that she knew of his identity was quite a surprise that almost slipped past him. He had many questions already racking up noise in that little brain of his. Why was he complying with her rather than push her away with his usual grim attitude? There was absolutely nothing to gain from approaching him. She completely dominated the conversation, fully aware of his inept nature, yet she continued on ignoring that he was always to be the blackened sheep cast aside from the group.\n\nBut it was then that he decided to not be fiddled with any longer. If he wanted to know the reason behind the girl’s approach, rather than asking questions within his mind, he should press on the subject head-on. Because other than that she was the girl before him, he suspected she was someone else as well.\n\nAfter all, there was no mistaking… the brown hair, the attitude, the persistence, it was all...\n\n“Are you…,” he tried to gather his words, “Are you the girl always stalking me?”\n\nNot one for mincing words, he let out the truth in his mind. If he was wrong, he did not care. If she was not the girl, then it would simply be a look of confusion and disgust on her part and she would leave him alone, never to talk to him again, which was great success for him and the result he wanted the most.\n\nHowever, the girl smiled.\n\n“What if I am?” She was neither confirming nor denying it. Though her knowledge of that fact, something that only he and the girl would know, only proved the truth of the matter better.\n\nComing to that revelation, he did not hold back. “Then what in the bloody hell do you want from me? Someone set you up for this?”\n\n“Woah! Hey hey, tone it down. Sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it. I just saw you had no umbrella, so I thought of lending a helping hand. One good deed a day keeps the bad luck away, isn’t that what they say?” Despite the hostile nature of Zachary’s questions and his manner of speaking, the girl still kept the friendly attitude on, even laughing at the end. She took a slight step away, not for her own safety but for the fact that she felt she made him uncomfortable, “They weren’t kidding about the paranoia, huh.”\n\n“Who?” He turned to face her directly, “What are they saying about me?”\n\n“Uh… well, you know… it’s just gossip, nothing noteworthy really. I was just trying to—”\n\n“—trying to help…” He chuckled, keeping the smile behind his sarcasm still. “Yes, I know, thank you very much.”\n\n「I’ve had my fair share of those.」\n\nBut nothing was more irritating that moment than the fact that she, the girl he avoided for so long, the one he knew was a threat to his comfort, was able to finally break through to him and speak. He could not decipher why she was special, why his mind opened up to her (even with the bits of hostility) when she seemed just like everyone else when he tried to reject her the most.\n\nThere was no such thing as a good deed, no selfless act. Every single person was after their individual gain in some manner or form.\n\n“Why are you always after me?” He let out a sigh of defeat and quietly spoke, “Day after day after day, you always try to catch me outside the classroom, always try to talk about something. Why?”\n\nWithout another word, the girl pulled out her umbrella and took a step outside. It was just as he had expected, one misstep and he would be left alone. No one would want to bother with the likes of him, with someone who was always bent on living off negativity.\n\nHowever… reality that day was not in his favor.\n\nThe girl did not take another step.\n\nShe stood there, right in front of the entrance, for a good minute before turning around and facing Zachary once again. The smile on her face was gone and instead replaced with a rather disappointed and resolved expression. Anything from that meant she had something up her sleeve and that she wasn’t planning to leave him alone.\n\nAnd exactly as he predicted, she let out a helping hand.\n\nHer hand gesture was clearly inviting him to join her under the umbrella, to take shelter together from the rain. Unlike those who passed before, she had the heart to care, the faith to hope, and she wasn’t going to leave him for his fate like that.\n\n「Just what do you…」\n\nBefore Zachary could finish that thought, she spoke up and rushed to grab his hand. “Oh, come on, stop thinking about it and let’s go. We’re gonna miss the tram or whatever.”\n\nAnd just like that, the girl pulled him out of his shell, taking him by her side.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nWho was this girl?\n\nZachary could not help but ponder that question. Anyone with a sane mind would know better than to approach him, let alone talk to and accompany him in such a manner.\n\nHe almost tripped as the girl rushed him but he caught himself at the last second. She moved ahead and he followed quickly beside her so as to not let himself drown in the rain. They kept their march on, not uttering a word to each other, but not shedding bitterness to one another either. Zachary was too caught up in his mind that he couldn’t process the situation. As for the girl, she just carried the umbrella with a smile, satisfied that she was able to achieve her goal.\n\n“Why are you doing this?” He asked.\n\nIf he were to be put in an opposing position, if he were to be in the girl’s place, he was sure that he would not help himself. Even if it was anyone else, happy or sad, kind or cruel, rich or poor, he would not help them. No one cared to stop anymore. That was just how the world was.\n\n“Is there any reason not to?” That was the answer she responded with.\n\nAn answer baffling enough to keep him in a whirlpool.\n\nThinking back, he was surprised at finding himself able and willing to speak with the girl instead of brushing her off — he even went as far as to tell her what was the right method of transportation. It was true that he was quite hostile towards her, but he could have done what he did best and ignored her. Yet he spoke up. Deep down, he wanted a reason to speak up, he just didn’t know it.\n\nStill, he failed to find comfort in this silent stroll across the rain. There was nothing on his mind to bring up in a conversation.\n\n“Oh, have you heard?” The girl said in an almost disinterested manner.\n\nThis story has been taken without authorization. Report any sightings.\n\n「Great! Another rumor, that’s what everyone’s good at these days.」\n\nThere are always certain methods to start a conversation: “Check it out!” or “Listen to this!” or “Have you heard?” Just these three keywords are enough to spark interest in the listener’s eyes and tangle their ears like an antenna. But they also happen to be major benefactors in starting up a rumor. Almost no conversation nowadays started without a rumor. That was why Zachary had his suspicions — and why he was extremely tired of them.\n\n“What? Old man Philip finally bit the dus—”\n\n“I heard Hye-mi Myung is holding a meet-and-greet and a writing contest on her behalf in the next few days.” Said the girl with her eyes sparkling with curiosity. “— The deadline for the submission is pretty close. But like, is that actually true? I mean, can you believe it? In this town?”\n\n“Huh?!” Zachary stopped in his tracks, almost getting the rain to drop on him before the girl turned a few steps backward with her umbrella to cover him. “W-Who are you talking about?” He smiled wryly, feigning ignorance to the fact that he knew very well who she was talking about.\n\nThis was the first time he ever met a potential fan of Myung’s work in real life, yet he did not want to talk about her. He did not want to waste energy.\n\n“Well, look at that… you actually can smile,” she pointed out his out-of-character behavior (in terms of his “normal” behavior) which took him by surprise as well. “Anyway, I thought you actually knew her. You’re not one for gossip, aren’t you?”\n\n「Why would anyone be? It’s a pain in the ass. Both for us and for them. There’s nothing to gain. Just a waste of energy to everyone.」\n\nIf there was one thing he got right in his life, it was his resentment for rumors and gossip. It wasn’t out of a personal experience, he was always out of the picture that nothing of what he did garnered much attention, and even if one did, he didn’t have it in him to care.\n\n“Anyway, you can just forget about what I was going to say since you don’t know her and all—”\n\n「Good, don’t care anyway.」\n\nBut what came out of his mouth was completely different.\n\n“I know of her, the author of “Stage-Set,” right?”\n\nWhy did he press the conversation further? He didn’t know. He was in a bizarre conflict with his own mind, a battle of actuality and delusions.\n\n“Yes yes,” the girl seemed happy, satisfied that she was able to converse with someone of his likeness. “If you “know of her,” then you probably know about her strange antics, amirite?” She said with a sly smile as she pushed her elbow against his arm.\n\n“Antics?!”\n\nThis time, Zachary was completely clueless about what she was referring to.\n\n“Well, you see,” she chuckled, “She has this certain attitude that I can’t put a finger on, sometimes it feels like she’s looking down on everyone — at least that’s what I thought initially — but that’s where the antics come in, she does a lot of stuff any of us could do, gets in trouble like anyone else, and doesn’t act almighty at all, she’s so down-to-earth. Yeah, I know I have a knack for bringing people together, but she’s just on another level that I don’t know if I can strive to. She’s good at what she does.”\n\n「She sure likes the sound of her own voice.」\n\nIt was at that point that he also happened to realize that her accent seemed outworldly and a bit simpler than his. He was always used to hearing that only in movies and the like, never in real life.\n\nThat aside, Zachary found himself more interested in the stories about Myung’s character as it felt bizarre yet enticing to hear it from another person and what they think of her. He never knew Myung personally nor of her true personality.\n\n“But why are you so interested in Myung?” He expressed his thoughts without an ounce of hesitation, “Why do you compare yourself to her?”\n\n“Why?!” She stopped all of a sudden and looked at him with the most serious expression, showing off her determination toward that vague goal he was yet to know about. “It’s just… I wanna be like her. So many times, I find myself reading her books for hours on end — I know everyone probably feels the same and it’s not something new — but I just… fall deep into her world and feel this amazing sensation. And then I think to myself… I wanna do the same… I want to write and bring people into my world, I want to inspire others just like she does to me. I’m tired of sitting back and doing nothing and just listening to my parents bossing me around. Everything just seems so black and white when I’m not reading her books. But it makes me think, if she sees her world as she portrays it, then maybe I can be like her too. I want to be an author.”\n\nIt was then that Zachary’s thoughts halted.\n\n「Those words…」\n\nThose were his own words, his own feelings, his goal for escaping this monotonous life.\n\n“Y-You…” He looked for an answer, “Why did you talk to me? Why do you want to be an author?”\n\n“I knew it!” She let out a wide smile, letting her teeth shine bright like a crystal. “Okay, confession time… I read your short story that you submitted last year. Please don’t get mad!”\n\n“W-Wait, wha…?” Zachary took a step away from her in shock.\n\n“I mean, it was a little gloomy— but I sorta understood it, there was a certain theme, almost close to Myung’s bizarre and bright themes.”\n\nIt was true.\n\nA year prior, Zachary had just begun writing his own original short stories and a short story contest happened in the school a few weeks after that, prompting him to write one solely for it.\n\nUnlike most of the other stories that were fantasy-focused, his story was a bit bizarre — which was why it was not able to earn first place but was good enough to be an honorable mention. A character-centered story about an author’s mind struggling for a change in his life. That was what it was about. The story could have been considered fantasy in its own way as it was inside the twisted mind of the author with fantastical elements here and there, but like the judges said, it was “too vague.”\n\nDespite that, it was all too similar to many things he had read about, and to him specifically, but it was one he felt the need to write at that time. And that was what garnered the girl’s attention towards Zachary.\n\n“It was like a more complicated version of Alice In Wonderland if you ask me,” she laughed, switching the confident tune in her voice to a more awkward one, “But… I liked it. At least, it got a bit of recognition, mine was thrown completely into the trash. The concept of a creator trapped within a cascade of his own mind was really well done here.”\n\n「So this is what it was all about…」\n\nAll the bickering. All the stalking. All the discomfort she brought him was of his own product. If they hadn’t met today, she would have probably chased him to the ends of the Earth for this one thing, just to praise his work and nothing else.\n\nAfter finally figuring out the reason behind her interest in him, he could not bring himself to hate it.\n\nOut of everyone, his family, his classmates, the judges, it was the girl with barely any experience, just a simple reader, that managed to understand his work, that found potential under all the rumble. It meant nothing in reality, this girl could not bring him to the major leagues or help him be recognized in any way, but her words made his heart almost flutter. It helped him realize that even if he could not understand emotions all too well, he could still make something that replicates it.\n\nBut…\n\n「There’s no point to it.」\n\nLike shadows crawling back from the darkness, the negative lingering thoughts came back. Memories of him weeping in his desk riddled his mind, of how he struggled to find reason for what he wanted. The desire for a colored world would not suffice as a strong resolve in his mind.\n\n“It was honestly… inspiring in a way,” the girl placed the fingertips of both her palms against each other and smiled, “So you see, I wanted someone to attend the meet-and-greet with me and I’ve had my eye on you for quite some time as you might have noticed.” She chuckled, “No pressure or anything, of course. You just seem like the perfect guy for it since we are kinda like each other. I thought maybe, just maybe if we meet up with her, we could be one step closer to what we want.”\n\n「No no, that’s just wrong.」\n\nEven with her perfect attitude and answers, it was still wrong in Zachary’s eyes.\n\n“And if we do that, and nothing happens, then what?” He offered his honest opinion, “What if you’re wrong?”\n\n“Huh?!” She took a step back.\n\nThat optimism and blind judgment of hers were in the wrong place, she would be no different from his father or any of his other idols that were lost in time.\n\nWithout knowing much about her, just from her words, he saw the girl as one who possessed one story within, and once she was done with it, there was nothing else, she would be lost to time just like the others as well. And frankly, Zachary saw himself as the same. All his stories revolved around a similar topic in each of their own ways. He believed that once he could properly portray it, he would have nothing else. If luck deemed his idea a success, it would not be for the next one.\n\nThat was what he feared the most, why he did not want to finish his story.\n\n“It’s all about time and luck,” he said with a firm belief in his words, “We could put all our effort into it but it would mean nothing if we don’t have those two elements. So many people give it their all and yet we know nothing about them! How would we be any different?”\n\n“What’s the point of questions if you don’t try?” The girl interrupted, her face full with a bundle of frustrated emotions as she struggled to win against Zachary’s dark delusions, “Sitting around and imagining the worst won’t get you answers. And you won’t get them unless you try.”\n\n“Try, try and try again? Finish one goal by pure luck and then onto the next with completely nothing. When will it stop being a struggle?”\n\n“That’s what makes it special! If there’s no struggle, then what’s the point? If I just drop down words and call it a novel then is that really a good thing? If you could write without struggling, would you feel good about yourself?”\n\n“So what? You’re in it for the pain?”\n\n“The struggles, the pain you’re talking about, bears all my emotions. A story without one is just hollow, it’s meaningless. If I don’t put my all, my highs and lows, into it then it will come off as empty. That’s what it takes to make a story like Myung!” The girl was shouting. She was frustrated by his refusal to truly listen to her argument, she wanted to get her point across but he simply wouldn’t let her. But when she realized how loud her voice had become, she widened her eyes in surprise and turned back a bit, “I’m… I’m so sorry for… snapping like that. I just hate it when someone— N-Nevermind…”\n\n「You...」\n\nHow did it come to this? Both of them wondered. A simple conversation between two youths of the same desire somehow almost turned into a full-blown argument of conflicting passions. It was clear that each of them saw that same passion in a completely different light from the other. There was still that single thread left, the one to determine their own sides on the spectrum. If it were to be cut, then the answer was pretty clear, ergo that lingering question that was still on Zachary's mind.\n\n“You still haven’t answered my question,” Zachary was persistent, “You keep talking about how you can overcome this and how you can write that, but why even do it? What’s the point in any of this? If I follow your advice and put all my pain into my story but it doesn’t succeed, then what was the point?!”\n\nHe was looking for answers to his own questions, questions about himself. He wanted something new and convincing enough to cling onto. But deep down, he knew the answer.\n\n“Why do you want to be like Myung? Why do you want to be an author? Why do you do this?”\n\n「Don’t you dare say it. Be different.」\n\n“I…” She hesitated for a moment, holding her grip against her chest, and, with all her might, let out her answer with a smile. “I want that bright-colored life, you know.”\n\n“...!”\n\nFeeling his heart drop after hearing those words, Zachary could only stare at her in shock.\n\nBoth of them fell silent after coming to that revelation.\n\nTheir silence was soon enveloped within the rain.\n\nAt that moment, the rain seemed louder than ever before, as if it would turn into a waterfall from the sky to drown them all. It felt like a huge barrier standing between the words that were to be said in the next moment.\n\nEach of them was in their own thoughts.\n\nZachary looked down and sighed deeply, “You are wrong about me… You’re not like me.”\n\nWithout letting his sights escape the ground, he walked away, letting the rain drop down on him like bullets, and leaving the girl alone to her dilemma.\n\nThis was the final straw.\n\nHe shouldn’t have joined her when she told him to. He shouldn’t have talked to her. He should have ignored her and went about with his colorless life as usual. He was content with it, it was the life that did not end with him being at the short end of the stick, forgotten and alone.\n\nIt was all a mistake.\n\n“W-Wait—”\n\nAs she called for him, he walked faster, to get away from the rain as quickly as possible, to get away from her.\n\nThere were so many questions in his mind, so many struggles that he didn’t want to solve.\n\nHe wanted to run away from it all, and so he ran.\n\nHe ran without a second thought, leaving everything that could be behind him and facing only what should be. That girl was a wake-up call to him, that was what he believed, a wake-up call of what not to do. She was blinded by the same goals and followed them believing she was happy.\n\nBut there was no such thing as happiness.\n\nThat was the truth, the truth of Zachary Ashworth, a man who was never allowed to have what he wanted, to be happy. Whenever he asked for something as a child, he would always be met with rejection. That was how it was all the time.\n\nZachary wanted things. Zachary never got them.\n\nGrowing in a poor household, he barely had a chance to know what it was like to get what he wanted. If he were to want that desire, there would only be failure at the end of the road. And there was nothing more to fear in the world than failure. That applied not only to the materialistic things but to everything that shaped what his life would become. Even if he desired a chase, he learned to chase after what he needed and not what he wanted.\n\nHe would always be told to be content with what he had and be happy with it. He would always be told that so much was being done for him, that he should shut up and follow along so happiness would come for him.\n\nHappiness does not come to those who ask, and it does not come to those who stay silent, it does not exist. That was what he was told.\n\n「So why is she happy?」\n\nIt frustrated him.\n\nThe girl had the same desires, the same goals, and almost the same life, but she lived it in a completely different manner. She pushed aside all the negativities, while also keeping them in mind, and looked at the grey world between the black and white one. Yet still, she wanted neither, she aimed for the world that rarely existed: the bright-colored world. A world only realized in books and seen in movies. The world Myung gave her readers on a silver platter. They need only believe and they can see it. After all, what is fiction but a piece of reality?\n\n「But it’s all hogwash… all of it.」\n\nHe stood idly at the station, staring down at the ground as he took shelter from the rain under the station’s roof. A red light was flickering several times at a leisure pace, signaling that the tram will arrive shortly.\n\nIn a few minutes it will come to a halt in front of the station, just as always, and he’ll step inside and leave, just as he does every day. There was no need for him to think of chasing a useless dream once again. It wasn’t like he, out of everyone else in the world, will change the world. It will move on without him like always.\n\n「Like always…」\n\nA gust of wind coursed through the station as the tram finally arrived. It was as if a storm was coming. The doors opened, and the few people that were nearby walked in. Everything was pointing toward that one path, the path that he always trod. He should leave… and never look back.\n\nBut he didn’t.\n\nAny person with resolve believed in only moving forward and never turning back to the past. It was a logical path to take. Naturally, Zachary should follow it as well and move on. That encounter was just a minor setback, a fever dream. Yet, he knew that even though he had the right mindset in a way, the path he walked was the wrong one.\n\n「The wrong path… right and wrong…」\n\nHe let out a deep breath that was visible to the eyes from the cold.\n\n「No! There is no right and wrong, or black and white — there never was — there is only a choice, just like mom once said.」\n\nHe nervously tapped his finger on the side of his leg.\n\n「It won’t matter if I choose to leave. It won’t matter if I choose to stay.」\n\nHe looked back at the path he came from.\n\n「Nothing will stop me from making a choice.」\n\nHe tightened his grip.\n\n「That’s right…」\n\n“...,” He desired the courage to speak up.\n\n「I’m free.」\n\n“I…”\n\n「Yeah, I’m free to do whatever I want.」\n\nHappiness does not come to those who ask, and it does not come to those who stay silent, it comes to those who choose it.\n\n“I want it…” The words finally escaped his breath, the words he desperately tried to reject for no reason.\n\nWith that choice finally in mind, Zachary turned his back to the direction of the tram, his last means of escape from the perilous choice he was about to make, and ran in the opposite direction, back to the rain and the mud.\n\nThey say there was once a boy who believed in nothing and acted upon nothing, and then he met a girl; a girl who showed him reason.\n\nAnd so the boy ran with all his might. Even in a world of hardships and forces that would always push one back, he moved forward, all in an effort to return to the girl and tell her the truth, to take her hand and walk together toward whatever road they would choose.\n\n「Please be there, please be there, please be there…」\n\nZachary still had a lingering fear in his mind that he might have missed his chance and made the choice too late. That girl could have left long ago. He wouldn’t blame her if she did so, it would only be a natural response to his actions.\n\nBut he didn’t want that.\n\nFor once in his life, he wasn’t content with things as they were, he wasn’t going to accept a result that didn’t suit him, he was going to get what he wanted. And what he wanted—\n\n「There!」\n\nShe was still there.\n\nThe girl was still standing on the side of the road with all her beauty and innocence. She held an umbrella to shelter her from the rain as she rested her back on the fence. This would be the time where Zachary would question why she stayed behind, no sane person would do so in weather this bad.\n\nBut he knew the answer: She was just like him, an idiot who had a belief.\n\n“Heeeey!!” He called out to her.\n\nShe turned her head in his direction and her face was lit with surprise.\n\n“I want it too!” Zachary shouted at the top of his lungs, not giving the slightest thought about the rain, throwing away the worries that clouded his mind for so long.\n\nHe stopped for a moment to catch his breath after all that running back from the station — he did not have the best stamina.\n\nHe faced the girl from afar with pride and resolve, and shouted once again.\n\n“I want to be like Myung. I want to write. I want to create. I want that bright-colored life too!!!”\n\nThe girl smiled.\n\nAnd so the boy with no reason in a colorless world finally started to see color.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 4 - To Dream\n\nimagination /ɪˌmadʒɪˈneɪʃ(ə)n/\n\nthe act or power of forming a mental image of something not present to the senses or never been wholly perceived in reality.\n\nFor the first time in almost a decade, Zachary Ashworth genuinely smiled.\n\nHe finally found a reason to truly cling onto. It was time to leave the lone cave and start walking a new road, a new road with someone of the same stitch.\n\nAs if, somehow, his words brought about a magical meaning, the rain came to a halt. One droplet after the other, it completely stopped. What came after was a beauty of a sight. The dark clouds dissipated as the bright sunray seeped in slowly from each gap, till the grey sky had disappeared, leaving only the sky in a cascade of twilight. It had happened so quickly that none had the words to describe it.\n\nThe girl put out her hand to check if the rain was truly gone. Realizing it was safe, she folded back her umbrella after shaking the remaining droplets off. However, it was then that she had noticed that the bright light of nightfall wasn’t the only thing in the sky.\n\nShe tilted her head upward.\n\nWith her mouth agape with joy like a child, she pointed at the sky. “Look!”\n\nZachary, who was taking his sweet time to recover from that long run back from the station, raised his torso back up and followed to where the girl’s finger was pointing. To his surprise, he was met by something fantastical; something he hadn’t truly seen before in the real world… a rainbow.\n\nIt was bright and colorful with its usual wide curved shape, but it was much more faded into the sky than to how it was depicted clearly elsewhere. This was reality, after all, nothing was as fantastical as it should be.\n\nEven then, the girl gave out all her wondrous reactions toward this rare event.\n\nOn the other hand, Zachary still felt nothing from it.\n\nYes, he recognized it to the full extent, but to him, it was anything but colorful. Just another black and white image along with the rest of the world he perceived. He looked at the girl’s dazzling childlike expression and her eyes that reflected the light of the sky. And then his gaze turned back at the sky and the rainbow, which were still painted in the colorless dusk. It was a desperate attempt, of a dreamful kid, to see the world through her eyes.\n\n「It’s not like something in me will change with just a few different words.」\n\nDespite his thoughts now, he had expected himself to have a change of heart when he made the decision to come back and tell the girl of his dream. Usually, in fiction, this would be the point the character’s mentality changes for better or worse, as it was a character shift after all. Yet he could not bring himself to disappointment.\n\nFiction was fiction. And this world was this world: reality.\n\nBut, unbeknownst to his closed-minded self, the girl was about to make it something more. She was truly going to inflict change.\n\nAfter admiring the scenery of the sky for no more than a few minutes, the girl turned her focus back on him.\n\n“So…,” she smiled with elegant confidence, “Are you really sure that’s what you want? To see a bright-colored world, I mean.”\n\nZachary lacked the words to express himself, due to him exploiting his exhaustion. But he didn’t lack the motivation, he wanted to be completely honest with himself, and he was dead-set on achieving his goal. He did not run through hell and back only to back away when the opportunity presented itself.\n\nHe nodded with a resolved look on his face.\n\n“I see…,” the girl placed her index finger right under her lower lip and looked away for a moment, as if she was thinking about something, “Alright! Meet me at the tram stop east of the school. Tomorrow. Right after school. Deal?”\n\n“Huh?!”\n\nZachary gave off a dumbfounded expression. He had no idea what the girl was planning. They had just met and she was already thinking of their next meeting. For someone who barely interacted with anyone in recent years, this was bizarre.\n\nThe girl got off her feet and took one lousy, yet large step after the other, as if she was a kid playing hopscotch.\n\nShe approached Zach with ease, “You wanna make it to the competition with me, right?”\n\n「The competition…」\n\nHe was caught up in his own thoughts that he had completely forgotten about this golden opportunity — it wasn’t exactly one as he had to earn it, but it was an opportunity nonetheless. A writing competition was being held soon by none other than his shining idol, Myung, which had her “meet and greet” event coincide with. It was the perfect chance; a chance to meet the author that inspired him in many ways and learn from her, and a chance to prove his worth in the literature world.\n\nThe girl leaned downward and still looked at Zachary with a smile, breaking off his train of thought.\n\n“We’ll need to broaden our horizons!” She spoke with much enthusiasm as she placed all her fingers against each other.\n\nWithout notice, the girl reached for her small bag and pulled a small, slightly torn piece of paper, before handing it swiftly to Zachary, who was still dazed by her abrupt and continuous actions.\n\n“I’ll give you the deets later tonight. M’kay?”\n\nJust as she showed up earlier that day with fantastical energy, she decided it was time to leave and quickly walked away. She waved her hand and arms back and forth for a grandiose farewell, till she had completely disappeared from his line of sight.\n\nZachary stood in his place, with the paper still in his hand. He was quite shaken by the events that took place that day, but more in a dumbfounded way than a fearful way. It was as if he expected something more to happen out of his “life-changing” decision. But he was only met with this sudden chain of actions and reactions from the girl.\n\nAnd before he could take the proper time to process it all, she was already gone.\n\n“What… just happened?”\n\nHe remembered her words, and how a certain thing she said did not align with the question she first asked when she met him.\n\n「Wait a minute…」\n\n“She does know about the tramway!”\n\nInstead of snapping his fingers for coming to that revelation, he frowned in frustration for the time he spent meaninglessly explaining something that she already knew.\n\n「She was playing me this whole time…!」\n\n“Just who the hell is this girl?”\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“Lauren Cherith…”\n\nZachary mumbled as he held the piece of paper high up while taking a look at it. It had the name of the girl and her number written on it.\n\nHe had spent a good half an hour in his room, sitting near his desk, trying to remember where he had heard that name before. As far as things went, she was just the girl who had her eye on him for quite some time now. And yet, he felt that something was missing, that there was more to her than meets the eye.\n\nIt wasn’t a thought, it was a fact. Her actions made it so. She might have shared a mentality with him to some extent, but she was much more outward with her feelings and desires than him. That miraculous girl was a perfect fit for an honor-student-type of character in a teenage story.\n\nHowever, it was when he realized that the simple joke was more of a reality than he had originally thought, that it all clicked in his memory.\n\n「There’s no way!」\n\nA dazed smile formed around his face.\n\nThat girl was the ‘Lauren Cherith,’ the prize student of his school. She was an American exchange student that enlisted the year before, and, from that brief encounter that day, seemed to have been still in the school considering it was the new year.\n\nAs he recalled from the many stories he had once heard about her, she was a three-time award winner of the ‘Writing Bee’ competition back when she was in elementary school and a two-time award winner of the annual ‘Magical Story Jars’ contest in middle school. The stories about her ended there, however.\n\nGuessing by the order in which she had won, it seemed that she had yet to win or enlist in any competition after those three prizes. This time it looked like she was aiming higher than ever before, as she wanted to join the new ‘Wonderworld Fantasia’ competition hosted by Myung, even going as far as getting him as well on the ride.\n\nIt was here that he found a peculiar gap in her resolve — at least, from what he knew about it. Judging by her track record, she was a winner and anything but the opposite.\n\nZachary tried to rack his brain as much as possible to find an answer to his question: Why would she go as far as get him to want to join the competition with her when they will be competing against each other? Why help a rival? Did she think too low of him that he wouldn’t surpass her?\n\n「Am I looking too much into this?」\n\nThat was the norm for him, to riddle his mind with doubtful thoughts.\n\n“But really…,” he mumbled to himself once again, “She really is different.”\n\nHe placed his palm on his face and sighed deeply.\n\nEach time he thought about it, he realized more how much of a gap there was in experience and perspective between him and the girl, despite being roughly the same age. He remembered the time he spent thinking of his decision in the station before he ran off to confront the girl, he wanted to remember the feelings he felt, the desire he wanted.\n\nWere they truly genuine?\n\nHe knew he felt something, yet he couldn’t shake the doubt that it might have been an illusion in his head.\n\n「Can I really change?」\n\nIf you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.\n\nTired of all the overthinking, he tilted his chair to the left and right, emptying his mind from all the useless assumptions. He moved his torso forward and rested both his elbows on his thighs while keeping his hand as a support for his head. He looked around his room to try and distract himself, but seeing as it was just a library, there was not much to see but books everywhere — and he wasn’t in the mood for reading.\n\nBut then came the distraction… a dangerous one.\n\n“...”\n\nZachary’s eyes widened with fright.\n\nIt was the entrance to his room.\n\nThe door was closed.\n\nThere wasn’t anything particular about a closed door… if it weren’t for the fact that he always kept the door to his room open. As a matter of fact, he preferred to keep all the doors to rooms he frequented to be open at all times, despite his inept nature that would seem to indicate otherwise.\n\n“...”\n\nHe stared at the door for quite some time, never to keep his eye off it. And as he did, he felt his chest tighten and his breathing get heavier. His mind was burning with the question of who closed his door.\n\nJust then… as his gaze prolonged for more than it should, the door got closer.\n\nIt was an unbelievable sight but… the door, the inanimate object, was moving, and not in the manner of it tilting back and forth due to the wind.\n\nNo—\n\nThe door, in its closed shut state, moved from its place, disconnecting itself from the wall. It inched closer in a straight path. There was no sound. No hard screech against the wood as it moved, and it was all the more terrifying. Perhaps it was simply Zachary being pulled closer to the door, but that wasn’t the case.\n\nThe door still moved.\n\nZachary felt a chill pass through his arm and run down to his spine.\n\nWith each passing second, it was getting harder to breathe normally. No matter how hard he tried to slow it down, it just got heavier and faster. He felt a lump in his throat and an itch on his hand.\n\nIn an effort to outsmart it — or to prove to himself that this was simply an illusion — he moved backward with his chair, and yet… the door advanced. He tried to stand up but it was then that an immense, terrifying pressure dropped down on him like a boulder.\n\n“Stop…” He averted his gaze.\n\nIt kept on its slow march toward Zachary. The closer it got; the bigger in size it seemed. Cracks were starting to appear on the door’s wooden surface, however, they were not of decay. They were claw marks, giant, horrifying claw marks carved recklessly onto the door. It was as if a beast lied hidden within and was rattling its cage to escape.\n\nAfter maintaining silence throughout her movements, it finally made a noise.\n\n*creaaaaaaaaaaaaaak*\n\nThe door slightly nudged itself open with a loud and prolonged screech, just enough to show what was behind it. Zachary shifted his gaze back. There was nothing behind it. No hallway. No light. Nothing, but complete darkness.\n\nZachary held onto his chest. He almost tore his shirt apart from how tight his grip was and how he kept pushing it away. His heartbeat was in a spiral. One moment, it would be the beating of exhaustion, and in another, it would be one beat closer to death.\n\nLooking at that void behind the door, he figured what it was. It was a tale as old as time. Stare long enough into that void and one will be swallowed whole by it, never to see the light again.\n\nBut he wasn’t going to let that abyss stare back at him.\n\nHe did not want that.\n\nHe did not want a world of complete darkness. He wanted just the world as it was, the normal world, the bright-colored world.\n\nWith no sight or sound, that would be a fate worse than death.\n\nHe instantly turned his head away and closed his eyes.\n\n「It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head.」\n\n“...”\n\nRight at that moment…\n\n*RING* *RING*\n\nHis hand shivered violently from all the buzzing against his chest.\n\nIt was his phone, which he had held onto this entire time. Still, with his body rolled up like a scared little child on the chair, he looked at the phone to see who was calling him at this time.\n\nOne glance… one glance at the caller ID was all it took to blow everything away, to break him out of that nightmarish world. He was back to the mundane world, the ridiculous world that he desired for the most at that moment.\n\n【Lauren from School】\n\n【(01524) 1018 2104】\n\nDespite saving her contact with that name, there was only one girl that went by ‘Lauren’ that Zachary has ever met in his life.\n\nHe quickly raised his head back up and looked at the entrance to his room. The door was still closed but it was back to its place. The darkness had disappeared. The silence was cut off by the continuous buzzing of the phone.\n\nEverything felt normal at that moment.\n\nLetting out a huge sigh of relief, he jumped out of his chair, to which he was held captive before, and roamed around the room while keeping the phone ring to itself. He held it up for a brief moment to look at it once again.\n\n「My savior…」\n\n“I’ve never felt happier before in my life to receive a phone call.”\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nWhy would the girl call at this time though? He wondered.\n\nIt had been an hour since he had returned from their wondrous encounter. He remembered how she mentioned she would give him a call later in the evening, but the darkness of night was barely even here. The skies were still coated in that mystical pale tint of orange.\n\nHis train of thoughts caused him to walk in circles.\n\nIt was a simple phone call, it’d be ridiculous not to answer it for so long like that. But his mind wavered and wavered.\n\nShould he answer, he will be dragged further down this “rabbit hole” that may or may not result in success. Should he not pick up the phone, perhaps the girl will forget about him and everything will return to the way it was.\n\nBefore he knew it, his thumb slid the “answer” button and opened up the call.\n\nFor a second, he panicked, “Oh oh! Uh… Hello!” He quickly placed the phone on his ear, he spoke with a humorous tone, “I thought you weren’t going to call till the evening.”\n\n“{Hey…!}” Her lulling and vibrant voice came through the phone, “{Ah, I just felt like calling you now. It’s not good to keep things off when you have the chance to do it earlier, amirite?}”\n\n“Yeah, totally, I get it!” He immediately agreed with her words, even though his mind wasn’t entirely in the right place at that moment.\n\n「What the hell are you saying, idiot?」\n\nHe lamented his erratic behavior from the inside. Just spouting those few words was enough to make him feel like he was one of those other kids at his school, and he surely did not want to be lumped in with them.\n\n“{Anyway, I figured I’d give you a little heads up about where we’re going tomorrow.}” She shifted the tone of her voice to a firm one to emphasize her seriousness, but even then she couldn’t hide the amount of spirit held within. “{Annnd, I wanted to know whether you’ll be up to it or not. Don’t wanna end up going by my lonesome after all.}”\n\n“We’re… going somewhere?”\n\nHearing that brought confusion to Zachary’s mind. He knew very well that they were going to go someplace. But the way the girl had put it out into words made it seem like there was more to it, which worried him greatly.\n\n「And weren’t my words enough to convince her I was in?」\n\n“{It’s not just somewhere…,}” the girl chuckled, “{It’s… I better keep it a surprise. But I need to know that you’re fully committed no matter what.}”\n\nWhen it came the time to confirm his determination once again, he felt his tongue stutter before saying anything.\n\nHe was hesitating.\n\nIt genuinely surprised him. After all these thoughts to himself, his idiotic mind was still stuck in that corner of the past.\n\n「I… I want to do this! I chose this!」\n\n“Yes! I did not risk myself catching a cold in that weather only to back out now,” He tried to hide his stress with a laugh.\n\n“{That’s great! I’m glad you’re still on,}” she was back to her excessively loud and energetic tone, “{Well, that’s all for now. It was fun talking to you, Zach.}”\n\nHis eyes widened after hearing her words. But before he could respond, the call had already ended.\n\nShe had hung up on him.\n\nDespite her friendly attitude, it seemed she was really not one for saying proper goodbyes, even on the phone. He looked at his phone to confirm that the call was over.\n\n「That was kinda… pointless?」\n\nHe was already dead-set on doing everything in his power and going beyond to change and get his story somewhere. The days of clinging to the background were over. But as he thought of that, his mind shifted elsewhere.\n\n“Zach…”\n\nHe mumbled to himself, remembering the way she had nonchalantly called him by his nickname at the end. He didn’t have the time to properly react to it then.\n\nAlthough that didn’t stop him from being weirded out by her behavior, she was acting as if they were best friends already — that nickname drop was the cherry on the top. Perhaps this was her way of making friends and making herself memorable.\n\nThose short interactions with her definitely left an impact on him.\n\nFrom one thought to another and then back, Zachary dropped onto the chair and sighed deeply. He was back to thinking about his decision.\n\n「I wonder if I really did the right thing.」\n\nWith his mind moving onto another thing once again, he found himself looking back at the door. He remembered the fear from before, and how he hated it; how he hated for the doors to be closed. However, this time, he wasn’t going to let fear get the better of him.\n\nThis time, it was anger.\n\nHe loudly scoffed before he got up to his feet and rushed to push the door wide open, “How many times have I said not to shut my door?!”\n\nIn his fit of rage, he was suddenly met by a maid standing in the hallway, who immediately jumped back in surprise from his aggressive bolt out of the room.\n\nDespite being visibly shaken by his actions, the maid quickly bowed down. “I deeply apologize for my hasty action, young master. I thought that you might have needed some quiet time for yourself. I am very sorry, sir.”\n\n「So it was… her?」\n\nIf she didn’t wear the signature black and white maid attire, he wouldn’t have taken her for one. She looked awfully young to be a maid, about his age or so from what he could determine. The look of distress and regret on her childlike face made him feel quite bad about rushing out like that.\n\n“I was assigned here recently, so I didn’t know better till a minute ago. I rushed back here as fast as I could.” She continued her apology, “But I know such a thing is not an excuse, and I am very sorry for that. Please forgive me, young master. I promise you with my life it won’t happen again.”\n\n“Uhhh…”\n\nZachary was more concerned about what they taught the maids here rather than the apology itself.\n\nIt was as if she had committed a great sin against his family. Yes, he was angered by the fact that his door was closed. Yes, it brought him stress. But it was just an honest mistake from a young and inexperienced maid.\n\nHe rubbed his forehead and sighed, “It-It’s fine. But listen, just… just keep it in your head at all times from now. Never close the doors to the rooms I frequent in this house, please.”\n\n“Yes, yes, I understand very well. It will never happen again and I’ll make sure of it with anyone else who doesn’t know.” She elegantly bowed instead of frantically leaning her torso down like before, “Thank you very much for your kindness, young master!”\n\n「Kindness…?」\n\nAfter this frantic encounter, Zachary was left in a state of disarray. He turned his head away and wondered when he had become kind again. He would always turn away the maids and ridicule them for their mistakes at every chance he got.\n\nYet things went differently this time… quite differently.\n\n「Is her influence rubbing off on me already?」\n\nHe had thought of the girl, he had thought of Lauren, and how her brief aura of light was the only thing of genuine color he would ever see in years. She was a girl who seemed similar to him in so many ways, yet she was still different from him. She had a different outlook on her life, facing the colorless world head-on and reaching for the greater colorful one.\n\n「Guess it might not be so bad, after all.」\n\nHe let out a quiet laugh and looked back at the hallway…\n\n...only to find the maid still standing there with an innocent, yet woeful expression on her face.\n\nZachary’s eyes widened, “You’re still here, huh?”\n\n“Oh? My apologies. You did not dismiss me, so I had thought that you desired something else.”\n\n“Uh huh…?” He tried to follow her logic, which was fairly simple — he just did not understand the ethics of this upper crust world he was dragged into. “Then… I uh… guess you can go now?”\n\n“Right away, sir!”\n\nShe bowed down in respect with a smile on her face, before walking away.\n\nAs she was gone, he was left with his thoughts once again.\n\nFive years.\n\nFive years he had been in this grand house, and this was the first-ever genuine interaction he had with someone in the house, even if it was a maid. He felt a strange feeling like he was proud of himself in some way.\n\nHe took that thought with him to his room and sat back again on the chair next to his desk. He moved it around to face the entrance as a precaution.\n\nThe door was wide open.\n\nEverything was fine.\n\nTired of these thoughts and words circling around in his head, he leaned his back against the backrest and reclined the chair — a position like this was miles better than sleeping in a bed for him.\n\nHe placed his arm on his forehead, just slightly covering his eyes, and slowly let out a deep exhale.\n\n「Hang in there…」",

Yet fate would have him be the subject of several “favors” that day, to people he never or rarely spoke with before, as if it was mocking him and spitting in his face.\n\nDue to the recent absence of Mrs. Grace, there was no one left assigned to his class for the literature subject, leading to an incompetent substitute teacher coming in her place. That teacher had him as her “assistant” that day, with help from a “unanimous” vote of the rest of his class.\n\nAnd so, he was thrown into situations he had never experienced before.\n\nOne minute he would be collecting papers from the students while they all left, and in the other, he would be rushing to deliver some late documents to the teacher’s “supervisor.” It was a cruel thing, almost ludicrous, having him carry the weight and the faults of a blundering tutor, and a temporary one at that.\n\nIf he weren’t so inept during school time (and was set on just passing the year without raising any trouble even if it cost him inconvenience sometimes), he would be out and about in the school halls, howling criticism over her.\n\nBut of course, a student’s worth amounted to nothing but dirt.\n\nTo Zachary, this was worse than a filler chapter in a shoddy teen drama book — not that he had particularly read anything of the sort.\n\n“Crap! I’m so late!” He came to a realization.\n\nMaking it in time for the meeting place with Lauren was just not in his forte that day. After he was done, he rushed out of the school as fast as possible.\n\n“Please be there!” He said as he made a run for it.\n\nPerhaps working his legs like this was going to be his claim to fame in his chase for that ultimate dream. It was a simple jest in his thoughts, but it was enough to put a smile on his face and make him push through.\n\nSprinting like this reminded him of the moment he ran out in the rain to get back to Lauren and tell her how he felt and what he truly wanted. He was even repeating the same words.\n\nThe difference this time, however, is that he had faith that the girl he almost left out in the rain yesterday was going to wait for him. But then again, his undesired, yet logical thoughts came back to him: there can only be so much time a person can wait for someone.\n\nMissing the meeting won’t mean the end but it wasn’t without consequences.\n\n“You have to… you have to…,” he was losing his breath, “You have to be there… please…!”\n\nHe had to make it no matter the cost.\n\nHe did not want that setback.\n\nHe had to run.\n\nWith vim and vigor, Zachary Ashworth ran.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nLauren Cherith did not particularly have anything of interest that day.\n\nBeing the optimal type of student, she was relieved of her duties in anticipation of this day. It may seem like her hangout invitation to Zachary the other day was out of the blue and something that came on the spot.\n\nThat wasn’t the case though.\n\nEverything that had gone down the day before; she planned for, not to the extent of every action taken or sentence that was said, so it was more like she anticipated it.\n\nBut it was all plausible.\n\nAfter all, she couldn’t let go of possibly the only person who understood her.\n\nDespite her popularity among students, she never felt truly at a place she was comfortable with till she spotted Zachary a year ago, writing his little short story in the school’s library. She was mesmerized by his determination as she would see him every day doing the same process — think, write, erase, repeat — and never looked bothered by it. It took all her power to finally approach someone as inept as he was.\n\nThankfully, it was all worth it. Hearing that he desired the same dream as she, was like music to her ears. She was finally going to find a place she was comfortable, even if it was with one person.\n\n“But where is he…?”\n\nHer disappointment slowly built up as she let out a melancholic groan.\n\nLauren ended up waiting at the station as intended, but a little earlier than usual. She thought leaving early would guarantee her a meeting with Zachary, as he would always be one of the first students to leave — excluding the other day where he was the last one to leave. Yet he was still nowhere to be seen.\n\n「Should I have waited in front of the school instead?」\n\nAs much of an organizer she was at most times, she also had her reckless and impulse-thinking moments.\n\nWith a few hours on end and nothing to do, she browsed her phone for anything of interest, to distract herself, till she waited a few more. He wasn’t picking up her calls and he wasn’t about to suddenly appear over the horizon. If he did not appear in the next ten minutes, which would be the third time the tram stopped by, then she would have to do nothing but take the ride and head to the location by herself — it was a place she would often visit, after all.\n\n「Please show up…」\n\nScrolling through eye-opening headlines and media posts that would usually take up all her time on her phone, she was still thinking about Zachary, this day, and nothing else. Her distraction was not working.\n\n*DING* *DING* *DING* *DING*\n\nThe bell echoed deep within her ears, frightening her for a second.\n\nRiding the tram a million times was still not going to stop the sudden fright she would get upon hearing the bell. They were a quarter through the twenty-first century, yet the tram was still stuck with the bell of a train from two centuries ago.\n\nShaking off the awkwardness of that moment from her head, she thought about Zachary again. There were a few people around so it was easy to distinguish him if he were here somehow, but he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nDoubt filled her mind and she felt the bottom of her heart ache.\n\n「Was I… wrong about him?」\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nIf this run was not hailed as the one for the century, then Zachary was… actually he wasn’t going to do anything, but he was going to be quite mad about it. He could drop dead on the ground and he would think of it as his crowning achievement.\n\nUp until now, he wasn’t much of an athlete, he still thought of himself as someone with an average build as he would keep up with daily exercise to make sure that health did not deteriorate. But he never imagined he would be speeding through a quarter of the town in less than ten minutes on foot.\n\nHis heart was on the verge of stopping. He felt a shortness of breath in his lungs. His legs felt numb yet still kept going.\n\nBut he did not care.\n\nIt was all worth the—\n\nJust as the thought came to his mind, he saw the rest of the street before him emerge. At the end of the horizon, was the girl he desperately broke himself for. She stood solemnly among a small crowd at the station. Seeing Lauren still in the place she mentioned brought him a huge sigh of relief. Not only because he got the station right, but because her words were truthful.\n\nThat sense of relief, however, was soon to dissipate.\n\nNot a second later and he saw Lauren climb onto the tram before the car started driving off.\n\nOf course, it was somewhat slower than most vehicles, and certainly a train, but it could still rival a human’s speed, especially against someone who wanted to stop running as much as the next person.\n\nNevertheless, Zachary still ran, putting in more speed in his legs. He used his motivation to reach Lauren as a boost and it worked perfectly.\n\nEven as he got closer, there was still the lingering feeling that he would not make it. This was the body of a human. There will come a time eventually before it deteriorates and completely collapses from exhaustion.\n\nHe had to do something about it, he thought. He had to call out to Lauren.\n\nIf he weren’t going to make it then he should at least make her know well that he still made it to the meeting spot.\n\nHe must shout, say something, anything, to not keep it all in.\n\nThe times of hiding most of his thoughts were a thing of the past. To advance toward his dream and the betterment of himself, he needed to be forthright and honest with himself.\n\nThis was something that he absolutely needed.\n\nAnd so, taking what little air remained in his lungs, he shouted, “Lauren!!!”\n\nOn the other side of the street, inside the tram, Lauren heard his voice.\n\nShe immediately looked away from her phone and leaned out of the open window. There was only one thought on her mind that made her smile: ‘I knew it.’\n\nShe quickly took a step down the stairs, held onto the pole, and brought out her hand for Zachary to reach. No one inside tried the minimum to warn her or pull her back, which worked to her benefit. No matter how dangerous doing something like this was, she could not worry about her own safety now.\n\n“Hurry up!” She finally shouted back at him with a look of confliction and resolve.\n\n‘I’m not gonna let you go,’ those were the words her eyes were telling him.\n\nZachary used his last resort and put all his barely remaining stamina into one final leap that would push him to reach Lauren’s hand.\n\nHe stopped for a second, took a deep step, before jumping forward near the car.\n\nShe immediately caught onto his hand.\n\nTaking a bit more of her strength to pull him in with one hand while holding onto the pole, she leapt backward. The two of them dashed inside and trampled on their feet in the process.\n\nWith a laugh starting to rise up in her throat, Lauren brought herself up on her feet and approached Zachary, who had crawled into the corner and sat there to take a breathing room for himself.\n\nThis was indeed the run of the century.\n\n“And here I thought you dipped out on me,” she put on a wry grin, “I missed out on two stops, because of you, before I sorta gave up.”\n\n“I know…,” he was still breathing heavily, “I’m… I’m very sorry for… keeping you… waiting… like… oh god, my legs,” he coughed and tried to adjust his breathing patterns, “I was caught up with—”\n\n“It’s fine. All that matters now is that you’re here.”\n\nShe seemed glad to just have him with her, and truth be told, he felt the same.\n\nA mistake, an excuse… those meaningless things went away the moment they locked eyes with one another. It felt like they could forgive and forget all about their mistakes just to be like this. There was them, and only them in their little world of theirs. They needed to look out and trust each other.\n\nNot one for savoring moments until the time was right, Lauren stepped away and looked at the window. And after enough time had passed for him to recover, Zachary stood up and joined her.\n\n“So where are we going?” He still wondered.\n\nShe had determined that she was to keep it all a secret till they reached their destination. However, it was too hard not to say anything. She could not avert his question. It was bizarre, but strangely comforting in her view.\n\n“...,” She let out a sigh of defeat, “I guess I’ll tell you. We’re heading off to the Old Pier.”\n\n“Th-The Old Pier?!” He gasped in shock but tried to hide it.\n\n「That place hasn’t been touched in years. It’s practically abandoned.」\n\n“I’ve been there a couple of times,” she held a genuine tone in her amiable voice, “You know there’s an amusement park there? And it’s still functional! Well, at least, most of it is… I think. There’s a Ferris wheel, a carousel, a Tilt-A-Whirl, uh… what else… Oh! And a rotor, can you believe it? It still looks old but it’s pretty impressive that it’s still hanging. Best of all, no one’s there, but I think you knew that already. It’s a perfect place for a moment of peace. It has all sorts of colorful and eye-opening stuff, that’s something we need as authors, don’t ya think?”\n\nHe laughed nervously, “I guess so…”\n\nBut in his mind, Zachary wondered if he could make a run for it and escape.\n\nThe Old Pier was infamous for being a subject of bad rumors and terrifying myths. There was not much that he knew about the place. All the little bits and pieces he heard about made him figure that the place was rundown. He could not also ignore the fact that the town hall had deemed that place off-limits to everyone in the town — he was shunned out in his own world but he wasn’t completely ignorant to what happened around him.\n\nAs much as he liked being with Lauren, he was not willing to give up on his life right then and there. He had had the impression that she was odd, and a little off the rails when it came to talking with him, but this was heading into “crazy” territory and he didn’t want to be there for it.\n\nMatter of fact was… this was not going to be an easy trip.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nEnter the light of sundown.\n\nThe Old Pier stood before the two youths in a surprisingly normal manner.\n\nThe place looked awfully fine, a bit rusty, but it still looked habitable — anything far from abandoned. It was mostly made of white, old concrete, as the actual pier of the place itself wasn’t till the very end, barely taking up a quarter of the area. There were several Cycladic buildings, painted with a shade of blue and white, settled at vertiginous heights, and flowed down inclined streets that were still built with concrete flooring. They were not associated with the amusement park, as they were placed on one side of the place, rather than blending with the rides, which served in their favor.\n\nThis town was known for a few of its beaches, but this place made it look more coastal than ever as if they were in another country altogether.\n\nZachary was shocked by the scene before him.\n\nIt was nothing like he had imagined. For a moment, he felt like a fool believing all those rumors and myths that ran about in town, when he usually hated rumors in the first place.\n\nYet deep inside, he felt… happy?\n\nPerhaps it was because he stopped being logical about his thoughts for a moment that it made him feel different… or he was simply captivated by the place. But it was more than likely the former, as he still saw nothing out of the place. He was shocked by the magnitude of the place, not its beauty.\n\nIn his eyes, it was as black and white as everything around him was.\n\n“Do you know why this pier is not being used anymore?” Lauren decided to break the silence.\n\nThey were standing in front of the place for more than five minutes, around the time they had gotten off the tram. Not a word was shared between them until now.\n\n“Honestly… no,” Zachary denied her question.\n\n“Then why did you seem scared of it when I mentioned it back there?”\n\nShe laughed, touching on the fact that she noticed his odd and fearful behavior throughout the whole ride. Her eyes were keen when it came to observation.\n\n“I just thought… I don’t know…,” He admitted his own fault.\n\n“That’s the power of the word of the mouth for ya. Can’t exactly do anything about it now, can we. Unless… we go back in time!” Her eyes sparkled, “But that’s impossible so we kinda have to live with this.” She giggled, sounding almost child-like.\n\nIt still piqued his curiosity how such a place was left alone in this fair state. There were not even signs of it being demolished. It was just left like that, never to be touched or approached. Like a place trapped in a time capsule.\n\n“Then why was it abandoned?” He asked.\n\nLauren, who was standing a little ahead of him, slightly turned her back and smirked, “Ghosts…”\n\nThe narrative has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the infringement.\n\n“...”\n\n「Huh?!!!」\n\nNot a single thing to do was going to hide the pale sight of shock on his face. It was as if all his blood was immediately drained out the moment he heard what Lauren had said: Ghosts.\n\nA sign of ghosts meant hauntings, hauntings meant danger, danger meant death, and death meant ghosts. It was all a loop—\n\nHad his mind been in the right place (as it usually should), he probably would have not been in such a dilemma as he was at the time.\n\n“H-Hold on now…!” He backed away with the look of shock still plastered on his face.\n\n“I’m kidding, I’m kidding,” she held his arms to calm him and pulled him a little toward her, “I was just making a joke. Ease up.”\n\nZachary was a little vexed by her antics, “The next time you make one, I’m legging it.”\n\n“Okay okay, I’m sorry! I’ll zip my mouth shut next time, alright?” She tried to hold in her laughter.\n\nLauren was amazed by his abundant fear of the paranormal. She never figured this apathetic boy that she had watched for over a year would quickly crumble away at the thought of hearing a myth being true. It almost brought a smile on her face, for a reason different than a simple reaction of laughter, that she saw a side of him no one else might have seen.\n\n“It became a private property after someone bought the location,” she turned her head back to the entrance of the pier as she explained, “Which helped the town back then build the new pier on the other side that we all know now. But then a few years after it was sold off, the owner just up and disappeared. No one thought of coming here anymore as it was still private property. So it kinda just became abandoned… and eventually the subject for silly rumors and myths.”\n\n「She certainly knows a lot about the town…」\n\nCuriosity, it was embedded within her. That alone earned her the knowledge not even most of the locals who have lived decades here knew about. This was a sign of great potential within her that Zachary could not simply comprehend. He strangely admired that about her.\n\n“That’s enough stories. Come on!” She laughed heartily.\n\nAfter that jovial conversation with him, she swiftly reached for his hand and grabbed it before dragging him into the pier.\n\nEven though it was Zachary’s first visit, it was Lauren’s eyes that were filled with ecstasy and color when they walked in. She would never get tired of this place, each visit felt like a new experience to her.\n\nThat was mainly because she learned how to take in all a moment’s worth.\n\n“Oh look at this one!”\n\nShe would occasionally gasp or drop a comment or two as they roamed the pier’s alleyways and took a look at every tiny detail that shined bright in her eyes. She was like a child who had just stumbled upon the world’s largest amusement park, which was no particular lie. Everyone had their odd interests.\n\nHers was just… abandoned theme parks? That was Zachary’s best guess.\n\nBecause they were all just decorations to him. Nothing noteworthy. This pier was less than fifty years old according to what he had heard. There was nothing amazing about it other than the fact that it was still “functioning” in some aspects.\n\nHe could not understand what she found so great with this place.\n\nYes, there was a certain amazing magnitude to it. But to him, it was as grim as everything in his world. Just what did she find so amusing?\n\nHuge alleyways. Decrepit rides. Plant-decorated and mold-infested buildings (most likely due to its growing age). Steep streets. That was all there was to it. All grand and hollow but nothing of real value, nothing to spark up a feeling.\n\nWatching the girl before him gape in awe brought him a bit of ease, with a somber reminder that he could not understand any of what she saw.\n\n“Soooo, what’s your favorite books?” Lauren asked all of a sudden.\n\nBefore he realized it, he was standing in front of a powered-down carousel.\n\nShe, on the other hand, was preoccupied on the side with what looked like a fuse box. It seemed that she was trying to bring this rundown old thing back to life.\n\n“Um… Are you sure you know how to work that thing?” He ignored her question as he was more concerned with her own well-being.\n\nShe chuckled, “It’s fine. My dad’s an electrical engineer, I’ve seen him working before and even helped on certain occasions,” she seemed proud with her statement, “Besides, I’ve done this a couple o' times. I turn it off each time I leave so it wouldn’t burn out. There’s only so much life a fifty-year-old machine can have.”\n\n“I see…,” He sighed.\n\nNoticing the tonal shift in his eyes to when he had entered the place, Lauren was starting to catch onto his thoughts. She wasn’t a psychic. He just did a poor job of hiding his dismay.\n\n“Am I boring you?” She nonchalantly asked.\n\n“Huh?! No, no,” he waved both his hands frantically in denial, “It’s just… I don’t get your enjoyment so much out of this stuff.”\n\n“Well, of course, you wouldn’t. What normal person would enjoy working a few cables and the like?”\n\n“No, it’s not about that. You just… looked amazed by everything around here. But I… I didn’t feel a thing.” He tried to get his point across. “I thought you were striving for that ‘world’ because you lacked it, but you seem to be doing just fine right now in my opinion.”\n\n“...” Lauren’s eyes widened upon hearing his words.\n\n「Shit! Did I say too much?」\n\nEven with that thought, he was as much shocked as her at how he was surprised by his bluntness. Normally, he wouldn’t give a damn about what he said.\n\n“You don’t see the fun in the small things, do you?” She blatantly asked.\n\n“What?!”\n\nHer voice wasn’t that of anger. The sound of her response didn’t seem like she was berating or mocking him as a payback for his words.\n\nIn fact, it was quite the opposite.\n\nShe felt sorrow. Her eyes told a similar story. It was as if she was a kid who looked at another and felt sorry for them for not experiencing the joy they felt.\n\n“You know what? I think I’ve had enough of these rides for today.” Her voice still maintained that warm tone.\n\nZachary felt like he had stepped on a landmine and it was only a matter of time before it was completely set off. Everything he had tried to work for in the past day seemed to crumble all of a sudden in front of him.\n\n“Wait, hold on, I—”\n\nHowever, Lauren immediately cut him off by placing her finger on his lips.\n\nThe trip wasn’t over yet.\n\n“Follow me, it’s time for the main event!”\n\nOnce again, she held onto his hand and dragged him around somewhere else while he looked as confused as ever.\n\nThere is more to this place than meets the eye.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“Are you… you sure about this?” Zachary could hear the fear in his voice.\n\n“It’s completely safe,” said Lauren, “I’ve only broken like two ribs.”\n\n“What?!!!”\n\n“I’m joking, I’m joking. Come on, hurry it up!”\n\nHe mumbled to himself. “(I thought I told you to stop making jokes that’d make my heart stop…)”\n\nFrom the outside, it was a simple lighthouse that matched the palette of all the other buildings. It stood at the top of a sandy hill; a hill which outlooked both the beach and the sea ahead. There was this unique aura of repose and odd nostalgia surrounding it.\n\nHowever, on the inside, which Zachary found himself at the moment, it was an entirely different story.\n\nIn terms of the interior walls, it looked as much as one would expect it to be according to its exterior.\n\nBut it was there that the feeling of tranquility disappeared.\n\nIt felt like they had stepped into an ancient tower rather than a lighthouse. There were a set of wooden stairs spiraling around the entire place up till the top. Not a single room lied in the middle. It was a straight shot through to the roof. The problem lied in the fact that the stairs were made of concrete, but most of them were broken off and replaced with wooden ones instead; that seemed to be much on the collapse as well.\n\n「I’d like to give the guy who reconstructed this a very big “Thank you” up the ass.」\n\nAlthough, the man who would have the brilliant idea of putting wooden stairs in an attempt to “fix” what was lost was probably some homeless man who lived here before. Zachary was sure they weren’t the only ones who stumbled on their own to this place. Who knew how many people had ventured here in the past half a century?\n\nDespite seeing Lauren run to the top in a carefree manner without facing any inconvenience, he was still hesitant on climbing the stairs. He could not guarantee his safety.\n\n「But am I really going to stop now?」\n\nBefore any second thoughts came to him, he mustered up his courage and…\n\n“Wait, I’m coming!”\n\n…he ran up the stairs.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nWhen he reached the top, Zachary felt like he stumbled onto a giant attic.\n\nThere was a faint touch of light seeping in through the round window in the center, and then some on the far right that seemed to be mostly blocked by a curtain of leaves hanging from the ceiling. Like the stairs that preceded it, the flooring of the place was made of mostly concrete, with a few wooden blocks recklessly placed here and there to fill any gap.\n\nIt felt like they were doing more harm than good as anyone could simply step on the wood and fall down. Perhaps it was his overthinking nature getting the best of him, but he could not afford to be not too careful now.\n\nContrary to the place’s dilapidated nature, there were a few dozen items and decorations placed around that seemed fairly new. They somehow brought a warm and cozy ambience to this rundown building — this room could very well pass as a treehouse.\n\nThere was still one thing that bothered Zachary.\n\n“Um… Lauren?!” He called out.\n\nThat playful girl was nowhere in sight. He was sure that she had climbed into this place as there was nowhere else to go on the way up but here.\n\nHe took a step forward before the floor beneath him loudly creaked and he backed away quickly.\n\n「I should probably watch where I’m stepping.」\n\nJust as he was walking backward…\n\n“Boo!”\n\nA loud voice echoed in his ears.\n\n“Woah!”\n\nHe quivered in his place for a second before frantically jumping away like a scaredy-cat. The whole process seemed almost comical and was definitely hilarious to watch… in Lauren’s eyes.\n\nShe was standing next to him, barely holding onto her legs as she was endlessly laughing at his over-the-top reaction. That boy gave off the best and most waggish reactions whenever he was frightened that she could not help but keep teasing him.\n\n“Do you get off from making people suffer?!!!” He said in his distraught state.\n\nThe question made it seem as if he finally crossed the line and decided to be as blunt as possible like he usually was before.\n\nAnd Lauren’s reaction was definitely an appropriate response.\n\nThere was a sudden look of shock in her eyes… before she returned back to laughing hysterically.\n\nInstead of a look of disgust or a slap in the face, he was just met with laughter. Normally, it would bother him to see someone seeing joy at his own misery. After realizing how ridiculous his reaction must have looked, he could not help but smile from Lauren’s infectious hysterics.\n\n“Do you get off from making people suffer…,” she leisurely shook her head as she recited his words while trying to ease her laughter, “Well um… a famous philosopher did once say, suffering leads to progress. So maybe that’s a good thing? For you?”\n\nZachary was surprised for a moment by her knowledge of philosophy, she almost sounded like an old man spouting nonsense in an attempt to give advice. He drove the thought away as he tried to focus back on the subject at hand.\n\n“That’s not exactly what he said,” he voiced his disagreement as he saw her walk by him, “And he was a… nihilist, you know.”\n\nShe turned her head back at him with a smile, “I mean, that’s on him. Why should you care? Besides, if you really wanna delve into it, I’d say he was an existentialist.”\n\nHe was slightly appalled by her behavior but he ultimately took it as a simple joke like everything she had done so far.\n\n“Here,” she walked over to the corner in the room with the wall covered by leaves, “Come over here and take a look!”\n\nTreading the floor carefully, he made sure not to step on any wooden palette that was in or out of his sight. He noticed some of the furniture and things that were placed in that corner.\n\nA few starfish necklaces nestled on top of a wooden nightstand. Beside the nightstand was a reasonably-sized worktable filled with tools, some old blueprints, what looked like a map placed at the front, and a couple of coins bundled together at the far edge of the table.\n\n“Are you sure your dad’s the only one into engineering or…?”\n\nRemembering when she mentioned helping her father with his work, Zachary randomly held a tool up to emphasize his point. He thought that perhaps the father’s work had passed down to the daughter. Although, if that were the case, it would strangely contradict her desire to be an author.\n\n“Oh no, those were up here when I first came to this place.” She elaborated, “Same as the furniture. I cleaned them all up and they made for some pretty comfy atmosphere for the place. The lighthouse keeper or whoever was in here before must have had a pretty acquired taste.”\n\nIf there was any era to describe the type of furniture present in that room, it would definitely be the Roaring Twenties. That brown color that painted every aspect of them was just too comforting for the eyes.\n\n“But we’re not here for these…,” she raised her finger like she had one more thing to show off, and judging from her words and the look of exhilaration in her eyes, it seemed to be most certainly true.\n\nLauren leaned and reached out her hand to grab a pole that was a little out of her grasp at first. She brushed off the leaves that were blocking the light and used all her might to completely push them out of sight with the pole. Behind where the leaves originally were, was a torn-up wall that perfectly overlooked the sea and the islands in the distance.\n\nIt was a wondrous view — at least to Lauren.\n\n“Look at this, it’s beautiful!” She gaped at the scenery with awe, “We came at the perfect time, don’t ya think?”\n\nHowever, Zachary did not think much of it. To him, it was just a view like any other. There was nothing of interest or special in it.\n\nLauren noticed that look of monotone in his eyes and could not help but sigh.\n\nWithout any warning, she grabbed onto his shoulders and pushed him directly in front of the scenery she was bewildered by.\n\n“Tell me,” she giggled from anticipation, “What do you see?”\n\n“Uh…,” he didn’t understand the question, “It looks like a bunch of islands to me? I think?”\n\n“Noooo, look at the scenery. Open your eyes!”\n\nHe wrinkled his eyebrows, “W-What do you mean “open my eyes”? They’re wide open!”\n\n“That’s not looking.”\n\n“Are you listening to yourself?” He turned his head in her direction.\n\nThese nonsensical words of hers painted her as one trying to indoctrinate him into a cult. As if the secret to happiness was within that cult. They’d tell you to just solve this one riddle and then make you doze off from their insanity till you force others to join through the same process.\n\nIt did not make an ounce of sense.\n\n“You wanna get ahead in life?” She started speaking like a life coach.\n\n“Um… I don’t know?”\n\n“Tsk,” she shook her head, “You wanna be an author?”\n\n“Uh… yeah?”\n\n“Do you want to see a bright-colored world?”\n\n“Yes!” His answers were affirmative.\n\n“Then listen to me, close your eyes, clear your mind, open 'em, and then look at the scenery!”\n\nThere was no choice but to follow along with her mystical scheme or whatever she had in mind.\n\nAnd so, Zachary closed his eyes.\n\n“That’s it…,” she uttered, “Now think about what you saw before. What was in the scenery?”\n\n“I… I don’t exactly remember. I didn’t focus that much.”\n\n“It’s alright. Even if it’s all vague, just try to picture something in your mind. A word, at least.”\n\nAll he thought of was the one word that described it. It was: nightfall.\n\n“You got it?”\n\n“I think…”\n\n“Okay, now open ‘em.”\n\nZachary opened his eyes. The scenery was still the same as ever, grim and completely devoid of color. Nothing had changed.\n\n“This is stupid,” He sighed and turned his head down in disappointment.\n\n“Hey hey, we’re not finished yet.” She put her hand under his chin and raised his head back up to face the view again, “Last step was looking at the scenery itself. Look at what’s in it. The details, everything that you can grasp. And then describe it to yourself.”\n\n“What are you—”\n\n“Just listen to me, pretty please.”\n\nA bit of that begging from her quickly refuted his urge to refuse.\n\nWithout any further delay, he turned his attention back to the view before him, staring only at the scenery, and solely that scenery. He tried to picture the right words to describe it whilst keeping his eyes open.\n\n“You’re allowed to blink, you know.” Lauren chuckled.\n\nIgnoring the feeling of embarrassment, he blinked and looked at the scenery once again.\n\nIt was a still scene of great islands in the ocean.\n\nNo matter how he went around through it, there was nothing more of note to it. If this was a matter of simply sightseeing to her, then he believed it was not the right one to fix his problem. Then again, he never did take the time to understand the purpose of sightseeing. His opinion on them was half-baked at best.\n\n「Alright, shut up and let me look. It’s just describing what I’m looking at. How hard can it be? I’m a writer. I’ve written several stories. I can do this.」\n\nHe tried to scrutinize it with care.\n\nThere was the amber luminescence of the sunset seeping through a plethora of gigantic clouds, which almost covered up the whole sky from above. The sunset sky was basking with twilight, radiating its light directly in the eyes of the onlooker. Looking at it at that moment, Zachary shut his eyes to shield himself from the light.\n\n「Ugh… This is too hard.」\n\nTo be fair, staring directly in the face of the sun with one’s eyes open was incredibly obnoxious. That’d be the case had it been the scorching sun of the morning. But this was simply the warm light of nightfall, and, as he realized behind his closed eyes, it barely brought any heat. He slowly opened his eyes back up and looked at the scene again. There was nothing wrong, he was still fine.\n\n「Stop worrying and start looking.」\n\nOther than the tree-filled islands in the distance, there was something that came to light the moment the ray of the sunset was recognized. There were mountains, several of them, way into the background. With the last hour of twilight on the horizon, the sun leisurely descended, shielding half of its appearance behind the farthest mountain, and illuminating it with an aura of romance. And with that same light, it shimmered down onto the ocean, posing a reflection that turned back onto the clouds.\n\nAnd there it was.\n\n“...?” Zachary tilted his head in confusion.\n\nOn the far left to the clouds, right above the giant burnt tree that almost blocked the view in the corner of his eye, was a strange illuminating shape of what looked like a bird.\n\nIt was the course of the moving clouds. They painted the illusion of a dove with great wings flying off in the distance, up to the free and boundless sky.\n\n「But what’s the point?」\n\nThis was nothing more than the beauty of nature and the wilderness during nightfall.\n\nThis was when he was hit with the answer.\n\n“Twilight in the wilderness…” He uttered these words under his breath as he gaped in astonishment over the revelation he came to.\n\nBefore he knew it, he had described nearly half of what the scenery before him had to offer. Most importantly of all, however, was that he cracked the secret to what it was all about.\n\nA scene “unhuman.”\n\nA simple scene of sublime nature.\n\n「Serenity…」\n\nBut this— this wasn’t the only thing that had changed in his perspective.\n\nThe scenery — the ocean, the mountain, and the light of sunset — were starting to shine brightly in his eyes. There was color in them.\n\nIt was as if a black and white image had transformed to one with selective color at a specific object of interest. A world deprived of color finally had a colored piece. It wasn’t the whole world, that much was true, but it was still something.\n\nIn its own twisted way, it was beautiful, offering quite the mesmerizing scene.\n\n“Earth to Mr. Ashworth!” A voice suddenly ringed in his ears. “Earth to Mr. Ashworth, are you there?”\n\nIt was Lauren. She was calling out to him this entire time yet he couldn’t hear a single thing. Entering this world of more color seemed to have taken quite the time off reality.\n\nZachary looked at her with the shock still in his eyes and then looked back at the painting. Its light and color were still there.\n\nWhen he woke up from that trance, he was still in this… new world.\n\nThis wasn’t something temporary, it was the next step to his dream, taken right at that moment. He couldn’t help but laugh after all this. All of this time he was searching for a part of an answer, and it was as simple as coming to appreciate a moment stopped in time.\n\nThat was the secret to the first path of an author: grasping the smaller picture.\n\nWith that knowledge, he figured out why Myung was the key to the full answer. Her stories were all about the bigger picture, with hidden meanings within. She understood it, but most of all (to do that), she understood the smaller picture first.\n\n“This is amazing!”\n\n“It’s breathtaking!” Lauren replied genuinely with similar joy, “Imagine what it would be like if we saw the whole world like that. If we came to appreciate all of it.”\n\nZachary came to understand her a little better with that discovery. She was astounded by this place because of all these varying objects of color within. It truly was a museum of art to her.\n\nTo test this newfound “ability” of his, he looked around for any visible color within the room. Sure enough, there were certain objects individually painted in vibrant colors. These were colors that were previously believed to be unimaginable in his eyes.\n\n“So this is why…,” Zachary chuckled, “This is why you run around like a child.”\n\n“Who are you calling a child?” Lauren pouted.\n\nShe crossed her arms and looked the other way in displeasure.\n\nIt didn’t take another second before she spoke again, “By the way, being a child is not so bad. Children have the widest imagination, as they say. And we need plenty of it right now.”\n\n“Whatever helps you sleep at night.”\n\n“Wow… okay,” she felt a sense of defeat knowing that he had gained the upper hand on her for once, “Anyway, come on, it’s time to move onto the next step.”\n\nShe walked farther into the room.\n\n“There’s more?”\n\n“You bet there is—” She held her tongue for a second before she counted a set amount of numbers on her fingers, “Well, it’s only this last part.”\n\nHer smile widened, turning into something mischievous.\n\nThis was the moment she was waiting for the most.",

Adding onto that jubilation was the nightfall scenery that lingered in place wherever they went.\n\nLauren would call for Zachary, urging him to keep up with her, every five seconds or so, she was really eager to show him this “last step.”\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\nAlthough with questions on his mind, Zachary asked her with a smile.\n\nIn his eyes, she still looked odd and crazy. But now he could not really see it as a bad thing, far from it. That sense of madness and passion blended together formed an infatuation so meticulous; it could only be seen as fantastic. If there was any other experience that replicated this free and mindless joy, it would have probably been the strange stimulants that every parent warned their children from. However, this feeling was more than that, this was incomparable.\n\nDozed off in his own daydream of thought, he woke up when he realized Lauren was no longer by his side.\n\n“Over here,” a voice came from over his head.\n\nThere she was, the girl of magnificent imagination, on top of the cupola, with joy still on her face. She had taken the ladder that was just near Zachary at the moment, and made it to the very top of the lighthouse.\n\nWhen he realized that the cupola was, and how it was a little steep for one’s foot to step on, Zachary began to worry. “Isn’t it a little dangerous?”\n\n“Eh, feels fine to me,” she leisurely walked around the cupola to show off. It felt as if she could lose her footing and fall at any moment, and yet nothing happened, “What do you think?”\n\n「I think I’m going to die.」\n\nHe swallowed the lump in his throat, mustered up what little courage he had, and held onto the ladder.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, he was up safely on the highest peak of the lighthouse, standing right beside Lauren. He tried to lean on the edge to see how the world looked from up here. They weren’t high up by a large margin, but it still had quite the effect on how wide the view down appeared.\n\n“What are we going to do?” He still had no idea why he was here.\n\nLauren snickered, “We’re going to shock our minds after all that rest.”\n\n「Rest?! But we barely got any.」\n\nUnless by that, she meant rest from school, then perhaps it was something to be considered as so. But then again, there wasn’t anything of note that happened at school that would make him feel particularly restless, including the errands he had to run. It wasn’t until he made it to this pier and had to traverse through it, like an adventure who knew nothing better but to risk his life at every second, that he felt fatigue building in both his mind and body.\n\nWhile he was off in his own world of overthinking, Lauren was already moving on with her plan.\n\nShe took off her school pullover and threw it on the side, unbuttoned the shirt that was underneath, and finally, she took off her shoes and socks. Now she was wearing nothing but a light tank top and her skirt. There was no need to take the rest off, she believed, as she wanted to shield herself from the cold breeze — although those two pieces won't exactly do the job.\n\nWhen Zachary turned to look at her after finishing his deep thoughts, his face reddened and he backed away in embarrassment. He did not take Lauren for someone who would casually take off most of her clothes in front of others, especially in front of a boy she had just met.\n\nBut even with his visible look of discomposure, Lauren took nothing of it.\n\n“W-What the hell are you… d-doing… like that?” He tried to keep his words together.\n\n“Taking a leap of faith!” She smiled.\n\nFollowing those words, she ran to the rear of the copula.\n\n“Try to keep up with me!!!”\n\nAnd then, she leapt forward and… jumped.\n\nShe jumped as high as one could, putting a good distance between her and the lighthouse. In an instant, she was gone from Zachary’s sight.\n\n“...!” He felt his heart stop and body freeze at that moment.\n\n*SPLASH*\n\nWhat followed after was the clamorous sound of impact against the ocean floor.\n\nIf his mind was in the right place, then Lauren had simply jumped off the lighthouse and dived into the ocean. This manner of thinking was not exactly “in the right place,” but if it were… that girl went beyond the definition of madness.\n\nHe carefully walked over to the rear where she had initially jumped. It took him a few seconds before he could get himself to look down and watch the scene before him. Even then, there was not much to see… because he had his eyes closed.\n\n“Come on down!”\n\nSuddenly, the cheerful voice of the girl, who almost led to his death several times, came back ringing in his ears.\n\nOpening his eyes, he saw Lauren’s small figure floating on top of the water. She was completely fine. No scratches. No broken legs. Nothing of note that would make her scream in pain.\n\n“Come on, get down here,” she called out once again.\n\n“Can’t I just get down… the normal way?!” He replied back.\n\nShe shook her head. “It’s part of the experience, you have to jump!”\n\n“Are you mad?!\" He snapped, almost slipping off the cupola in the process from his movement before he quickly picked himself back up, “There’s no way in hell I’m making that jump?”\n\n“You made it all the way up, so why stop now? Jump!”\n\n“But…”\n\nHe thought about it for a moment. This whole situation, all the weird things that have been happening to him, they all brought him joy. He felt it before, and he felt it again now. It was no illusion. He was so caught up with his safety and what was around him that he hadn’t realized until now. That was genuine joy beating in his heart this entire time.\n\nLauren was amazing. She had brought excitement into his mundane life.\n\nAnd yet—\n\n「I don’t want to jump.」\n\nLooking at the sea again from this height almost brought him nausea. He hadn’t been to many high places, so of course, he would be completely ignorant to the fact that he feared heights.\n\n「Don’t think about it!」\n\nHe stepped back with his eyes closed…\n\n「Don’t think about it! Don’t think about it! Don’t think about it! Don’t think about it! Don’t think about it! Don’t think about it! I have to change! I’m allowed to dream!」\n\n…and took a leap of faith.\n\n…\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was in the air. The wind was rushing incredibly against his body. He felt he was being pulled into the water at immense speed, like a picture that suddenly grew larger and more detailed.\n\nBefore he knew it, he dropped in the ocean.\n\nUnder this ocean, the water was rushing at his body from every direction possible. It was harder to move. Everything felt slower as if the moment had completely stopped in time\n\n“...!”\n\nFor some reason… he could not swim back to the surface. His body had halted every possible system that aided his movement.\n\nAnd into the darkness, he went.\n\nThe deep, deep darkness of the beyond.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nThere was nothing at all.\n\nNo sound.\n\nNo feeling.\n\nComplete isolation from the world, a world that was slowly fading away from sight, a world consumed by darkness.\n\nEverything was engulfed in darkness, not a single distinctive object was in sight, everything looked and felt the same.\n\nNothing.\n\nDark and empty.\n\nNo sight or sound.\n\nThis was a fate worse than death.\n\n「Where…?」\n\nZachary tried to speak his thoughts, but nothing would come out.\n\nWhere was the ocean? Where were the islands? Where were the mountains? Where was the sky? Where was the Old Pier?\n\nWhere was anything?\n\nWhere was that feeling of jubilation? Where was that world that was so close to being bright-colored? Where was it?\n\nWhere was Lauren?\n\nConfused by his current predicament, he stood up. He had regained control of his body, and yet he didn’t feel quite there like he was floating somehow. It felt as if he was in someone else’s as if this was a mere dream.\n\nIf he was dead, then surely he wouldn’t be greeted by this void. That was what he believed at least.\n\nBut no, this wasn’t death.\n\nIt wasn’t because he knew, and more so because he had a feeling. Even in that void, he was able to conjure a feeling. It was a feeling of unrest, but it was a feeling nonetheless.\n\nNot set on leaving himself like this, he walked.\n\nHe walked for seconds, minutes, hours, or maybe days. Who knew?\n\nThere was no sense of time here. Just the purpose of moving.\n\nBefore he realized it, the void around him had shifted entirely to a small and narrow hallway in what seemed like a small apartment. Even with this change, he pressed onward to the end. This apartment was not strange to his eyes.\n\nHe remembered it.\n\nA muffled masculine voice echoed throughout the hallway, yet it was still clear enough to be heard.\n\nZachary still walked, not showing any sign of stopping until he reached that door, the door at the end of the hallway, the source of the voices. Step after step, he moved in an unruly manner, having no real control over his legs, as if he was just a child learning how to walk, or a drunk who could barely tell his head from toe. Even the world around him began to levitate upwards as if he lost the height of his legs.\n\nYet he continued on like nothing was wrong, only following his curiosity.\n\nAnother voice emerged, this time a feminine one that seemed too weak and kind to be in such a situation. It seemed like the two were arguing against each other for someone that was not there at that time.\n\nThe argument went on.\n\nThe voices grew louder.\n\nIt wasn’t stopping. With every word the man uttered, Zachary felt his heart ache, but he felt it, even more, when the woman tried to fight back despite her weakness.\n\nAll of this felt too familiar.\n\nBefore he knew it, he was already standing in front of the door with his hand at the knob — which was quite the length away from him, but he managed to stand on his toes and reach for it.\n\nThe voices stopped.\n\nHe gripped the knob tightly.\n\nShould he open the door? He wondered.\n\nIt wasn’t a matter of “should” more than it was a matter of “could.” For all he knew, this was a bizarre world that could pull anything at any moment.\n\n「No!」\n\nHe had already decided before. He was going to move forward without fail, even if it meant facing the unthinkable.\n\nUnauthorized tale usage: if you spot this story on Amazon, report the violation.\n\nAnd so, he twisted the knob and pushed the door forward with all his might.\n\nEverything felt noticeably heavier than before for some reason. There was no sound of the door creaking or any pressure coming from the room that closed.\n\nThere was only one thing present inside the room.\n\nAn unforgettable sight.\n\nLooking from down to up, Zachary carefully watched the scene before him in horror.\n\nThe blood dripping from the feet, the legs floating in the air, the body that was too limp to be alive, and the neck that was tied to the noose.\n\nSomeone had hung themselves up.\n\nTheir face was devoid of life… yet it stared down at him with shock.\n\n“GAH!!!”\n\nZachary screamed as he fell to the ground on his back.\n\nHe looked back at the dreadful sight of the corpse, his shaking hands and arms could not support him well to have a good look. He did not want to face that sight. He could hear the sound of his voice shaking as his breathing got heavier.\n\nIn all his rush and panic, he stood up and ran away…\n\n…never to look back on that sight…\n\n…locking it away from his mind.\n\nHe ran and ran in the endless void.\n\n「Get me out of here!」\n\nHe did not care.\n\n「Get me out of here!」\n\nHe just wanted to run away as quickly as possible.\n\n「Get me out of here!」\n\nThere was nothing after all — at least, that was what he believed.\n\n“Someone get me out of here!!!” Zachary shouted.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n“Zach!”\n\nA sound echoed in his right ear, a familiar feminine voice.\n\nBut where was he? How could he reach it?\n\nBefore he could answer this question, he felt the weight of something creeping under his armpits, before his body was slowly lifted up. It felt as if someone was pulling him away. An immense pressure broke down on him, yet his body effortlessly pushed against it.\n\nHe felt rather lethargic. The void was fading away from his sight.\n\nThat was when it clicked with him.\n\nIt was still not over.\n\n「...yes...」\n\nHe was not alone this time.\n\nHe had her.\n\nAnd so ended the nightmare of a memory.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nDeep from the seabed and up to the ocean floor in a matter of seconds, Lauren pulled Zachary out of the water.\n\nShe could not understand why this had happened.\n\nOne moment, Zachary was diving into the water in front of her, and in the next, he did not come back. For a second, she thought he was joking around, but then a second passed, and then the next, and the next… no sign of him, he was just not swimming back.\n\nThere was only one conclusion: drowning.\n\nWhen she came to that realization, she almost froze before she thought of acting quickly to save him.\n\nAnd just so it happened, she was now carrying his body and pulling him out of the ocean after he had drowned.\n\nThankfully, they were close to the beach right beside the docks, which served as a safe place to reach for now, and a place they could head back up from.\n\n「We were just having fun. Why did it come to this?」\n\nSimply put, she did not account for the other person that was with her. All she cared about was showing off everything that she had experienced and was capable of. It wasn’t to that extent of self-absorption. There was still goodwill in her actions, she merely wanted to share her secret source of joy and passion with someone else and recklessly thought they’d feel the same.\n\n「But he was smiling… he looked happy. Was I too forceful?」\n\nNothing of what she thought mattered now. She had to save Zachary.\n\nWalking up to the shore, she placed Zachary on the sand before lying on her knees next to him. She tried her hardest to think of how to save him.\n\nShe knew nothing whatsoever about CPR. There was, of course, the option of running with him to the nearest hospital. But she wasn't going to make it on time considering they were off at the edge of town.\n\n「You gotta do something, Lauren.」\n\nJust as she was about to place her hands on his chest…\n\nHis eyes suddenly opened. Following that were a couple of coughs that spilled out the water trapped inside him. He breathed heavily after recovering as he tried to grasp the world around him.\n\nZachary was back in the world of the living.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“Oh thank god!” Lauren gasped in relief, “Are you okay? Can you see me? What happened down there? Why did you jump if you didn't know how to swim? Why didn’t you stop me? How could you let yourself drown there?”\n\nEven after escaping the brink of death, there was no escaping the questions. However, the plethora of questions this time were coming from the girl he never expected to see with a panic-stricken face. It was obvious how bad she was in her panicked state. Most of her questions didn’t make sense and were unreasonable to ask.\n\nComing back to his senses, Zachary noticed that Lauren had both her hands tightly gripping his arms as if she was trying to hold him from running away.\n\nHer eyes were filled to the brim with worry. There was sweat dripping from her side (or maybe it was just from the water). If what he had experienced was just a hallucination, then what could have happened to him in the real world? Whatever happened to him, it must have worried her a great ton.\n\n“What…” He tried speaking.\n\nAfter seeing him gradually returning back to consciousness, she shook her head in an attempt to ease her worry.\n\n“Hey hey, it’s me. Don’t worry…,” her voice was soothing.\n\nSolace gradually seeped into his mind, putting him at rest.\n\nIt was as if he was a lost child who was reunited with his parents after some time. In this case, it was a hopeless idiot pulled back into reality by the only one who believed in him, a girl that he had just met the other day, yet felt like he had known her for decades.\n\n“Why…,” her voice still had bizarre cracks in the tone, “What happened to you?”\n\nZachary remembered what happened clearly. But he didn’t want to worry her even more with something that wouldn’t make sense to her.\n\nHe tried to laugh it off, “Hey… I was just… taking it all in… like you said before.”\n\nHearing that awful attempt at a sense of humor eased her distress and made her almost laugh for a second — which was exactly what he intended — but her eyes were still struck with fret.\n\n「Was she… crying?」\n\nBefore he could dwell on that thought further, she replied to his joke.\n\n“I don’t… I don’t think that same method applies here,” she chuckled.\n\n“I guess not… Wanna see me try again?”\n\n“Oh shut up, this is nothing to joke about.”\n\nLauren was irritated by the fact that he was smiling so casually. Yet, she let a chuckle escape her breath. She was laughing about this entire scene. A worrisome idiot tending to a careless idiot that she had just met the other day, both alone on that dusk-coated beach. It was a fact that they both believed: they were idiots.\n\nShe sighed, “I have a feeling this partnership of ours is going to be quite troublesome.”\n\nHe coughed two times instead of laughing, before clearing his throat to answer her properly. “You don’t say.”\n\nAnd just like that, the two were enveloped within a world of their own.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“If this isn’t an omen, I don’t know what is.”\n\n“It’s called being an idiot.” Lauren tried to reassure Zachary.\n\nDespite all the hesitation and thought he was at that moment, he realized that he had still jumped off the lighthouse and into the water fully clothed.\n\n“Perhaps I was too reckless.”\n\n“That’s one way to look at it.” Lauren tried to mock him, “Perhaps you should carefully look things over before doing something.”\n\n“Really? And what if I fa~~” He lowered his head as if he were going to drop dead on the ground.\n\n“No!” She reached for his shoulders to pull him back up, “Don’t sleep now!”\n\n“But I wanna sleep so bad, come on,” he spoke like a nagging child. He could stomp his legs on the ground and it wouldn’t feel odd with the manner he spoke in.\n\nLauren sighed, “So you do have a fun side… at awful times. Come on, we should get you home now.”\n\n“Oh, we’re here actually!”\n\nAfter a few encounters with the military police patrolling the town (to ensure that everyone was acting accordingly), the two rascals were out of the main streets and into neighborhood side streets, away from all the ruckus.\n\nOn their left was a metal gate that reached up to almost a two-story building, preceding it was a long path of immaculate concrete tiles surrounded by fields of grass with the lightest color on both sides — the rest was barely visible due to how long the path was. Beyond the trees and fields, a mansion sprung up from afar.\n\n“Oh wow,” Lauren was surprised, “I didn’t know you lived near a mansion like this! Must feel bad living so close to your drea—”\n\nZachary passed her and went right in the direction of the mansion itself. It didn’t take long before he approached the gate and pushed it open with ease.\n\n“Wait wait wait wait— You live here?!!” She shouted with surprise.\n\nShe moved backward in shock while staring at the mansion in all of its entirety. Its sight was something to behold. The number of windows plastered on its front was endless, it was almost close to being a glass house — talk about privacy for a ‘private’ mansion. Despite the archaic feel to it (like everything in that town), it was rather clean in its presentation with white paint coating its entirety. It could potentially pass off as a modern mansion with an old gothic decoration when in reality, it was over a hundred years old.\n\nA revelation of this magnitude left Lauren in utter awe. She looked at Zachary after getting her fill of the mansion’s image.\n\nEven though he had seen her react in shock, he could feel a moment of scolding rising up.\n\n“You’re mad, aren’t you?” He chuckled nervously as he rubbed the back of his head.\n\n“Of course I’m mad!” She stomped her feet on the ground like a child throwing a tantrum. “You’re living the high life—”\n\n“It’s not all what it looks like… Just flare and no color.” He spoke before she could go on. He still bore his apologetic expression yet he wanted to make it clear what type of colorless life he had been led to in this place. He wanted to vent out all the problems he had with this “home,” however… “Besides, we’ve only just met.”\n\n“Excuses, excuses,” she closed her eyes and waved her arm around in rejection as she approached him, “I don’t want any of that, Mister. That should have been the first thing you said when we first met.”\n\nHe raised an eyebrow and thought for a moment. “What? Should I have just said “Hey, I’m rich and I live in a huge mansion that could rival Dracula’s” or something like that?”\n\nAll of a sudden, Lauren sprung up on her feet, grabbed Zachary’s hand, and held them both up before closing some of the distance between him and her.\n\nHer face lit up with excitement like never before, “I’d marry you on the spot!”\n\nThose words left him shocked and speechless.\n\nFor all the bizarre things happening that day, he felt a slight ache in his heart. Seeing Lauren’s face and hearing her words only deepened that ache within him. Why? He would wonder. Because those simple words would make anyone flutter in fantasy. Right about now, he should be dreaming in his little cloud bubble about their wedding together — a fantasy fit for the gullible. But he knew better.\n\n“But leave out the Dracula part,” she let go of his hands as she turned away.\n\nHe chuckled, hiding his dismay. “I knew you’d say that.”\n\n“Yeah, nothing could beat Dracula’s castle if we’re being honest.” She rushed back to Zachary with a, once again, exciting look. “I mean, have you seen it, man? It could very much be a castle and a tower… and it moves!!!”\n\nThis was all just a jestering matter.\n\n「Of course she was only joking.」\n\nBut after confirming for himself, he felt the ache in his heart slightly fade away. And truth be told, he did not want anything else. He was glad to be able to have a friend to joke with. It was a dream come true, and a step in the right direction.\n\n“By the way,” He tried to distract his thoughts, “What were you going to show me back in the ocean? The thing about freshening up our minds.”\n\nLauren thought for a second before it hit her, “Oh? It was this!”\n\nShe reached for her bag and pulled out a large cold coin to show off to Zachary.\n\n“A coin… golden coin?” He did not get her enthusiasm, “That’s what I almost drowned for? And you had it with you this entire time?”\n\n“N-No, there was more down in the sea, a-and I didn’t you were gonna…,” she stopped when she finally remembered the purpose of this coin, “This is not just any coin. It’s a Grail Coin.”\n\nInstead of replying back to her, he felt lost. He had no idea what she was talking about. It left him with an unfocused gaze of confusion.\n\n“Well, they say,” she started explaining the story, “In the past, there was a race across the globe for obtaining the legendary “Holy Grail.” The participants were divided into factions with their own allies. It was said that those who got ahold of its coins were closer to the prize than most. But it wasn’t just any type of Grail Coins, they were supposed to be coins that aligned with their factions. This one bears the sigil of the Hanged Man.”\n\nShe quickly held the coin right in front of Zachary’s eyes to show its details.\n\nThe coin was certainly bigger than any coin he had ever seen before.\n\nIt was rusty, most likely from being under the ocean for who knew how long. There was a certain symbol crafted on it, which seemed like a man drawn upside down. Of course, one could always rotate it to make it look upright, but what distinguished that the intended symbol was upside down was the rope at the end of the man’s leg. It was indeed… a hanged man.\n\n“I hear that it fetches a high price on the market,” she smiled wryly.\n\nZachary tried to grasp what he was hearing, “You dragged me through all that trouble for treasure hunting?”\n\n“Nooooo I would never,” the way she had said it made it hard to believe, “Now, open up your hand.”\n\nHe complied with her command.\n\nShe placed the gold coin on top of his palm, “Close your eyes.”\n\n「This again?」\n\nJust as before, he shut his eyes.\n\n“Now put your other palm on this one.”\n\nEven though he realized the beauty of such things, he still lacked enthusiasm when it came to the first-time process. Nevertheless, he listened to Lauren’s request.\n\n“Can you feel it?”\n\n“F-Feel what? The coin?”\n\n“Yes. What else?”\n\n“I guess so…”\n\nHe was holding it after all. Not feeling the coin on his hand would mean that he could not feel his hand altogether.\n\n“Take all its features in like you did before without looking. Just touching.”\n\nWith the coin tightly in his full grasp, he rubbed both his hands against each other, getting himself to “feel” the coin that was in-between in the process.\n\nAt first, he felt the inscriptions on the coin, there were some that seemed missing, seeing as there were sharp gaps in the middle. Since there was barely anything at this “small” coin, compared to the scenery he had to look at earlier that day, he was already feeling the sigil at the center. It was neatly carved, vastly different from the inscriptions, but then something seemed to be missing as well, or rather… it was carved deeper than the rest of the body.\n\nCurious about that last detail, Zachary opened his eyes and palm before taking a good look at the coin. It was the leg wrapped with a rope. Now that he was directly looking at it, he narrowed his eyes to focus.\n\n「A button?」\n\n“And that’s another test done.” Lauren clapped her hands.\n\nZachary flinched for a second.\n\nHe had almost forgotten that Lauren was here with him. Perhaps that was one of the points she tried to show him: to be completely engrossed in something.\n\n“Writing isn’t just describing visuals… it’s everything.” She spoke with that same tone of passion she had when they first met, “An imagination needs to be erratic, chaotic, with terrifying and boundless freedom to conceive something.”\n\n“Is that why you were always so quick with everything today?”\n\nShe thought for a moment and then laughed, “Sure, let’s go with that.”\n\nBoth of them were laughing, but now the tone of their voices lacked that energy and enthusiasm of earlier, it possessed a somber tone. Because they knew, with everything they had done today and with the evening itching closer, it was time for farewell.\n\n“Uh… hey.”\n\n“Hey…”\n\nThey spoke at the same time. But they weren’t surprised. They still had things to say, yet they were left gazing at each other.\n\n「Maybe…」\n\nSince they were already near his house…\n\n「Maybe…」\n\nZachary moved closer to Lauren, but she instinctively turned back.\n\n“Oh!” He realized his mistake and returned to his position, “I thought maybe you’d want to enter the mansion. We could talk about our stories too, I don’t know much about yours. Maybe we could give each other tips.”\n\n“Oh no, it’s getting late, and I’d hate to impose.” Lauren gave off an awkward smile and rubbed the back of her head, “B-Besides, we shouldn’t be so eager like this,” her voice turned back to the usual tone, and then she placed her finger on her lips, “We should keep them a secret till after the competition.”\n\nHe couldn’t quite understand her reasoning, but he went along with it.\n\n“But we didn’t even submit anything yet.”\n\n“Oh we will,” she winked, “You better get ready for the weekend, it’s the deadline for submissions. And we’re meeting Myung if you haven’t forgotten.”\n\n「That’s right!」\n\nIt felt as if Zachary was hit with a reality check. This one day of wonders had caused him to drift off far away from his dream than intended.\n\nBut now, he was reminded of his priorities, and with a new perspective at that.\n\nAnd then he remembered that his story was quite gloomy, all things considered. It was never going to be a perfect fit with how his thoughts were now. However, he did not feel like he was in peril. Instead, he had never felt such a surge of confidence overwhelm him like that before.\n\nHe was going to make a new story.\n\nWith a few days left till the meeting with Myung and one chance to submit, he was going to write something new. It was going to be challenging. But he was still going to write it. He had to prove his worth as an author. He was going to gain Myung’s recognition. He had to, after all. He had a dream to fulfill.\n\n“You look pretty excited all of a sudden,” Lauren smirked.\n\nHe remembered her part in all of this, and he could not be more thankful for meeting her and opening up his world.\n\n「We have a dream to fulfill.」\n\n“I mean, who wouldn’t? We’re meeting Myung. We have to be in tip-top shape no matter what. You better be ready, Lauren.” He raised his arm and pointed his finger to the sky, “We’re going to change the world!”\n\nLauren was surprised by his bizarre pose but ultimately found it endearing, causing her to let out a warm chuckle. It was clear that her influence had rubbed off on him a little too much, yet it all came as a benefit in the end.\n\n“We’re meeting Myung! We’re going to change the world!” She stretched both her arms to the front, joining in on Zachary with the weird poses.\n\nThey just needed a few more people with them, to wear colorful space armor made of spandex, and their act would be officially complete.\n\nAfter raising their spirits up, they waved back at each other with a smile as Lauren walked down the street. The scene looked awfully familiar to the one from the day before, except instead of being left with confusion and gloom, Zachary was now confident in himself.\n\nHe was going to write that story.\n\nHe was going to join the competition.\n\nHe was going to meet his idol.\n\nHe was going to meet Myung.",

There was no way; no possible way this could have happened. It all felt like one giant sick joke that would leave a bitter taste in his mouth forever— no, an ache in his heart that would turn into a scar, never to be healed.\n\nBut what was this agonizing episode?\n\n「What was I…」\n\nZachary’s mind was in a clutter. Suddenly plunging into this state of shock had him feeling lost as if he had just dropped into the scene without having any idea where his left or right was.\n\nHe racked his brain, recalled his thoughts, and counted every step he had taken prior to this occurrence.\n\nJust a few days ago, he had started writing his new story, completely scrapping the old one and quickly moving on. He remembered; how fresh his mind was at the time as ideas flooded his head and the words just wrote themselves; how he felt exhilaration with every mere sentence that he finished. It was unprecedented, a completely foreign emotion to him.\n\nBefore long, a day before the deadline, he finished it. For once in his life, he had finished a written work by himself in a matter of days. It might have been a short story, but it was something.\n\nIt meant progress.\n\nThe long-awaited day arrived.\n\nHe had accompanied Lauren to the convention that held the writing competition just as promised. They were filled with determination and confidence about their individual work. However, both of them were there for one other reason of more importance. They were meeting their favorite author, Hye-mi Myung.\n\nAnd so that brought him here, right at this moment.\n\nHe was supposed to be meeting Myung, the woman that he strived to be like one day. He wanted to know what this idol, who had remained faceless to him this entire, looked like. He wanted to know what she was like in the real world and to see what she saw.\n\nOne problem lied in his path…\n\n「Where is she?」\n\nRather than being a matter of where… it was why.\n\nIf reality functioned the way it was supposed to, the actual person that was ‘Hye-mi Myung,’ was standing right in front of him, greeting several fans that came her way like nothing was wrong.\n\nAnd he knew that; he knew that very well.\n\nBecause he stepped into this wide convention hall by himself, fully aware of his surroundings with not a single bizarre noise to be heard, and walked over to the stall Myung was supposed to be at.\n\nShe was there… until she wasn’t.\n\nThere was only noise.\n\nUnspeakable noise clogged his ears in just a few seconds. Myung’s entire face was wiped from his sight, or rather, it was sealed by noise; noise enough to form scribbles. It felt as if a child took a photo of her and completely crossed her face out with a black marker. Her words came out in whispers instead of actual words or even incoherent gibberish, and yet her voice was barely audible to be able to distinguish a single thing out of her words.\n\nThis was feeling all too familiar to Zachary, reminding him of the world he had lived in before he was pushed into a wishful dream.\n\n「No… no… no…」\n\nWhen he desired to stop listening to the useless chatter, to everyone and everything that annoyed him, he would shun them all out and throw himself into this world of noise. This was how somber he was in the past.\n\nHowever, things were different now. They were supposed to be different.\n\nHe did not put himself through a whirlpool of self-discovery and desire that past week just so things would remain the same.\n\n「Why now of all times? Just why?」\n\nIt made not a single shred of sense. He desired to hear the words of Myung. He wanted to see her. He wanted to listen to her. Not too long ago, he was listening to her talk through the radio, so that desire to listen was within him from even before his meeting with Lauren.\n\n「Oh, Lauren!」\n\nCrawling with shock and desperation, he turned to his left, to look at Lauren.\n\n“It’s really a great honor to meet you—”\n\nHer voice was clear. The look of ecstasy on her face was even visible. She was naturally talking with who was supposed to be Myung. Everything seemed fine with her. Her side of the conversation with Myung was audible, while Myung’s side was nothing but whispers.\n\n「Why?」\n\nWhy could he only hear her voice? He did not know.\n\n“Zach?” Lauren’s voice echoed in his ears.\n\nHe raised his head quickly and looked at her.\n\nThe entirety of the time he was falling down a world of his own creation in his mind, she was swept up with her conversation with Myung. Her enthusiasm totally blinded her from tending to Zachary till it was over. She hadn’t the faintest idea what was wrong with him. She eyed him a puzzled gaze, before turning her eyes to the right, and gesturing for him to look at his right.\n\nHe turned… then, he realized… it was his turn to talk.\n\nMyung was looking at him… or at least seemed to be. Even with that, it didn’t change the fact that he could not see nor hear her. She was simply noise manifested into reality in front of him.\n\nShe talked… but only whispers were heard.\n\n“(I can’t…)” He tried his damndest to mouth something.\n\nBut the world around him was thrust into an endless spin.\n\nHis breathing became ragged. He felt a sense of nausea swelling up within him.\n\n“(I…)”\n\nThis was supposed to be a moment of rejoicing, a moment that would elevate him to the next step and continue his path. A twisted joke, that was all it had become. It was the will of fate downplaying his effort and desire to a joke as he had thought initially.\n\nAnd there was nothing he could do.\n\n“...”\n\nNothing he could do but… scream.\n\n“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!”\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nAfter a horrifying scream that nearly terrified everyone in the hall, Zachary stood out in the alleyway to the building. Still quivering from the shock of the incident, he swung his fist into the brick wall. Again and again, he kept on punching the wall and withheld the pain by letting grunts escape his breath until blood seeped out of his knuckles.\n\n“Gh…,” he struck again, “GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!”\n\nHe wasn’t scared, confused nor sad. His heart was seething with hatred for himself. He was the one that once forced himself into the world of noise, and when he desired to get away, his subconscious worked against him. It was all ultimately him. He was angry, and this was the only way he could vent it out.\n\n“I tried!” He shouted at the top of his lungs, “I tried damn it!!! I was only just a scrawny kid who knew nothing about his well-being. I used to be scared to dream, to want to change. It’s scary, you know — to be someone you were not before. But then you gave me the chance to change, you showed me what it was like to see normality, to strive for it… and I worked really hard. I wanted to listen, I wanted to see, I wanted to know what this world really looks like!!!!”\n\nJust outside the alleyway, Lauren stood watching him with a look of sympathy on her woeful face.\n\nShe listened to his weary and sorrowful voice as he spoke out his thoughts. Despite finally getting the chance to visit the event she waited for so long, she left it for him. If there was anything else she desired more than her goal, it was to help and be there for her friends, especially this friend in particular.\n\nThere was a great distance between him and her. Each time she would take a step to approach him, he would punch the wall and she would back up out of instinctive fear. She wanted to help him, but his behavior was too erratic and dangerous for her safety.\n\n“But even after everything!!!” He yelled and slammed his fist into the wall one last time, “After seeing, learning, and writing — over and over. Nothing’s changed… I still couldn’t listen…” His throat had grown sore from the constant yelling and his voice became tired that he was barely able to utter the last sentence.\n\nFed up with her inability to move, Lauren jumped off her feet and caught his fist before it hit the wall again. Her eyes lit with the life of sorrow, she gazed at him for as long as she could.\n\n“That’s enough…,” she said, “You’ll break your hand. Please, stop.”\n\nStolen content alert: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.\n\nHer voice, which was snuffed out from the bright affability it always possessed, still sounded soothing enough to calm his mind. No matter what happened, her voice would somehow manage to find a way to pull him back to reality.\n\nRegaining some of his composure, he loosened his grip, but Lauren still wouldn’t let go of his hand. She still held it with all her might.\n\nThis girl, whom he had just met a week ago, and who knew nothing about what was troubling him at this moment, still came to his aid. To anyone who witnessed his behavior, they would have immediately perceived him as insane. But for her, it was natural to hold onto him.\n\n“(I couldn’t hear her…)”\n\nIn spite of his broken voice, she was able to listen to him this time. She was still puzzled about what his words meant. All she knew and believed was that he was scared and suffering. She saw how frightened he was the moment he met Myung. Something else was obviously going on that she lacked the context for, but she needn’t pry. There was no need for her to know what was going on to realize that he was wrecked with grief.\n\nZachary wanted to appreciate her support and thoughtfulness, but…\n\n「It’s over.」\n\nHe did not care.\n\nWith that thought overtaking him, he crumpled to the ground and leaned by the wall. Lauren still held onto his hand, she tried her best to understand his situation to help him. But he didn’t care for that anymore.\n\nEverything he had strived for was reduced to nothing the moment the noise came back. It revealed how stupidly ignorant it was to think he could change. There was no meaning to anything that he did. Nothing had meaning, not even the day he believed he had changed; the day he believed had opened his eyes. It was all—\n\n“It’s all for nothing…,” he muttered under his breath.\n\nSuddenly, Lauren shouted, “That’s not true!”\n\nThe tone of her voice bore no warmth. It was loud and seemed to emit a tone of disappointment. Her face told a similar story, she was clearly maddened by his words. Her eyes were filled with resolve.\n\nShe looked just determined enough to not give up on him. And there was no getting to him unless she told him what needed to be said.\n\n“Listen,” she started, “I don’t know what happened back there. I don’t know what’s wrong with you. But I am not gonna let you crumble in some alleyway and throw everything away!” She kneeled down and faced Zachary directly, “It’s not over yet. Just because you stumbled in the road, doesn’t mean you can’t keep going.”\n\n“Lauren, I—”\n\n“I’m not done yet!” She interrupted, “No one reaches their dream from just one go. They keep trying. Chase your dreams. Even if there’s an immovable blockade, you’ll find a way to break it. You’ll get there someday. Besides, you’re not alone.” She reached for his hands and held both her hands with his in the center between them, to show the significance of their bond, “We made a promise! We are in this together, and we’ll help each other, till the end of the road. And nobody is gonna stop us. Not Myung. Not anyone. We’re working for ourselves, for our dreams. You ruined your chance with the meeting, so what? It doesn’t devalue the worth of your goals. So you better get up and move if you still want to see that bright-colored world.”\n\nZachary grit his teeth.\n\n「She’s right…」\n\nIt wasn’t over.\n\nWhile the incident with Myung had left a bitter taste in his mouth, there was still the matter of his own work and dream. Myung and his story in the competition were completely separate things. She wasn’t going to be the one that would grant his dream for him. There wasn’t anyone who would do such a thing besides him. He had to continue toward granting his own dream — sulking around wasn’t going to do anything.\n\nLauren’s words had somehow dragged him out of the pit he had recklessly thrown himself into, yet it wasn’t all that surprising. In fact, he felt comfortable knowing that she could really help him in his time of need.\n\nHe tilted his head upwards, looking directly at Lauren.\n\nShe still looked mad, but her expression seemed to have softened a little, making it almost look endearing.\n\n“You know…,” he said, “You really suck at giving a motivational speech.”\n\n“W-Whaa…?! I-I wasn’t trying to—” She backed away and turned her face in the other direction, hiding her expression from his view. But she could not hide her ears, which were burning with embarrassment.\n\n「She’s… blushing?! Certainly did not expect that from her.」\n\n“It is… a joke!” He tried to correct what his poor sense of humor had caused.\n\n“Well, whatever, it’s my fault for trying to help you.” She spoke in a condescending tone, with her face still in the other direction.\n\nHer behavior seemed rather different from what Zachary usually saw. He wondered if this was simply what it would feel like to get closer to someone and know them better. Their relationship was certainly different than when they first met, and it had changed in such a short time.\n\nA faint smile formed on Zachary’s face.\n\n「Is this what it’s like to have a friend?」\n\nHe rose to his feet and maintained his eyes on her.\n\nEach new meeting with her contained a new experience, and although this seemed like a sombre one, it seemed to be ending on a happier note. Having a friend like her with her support was enough to ease all the troubles in his mind. Perhaps this was the reason he had been more open and forward with things now.\n\nLauren turned the corner of her eye to his direction, and that was when she noticed his warm gaze. In that instant, her face reddened. She turned her head to his direction with an annoyed expression. “Wh-What…?”\n\nAfter putting his thoughts aside, he widened his eyes in surprise when he realized how long he had been gazing at her.\n\n“Um, nothing!”\n\nQuick on changing the subject, she pointed at his hand, “So… with our submission process being done with, we… should probably get your hand treated.”\n\n“Are you sure about that?” He was concerned. “Myung’s still in there,” and it almost seemed cynical how the person he desired to see the most had suddenly become the person he desired to avoid the most.\n\n“It’s fineeee!” She waved her hand casually with a smile on her face. She was slowly returning to her usual demeanor, “I’ve already talked with her a bit, and that’s enough for me. Plus, I don’t wanna force you in there after what happened.”\n\n“Just go in without me. I don’t want to keep you away from—”\n\n“I said it’s fine, you’re the priority now.”\n\n“But you’ve been waiting for this day.”\n\n“And I got what I wanted out of it. Now move it, Shepherd-Boy, your hand’s not gonna fix itself.”\n\n“I don’t even think it’s that bad.”\n\n“Zach…” She eyed him a serious look.\n\nHe took a look at his hand. The blood on his knuckles had somewhat dried off but it looked incredibly bruised. It needed a bit of medical attention. Looking at the wall to see blood smudged over it was surprising to him. He never imagined he had so much power in him to keep punching the wall. Wrath was terrifying.\n\n“Oh, don’t tell me you wanna get back in there?” Lauren noticed his long stare.\n\n「Gah, I’m getting distracted.」\n\nHe shook his head to freshen himself up.\n\n“No, let’s go… I’ve had my fill of anomalies for today.”\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nZachary walked back home alone.\n\nAfter tending to his injury, he departed with Lauren as he felt he didn't need to trouble her anymore. The walk home was indeed mundane and nothing to look forward to, but it wasn’t something he couldn’t handle — he had done this a million times, after all.\n\n「Should I write something when I get back?」\n\nHe was desperate for any type of distraction. But then another thought came to his mind, it wouldn’t have been wise for him to get back to writing immediately, even if writing soothed him oftentimes. If there was anything he needed at the moment, it was to rest, to take an entire break from writing altogether.\n\nLost in thought, he found himself bumping into someone.\n\nBoth of them almost twirled in opposite directions. Thankfully, he was able to recover easily. But the same could not be said about the other person.\n\n*crash*\n\nWhen Zachary came to, he realized that the person was carrying quite the big box with them. Their encounter with one another had led to them dropping their box and possibly breaking the contents from the sound of the impact. And indeed, there were a lot of pens on the ground, most of them were broken, which was surprising, considering a pen wouldn’t break that easily.\n\nFor a moment, he thought there was noise covering them, but then he noticed that the person was a young woman, and most of all, he could clearly see her.\n\n“Dammit! Elliot is gonna give me an earful,” she spoke with a distressed yet soothing tone. It seemed that even if she were to get angry and try to shout, her blissful voice would prevent it.\n\nFeeling a little guilty inside, Zachary apologized, “I am so sorry! I—”\n\n“It’s alright,” the girl turned to look at him and gave him a clumsy smile, “I wasn’t looking where I was going, the box was in the way, but it’s still my fault.”\n\nThe young woman seemed to be at a below-average height, she was certainly shorter than him and perhaps around Lauren’s height if he were to compare them. Her purple hair was wrapped into a bun, yet still seemed unkempt in some areas. Round glasses covered her brown eyes and almost took over all her face from how big they were. She was dressed in a yellow oversized hoodie that reached almost her knees, and even with that, her dark jeans shorts were still visible.\n\nIf there were two words to describe the aura she possessed: casual and messy. That was what Zachary believed at least.\n\nJudging appearances aside, he quickly moved to help her collect the things that had dropped out of the box. “Let me help you pick them up,” he didn’t remember the last time he was this kind to someone, or if he was ever kind enough to lend a helping hand before.\n\n“Oh, there’s no need for you to do that,” she waved her hand at him, “I’m—”\n\nBut before she could continue, he was already on the ground collecting the pens and putting them back in the box.\n\n“Okay… I guess,” she accepted his help and went on to collect her things as well.\n\nAfter a few minutes of collecting and searching for broken and lost pens, they were able to place everything back in the box, although the contents were, of course, in a much worse state than before.\n\n“How could a pen break this easily?” Zachary accidentally spoke his thoughts.\n\n“I blame production for that,” the young woman sighed, “But my boss insists on still working with them,” she then tried to clean the dust off her clothes, “Putting that aside, is there any way I can repay you?”\n\n“Repay me?” He was surprised, “For what? I barely did anything, and the pens are still broken.”\n\n“No, you did take a moment out of your time to help me, which barely anyone does in this town apparently,” she chuckled, “I believe that’s worth repaying.”\n\nShe had a point, an absurd one, but it was still a fair point.\n\n“Here, how about this?” She reached for the inside of the box and pulled out a pen that seemed to be still in pristine condition.\n\n“A pen?” He backed away, “I-I can’t take this, it’s the only one that’s still good.”\n\n“Yea, you’ll take it, and for free,” she slammed it onto his palm and then gave him a smile, “Consider us even now.”\n\n「I wasn’t even thinking you were in my debt.」\n\n“You know,” she inched closer to his face, “You shouldn’t deny what’s rightfully yours. You could lose someone because of that.”\n\nHer voice was still soothing to the ears and quite mesmerizing, the kind of childlike voice you would hear out of an adult and never an actual child.\n\n“Anyway, I better get going,” she backed away and closed her box, “You take good care of that pen, alright?”\n\nAnd with that, the odd young woman was gone.\n\nZachary looked down at the pen. It was a black and gold ballpoint pen, which would certainly fit for someone in an office for work, and not for a high schooler like him — and not for free. Nevertheless, he had no choice but to accept it.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nSince he was already in the street that was overlooked by his home, Zachary proceeded down to the gate and walked inside.\n\nWith the road of concrete coming to an end and turning into a spiral, a fancy front yard came into view. Coupled with a fountain and a car or two parked just outside, it had the whole setup of a fancy mansion yard. However, it was still not impressive in his eyes, no matter how many times he looked at it.\n\nWhenever he came back home, Zachary would always rush in, never to look up at the mansion directly or see who was around — he had a general idea of what the mansion looked like after living there for years. So when he did look up this time, he was shocked by what he saw.\n\nHe was not faced by the shadows of a decrepit house.\n\nHe was faced with eyes, two glaring eyes.\n\nThe eyes of a woman sitting on the balcony. She seemed to be having a cup of tea by herself. But now she was fixated on the terror-stricken eyes of Zachary’s.\n\nThat woman wasn’t his aunt, nor was she his cousin, nor a maid, nor anyone that came to his mind. And of course, she wouldn’t come to his mind. He stopped looking at her face a few years back. After all, it was saturated by a burn mark, a grim reminder of a life that was once forgotten.\n\nThat woman was his mother.\n\n“...” He stopped in his tracks for the few seconds he locked eyes with her.\n\nIt was wide open, deprived of any ounce of passion.\n\nZachary felt a chill run down his spine. His petrified face was proof of that. He felt as if it was being slowly pulled away from the rest of his body.\n\nThey looked at each other for the first time in forever from afar. There were no words spoken. Just a ghastly stare from a mother to her child.\n\nHe rarely talked to her directly, and even when he did, he would never look her in the face, only opting to listen to her melancholic voice.\n\n「No... not anymore...!」\n\nShifting his gaze away from her quickly, he climbed the entrance’s stairs and reached for the door.\n\n「And here I thought I’d start to feel better…」",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 8 - The Evershine Star\n\nstar /stɑː/\n\na person who is preeminent in a particular field.\n\nIt was still the middle of September, yet Halloween was inching closer with each passing day in the eyes of the townspeople.\n\nA new breath of fresh air breathed into the town’s life — truly a place that thrived on gloom. Everille School had busy weeks ahead of it, and despite the decrease in numbers of students and staff as of late, there were a lot of them coming back all of a sudden. No one would miss a festive event no matter what it was after all.\n\nEveryone wore masks of joy on their faces as they roamed the entirety of the school back and forth, fulfilling their tasks to bring the spooky holiday into life. The halls were filled with all types of colorful festive decorations, with the most prominent colors being orange and black. Pumpkins were placed at every classroom door. It was strangely endearing for a high school as gloomy as this to shift into the life of an elementary school. The school finally took a change for once.\n\nIt was all as if a child’s wish had suddenly come true.\n\nEverything changed. Everyone changed; everyone but Zachary.\n\nIt wasn’t that he was still carrying that monotonous feeling everywhere he went like he used to — he utilized Lauren’s lessons as best he could. He simply wasn’t a holiday type of guy, be it Halloween, Easter, or even Christmas. Gaining a new perspective on life could still not soothe his heart from viewing these bright occasions as shallow.\n\nAs everyone went about with their day, Zachary stood alone in an empty hallway. He did not particularly search for the emptiest hall. He was interested in taking a look at the trophy showcase nestled right in front of him.\n\nAfter the setback that was the book conference and a little bit of encouraging words from Lauren, he thought a while for himself on what the next step should be. He and Lauren were no longer exactly on the same step as he thought. Fear blinded him, but not her.\n\nAnd so, he ended up here, in the hallway of honored students — of champions, as some call it — gazing at shiny objects and simple names that attained victory one day.\n\nThere was an award for “Best Football Player”; for “Honorary Student of 19XX”; for “Culture Festival Winner”; for “Writing Competition Winner,” and for several other things. All of these trophies with names, dating back decades upon decades ago, once belonged to people. But where were they now? Not a single name gained recognition afterwards. They lived (and died) with their names on a decrepit shelf being the only fame they got.\n\n“Chase your dreams… You’ll get there someday…” Zachary chuckled wryly, mocking the words that were once and would be told to him if he were to ever give up.\n\nHe found this awful reality as just a twisted joke. Maybe what happened to him was not so bad, he wondered. But even so—\n\n「Not everything is said and done yet.」\n\nHe believed he had something these other “successful” people did not, something that would steer him away from being “just another name on the shelf.” He knew the end of it all, what lies after the chase was over.\n\nThe solution lied in knowing the outcome. He had the end result no one did in his grasp, like a time traveler with knowledge of impending doom and aiming to avert by changing the past. If that analogy was of any semblance to him, then he needed to stop moping around and start moving. This was the “past” that needed to be changed.\n\n“I finally found you!”\n\nAnd in came the voice of reason, Lauren, with a wide smile persisting on her face like usual.\n\nIt had been a weird period ever since he met Lauren. Despite its one low, it felt too good to be true when it came to its happier moments. The day she left after stopping by his house felt like the first and last day he would ever see her. He was confident she would never return or talk to him with all that she had seen of him. Yet on the next day, she rushed right in front of his desk after classes were over to talk about her day like someone who hadn’t seen their best friend in a while.\n\n「A friend…」\n\n“Are you still upset about the other day?” She broke through his trance. It was a usual thing for her to disturb his thought process, he wasn’t annoyed or shocked at it anymore.\n\n“Oh?” He pondered over her question for a moment, “No, I am okay, over the moon, in fact. I’m simply… trophy-watching.”\n\n“Trophy… watching?” She raised an eyebrow, and slightly curled her lip at the ridiculousness of the term, “Like… these trophies?” She pointed at the glass shelf beside them.\n\n“Precisely!” He snapped his fingers.\n\nThanks to some of Lauren’s influence, he had become a little more open in his conversations with her — perhaps even delving into the excessive area.\n\n“Enough about me though,” He attempted to change the subject, “You seem livelier than before. Enjoying the spirit of the death holiday?”\n\n“W-wha? I swear you come up with some of the weirdest terms. How do you say them so casually?” she snorted, “But no, I’m not really into it at the moment. It feels a little weird.”\n\nShe was right.\n\nIt was bizarre how not only everyone in school but in town, had suddenly awakened this desire for this holiday an entire month and a half before the supposed date.\n\n“If you’re talking about how everyone is having the time of their lives while we sulk around like this, then yes, I guess it is a little weird.”\n\n“Right?” Lauren widened her eyes in surprise, “I never imagined they’d celebrate it. Whenever I ask someone about it, they just smile and tell me they’re too busy, or just ignore me altogether.”\n\nThis content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\n\nThey both felt comforted by the fact that they shared the same feelings for this strange occurrence. Zachary, in particular, had that feeling of being an outcast be slowly stripped away, or rather he wasn’t the only outcast anymore.\n\nHe cleared his throat, “This is the result of the government’s efforts to expand the capitalist system.”\n\n“Who-with-the-what-now?” She rapidly blinked, she was dumbfounded by his sudden claim.\n\n“I don’t know. It just came to the top of my head for some reason.”\n\nPerhaps openly speaking his thoughts was not always the best method, she thought.\n\n“The point is, the town has been thrown into a trance.”\n\nLauren looked at Zachary with skepticism. The people in the town weren’t the only ones that went through a weird shift in behavior.\n\nSomething seemed off about Zachary as well. It wasn’t that he was on the same level as everyone else. It almost seemed to her that he was forcing himself to speak. There was no doubt in her mind that the influence of the other day was still affecting him.\n\nHowever, before she can speak—\n\n“That’s exactly what I was thinking of!”\n\nA voice echoed from behind Lauren and a boy emerged, approaching the both of them with a smile on his face. He stood at an average height, around Zachary's height.\n\nJust who was this guy to talk to them all of a sudden like he was a friend who needed no introductions or greetings? Zachary raised an eyebrow at his audacity, not even he was as blunt as that guy was — not that he would easily approach anyone with his nature. He looked at Lauren to expect a similar expression from her, but she seemed strangely all right with the guy approaching them.\n\n“It’s like someone just flipped a switch or something,” the boy laughed and Lauren laughed right after.\n\n\"Oh?! Yeong-Gi?! H-Hey...!\" Lauren seemed almost flustered by the boy's appearance, quickly turning her face downward before looking back again at him, \"How... How are you doing?\"\n\n\"Enjoying this weird holiday magic as much I can,\" he laughed.\n\n“You’re right. I guess holidays do have a little magic to them like they used to say,” she chuckled.\n\n「Huh...?!」\n\nThe two of them spoke together as if Zachary was but a stand-in happening to be there. Multiple thoughts went through his head, the kind that he had desperately tried to push away after so long. But he knew better than to succumb to his ridiculous thoughts like always this time.\n\n「No no, stop being a brainless idiot and leave me alone. That boy’s just a friend.」\n\n“By the way, I’m glad I saw you now,\" Lauren smiled, \"Did you manage to fix my watch?”\n\n“Well no...,\" the boy scratched his chin with an embarrassed face, \"But I did give it to a friend of mine who managed to fix it. She just gave it to me today, as a matter of fact.\"\n\n\"Oh... she...?\" Her smile faded for a second, “That's good.”\n\nAfter being done with delivering the good news to her, the boy waved at Zachary. “Hey there!”\n\nIt seemed the boy was not just a halfwit who lacked manners and thought it’d be prudish only to talk to Lauren without acknowledging Zachary’s existence.\n\nHowever, it was Zachary himself who lacked the courage to speak up. He came to the realization that he was completely alright with being ignored. To his luck, Lauren was still caught up with her own matter.\n\n“Do you have it with you right now?” She interrupted.\n\n“Oh, no actually, but I left it in my bag. I was heading to the gym right after hanging those flyers, they need me for something,” he pointed at the flyers on the bulletin board right beside the trophy shelf, “But then I spotted you and thought I’d do a quick stop to notify you. I can give it to you after school though.”\n\n“Wait, you're helping out with that stuff?! That's not like you at all, heh.”\n\n“Yeah, my friend dragged me into it — she has an addiction to running errands,\" the boy chuckled, \"It's not that bad actually. Better than doing nothing.”\n\nLauren smiled before glancing at Zachary with a slight firm look, urging him to join in on the conversation. She, of all people, understood him well, despite knowing him for a short period so far. But he felt fine being stuck to the expression game with her at that moment, and so he replied back with an oafish expression, raising both his shoulders upwards to signify his distress on what to do exactly.\n\nNaturally, the boy caught wind of their little game, and he knew better than to stick around. “Well, I better get going then. I’ll meet up with you later?”\n\n“Um, s-sure!” Lauren smiled and waved at him.\n\nThe boy paid no heed to Zachary and walked away.\n\n「Finally!」\n\nJust as he was completely out of their sight, Zachary immediately jumped to the question. “Who was that guy?”\n\n“Yeong-Gi! He's an old friend!\" Lauren happily responded.\n\n“Uh huh…” He gave her a look of displeasure.\n\n\"He was the winner of last year's writing competition at school.\"\n\n“So he's a writer?! No wonder he’s so optimistic.”\n\nOddly enough, two students passed right beside them as they were running the halls with costumes on.\n\nZachary and Lauren turned their heads back at each other, with estranged looks at the scene they had just witnessed. It looked like a lot of people already had the holiday spirit in them — to the extent of just wreaking havoc like children.\n\n“Not as optimistic as everyone else as you can see,” he said as he scoffed.\n\nWill all worries fade away if he adapted to the same mentality as everyone else? He wondered. Perhaps their eyes observed the world that he longed for. Thinking about that was enough to wear him down further on how he was missing something that seemed so magnificent to the others.\n\n「But I’m not alone.」\n\n“Hey…” Lauren placed her hand on his shoulder. Her face carried a warm look of content, but then she wrinkled her eyes and her lips opened, revealing her sparkling teeth, causing her face to beam with joy. “Maybe all we need right now is a little bit of that optimism!”\n\nAn indication of reassurance, that was what this was.\n\nThis girl had enchanted him a long time ago. Nothing she would ever do could rile him up. Everything about her eased his mind. It was amazing how close they’ve gotten and come to understand one another over one shared interest. One interest sparked this adventure.\n\n「And yet…」\n\n“Here!” She reached for her pocket and dropped a gold coin into his palm.\n\nIt was the same gold coin from the other day, decorated with the same design as the hanging man. The fact that she had it on her at that moment greatly bewildered Zachary.\n\n“You carry that around everywhere?” He was astonished.\n\n“Yeah, it’s my good-luck coin.”\n\n“Why are you giving it to me?”\n\n“I just told you, it’s my good-luck coin. So… you know, good luck!”\n\nShe pushed herself away from him and walked backwards.\n\n“Keep it with you till the results come out. You’ll need it!” She winked and formed a finger gun before pointing it at him. “Catch you on the flipside.”\n\nAnd like that, she left just as she came. Sudden farewells from her were not much of a surprise anymore. She was the type of person who would get straight to the topic to get their point across and then be done with it.\n\nYet still, it left sombreness in Zachary’s heart.\n\n“Right…” He smiled, although that smile conveyed ambivalence rather than joy.\n\nHe wished those short moments with each other would prolong, he wished for it ever since that day they went out to the Old Pier. That day still remained as the longest he had spent with her, and nothing ever came close to it once again. It was as if she had given him a forbidden fruit that he completely devoured and then stripped it away from him when he desired more.\n\n「You’re really cruel, you know that.」\n\nA sigh escaped his breath, followed by a smile.\n\nDespite everything, they were still going to be together. Their path was merely starting.\n\nThere was still hope.",

His body stiffened. His skin crawled. His legs nestled like logs. His chest barely shuddered. His mouth quivered, and his lips were dry. His toneless eyes gawked. There wasn’t an ounce of life within him.\n\nThe results were out.\n\n“...”\n\n【MELANVALE WRITING CONTEST SCORE SHEET】\n\n【#1 - Lauren Cherith : 208/210】\n\n【#2 - Anju Tilden : 184/210】\n\n【#3 - Yeong-gi Baek : 179/210】\n\n“I… I won?!” Lauren gasped.\n\nBut her voice immediately faded away, Zachary was fixated on something else. His eyes spiraled up and down, left and right, scrutinizing the entire list that consisted of all contestants’ scores.\n\n「Zachary Ashworth…」\n\nIn his mind, he constantly recited his name, waiting for the moment his eyes would lock onto it.\n\n「Zachary Ashworth…」\n\nThe list went on and seemed like it was never-ending. He was already past the fifties and into the seventies.\n\n「Zachary Ashworth…」\n\nAnd then… the list ended.\n\nOut of three hundred contestants, only a hundred of them were listed on the scoreboard. Two hundred people, with dreams and stories to tell, were completely unaccounted for — not even an honorable mention for some at the bottom. Two hundred kids were left in the mud, including Zachary Ashworth.\n\nNot a glimpse of emotion dwelled within him. He could do nothing but acknowledge the facts, the cruel fact that anyone like him would break down for.\n\nLauren had won. Zachary was forgotten.\n\n“T-This is really my name?! It’s unbelievable!!! I’m in first place! I won, I won, I won, I won,” Lauren cried with joy.\n\nHer striking accomplishment had rendered her blind to her surroundings. She was still struggling with the fact that she had come out on top of everyone else. By winning the contest, not only will she get her story officially published, but she would be granted the chance at writing a full novel with the help of a publishing company, and possibly a helping hand from her idol, Myung. This was her great chance to become an actual author.\n\nHowever, she wasn’t the only one thinking about the possibilities.\n\nZachary shivered at those thoughts. All those awards, those opportunities that were going to be granted to his friend, things that he desperately wished for and worked hard to get, he wasn’t getting even a taste of it.\n\nHe and his story were thrown in the trash.\n\nWhen Lauren calmed down and came to the other realization that Zachary wasn’t anywhere on the list, she placed her hand on her mouth in shock.\n\nHelp support creative writers by finding and reading their stories on the original site.\n\n“(Oh? Oh no, oh my god…,)” She spoke under her breath.\n\nEven with her victory, she worried for her friend.\n\n“Zach… I…,” she tried to find the words. For the first time in her life, she felt that she lacked the words to offer comfort, “I’m so sorry… I didn’t…”\n\nShe tried to place her hand on his back to ease his tension.\n\nBut Zachary turned and knocked her hand away with the back of his hand.\n\nThe irises in his eyes had shrunk to a terrible extent. Tears were dropping.\n\nLauren was equally shocked from that push, but she tried to understand his grief, “Listen, I know we made a promise. But I have no hand in this and you know it. I understand what you’re going through. You were—”\n\nHer words then came to a halt, and instead something else came out.\n\n“gùð agdo oðdeox tiihot oþþahd onhpò”\n\nIt was back.\n\nThe noise was back.\n\nOf course, it was back. It had been slowly growing ever since the meeting.\n\nZachary felt the world around him spin. His vision had become distorted. The noise was crawling back into his sight.\n\nIt was covering her.\n\nThe noise was covering her, the girl that took his hand and promised of a road they could together. But now she was running, slipping away, and he couldn’t keep up with her. In reality, however, he was shunning her out.\n\n「No, shut up, you worthless dumbass.」\n\nHe screamed back at his thoughts in his mind.\n\nNothing had changed, he hasn’t changed. Every time that fact would come crashing down on him, he would try to avoid it, but now it was right in his face. He had to face it. He had always been nobody special, that was who Zachary Ashworth was. Why should he be mad now? Why should he be mad about something that he knew was inevitable?\n\n「I’m worse than a pile of trash.」\n\nIt was disgusting, his mind was disgusting, he was disgusting. He believed he should be happy for his friend. She had done so much for him, but he was the one that brought himself down. She was a star that tried to light his path, but he cowered away in the darkness. He had no place in that bright-colored sky.\n\nThere was no place for someone whose heart burned with envy for those he once trusted.\n\n“Ipiates…”\n\nLauren’s voice echoed again. There were no words to be understood.\n\n「I’m worthless.」\n\nComing with this conclusion, and realizing what he was truly like, he raised his fist and punched himself on the face. It hurt him, but he believed it should have hurt him more, he deserved worse.\n\nLauren backed away. However, he couldn’t see her face, he didn’t know what look she had on. Was she scared? Was she shocked? Was she smiling?\n\n「No!」\n\nGathering control of his surroundings, Zachary picked up his feet and dashed out of the place, running away from everything.\n\nHe had to run away. There was no place for him here.\n\nInto the outside he went, the sky was clouded. Rain dropped down on the streets vigorously, yet he kept running.\n\nHe ran…\n\n...and ran…\n\n...slipped…\n\n...stood back up…\n\n…and then ran again…\n\nSomehow, this all seemed familiar to him.\n\nAnd of course, why wouldn’t it?\n\nThis was the same thing he did the first day he met Lauren and spoke with her. He ran away that day through the streets deep in the rain. However, it was still different.\n\nThat day, he returned back to her with hope.\n\nBut now…\n\nIf he returned back to her now, then he would be clinging onto false hope, onto a lie that he has been telling to himself over and over.\n\n「Nothing’s changed. I’m still that hopeless idiot.」\n\nNo matter how far he thought he had come, he was still at the bottom of the pit. There was no place for a change in him. Change went against his nature. It was why he felt uncomfortable at times, why he struggled, why he believed it was all a dream. Because that was all it was… a false dream.\n\nZachary stood out in the rain, drowning in hopelessness.\n\n“For once… just for once!”\n\nHe wondered if the droplets dripping down his cheeks were his tears or if that was simply just the rain doing its magic and sorrow for him.\n\n“I want to want! I want to do something for myself!”\n\nHe lacked the luxury to cry.\n\n“...”\n\nHe walked again, lost in his thoughts.\n\n「I…」\n\n“Get out of the way!”\n\nAll of a sudden, a voice screamed into his ear, the only voice that still carried words somehow. But before he could turn around and react, he felt a hand touch him on the back and push him away.\n\nHowever, the push was too late. There was no escaping the inevitable.\n\nAnd that was when he realized he had walked right into the middle of the street.\n\nHe had been so caught up in his own stupid thoughts that he failed to notice his surroundings. In the end, it was him and his bleak mind that led to his demise.\n\nA huge, bright light emerged, approaching both him and the one who pushed him at high speed, followed by a loud screech.\n\n「So this is the end…」\n\n*CRASH*\n\nThat was the last thing Zachary Ashworth saw… light.\n\n「Finally…」",

Unimaginable chaos; the chaos of a thousand-year war. It was a battlefield of endless slaughter. Mountains of bodies were forming everywhere, yet the warriors never stopped moving forward.\n\nTwo sides of the world, fighting at wits’ end.\n\n「One…」\n\n「Two…」\n\nKnights clashed their swords in the midst of the field. Archers stood by from afar as they shot their arrows. Lancers left their horses to blissful death. Monsters howled in rage at their fallen. Yet one could not tell who was the enemy.\n\nIn a world of great fiction, it would be a tale as old as time. Humans against monsters. Good against evil. But this was not a piece of fiction.\n\nThis was reality… and reality never made sense.\n\nEveryone was out for their own skin, even the beasts, who were not so mindless as a yarn in a tavern would deem them.\n\n「One…」\n\n「Two…」\n\nIf monsters were to be named, it would surely not be the beasts forced to survive, and not the humans like some tales claim to defy a commoner’s expectations. The true monsters were those in the beyond. The arbiters that orchestrated this cruel fate upon a beautiful world. God created everything, but everything sought to destroy itself.\n\nThis was but a twisted belief in the eyes of the swordsman, calmly treading the battlefield on his horse like a watcher from beyond. Unseen and unscathed.\n\nIt wasn’t that he was truly unseen. With a suit of armor darker than black, a face covered under the hood, and a greatsword that has seen a million battles, this swordsman was to be left alone. No one dared to fend off his threatening aura. He was a beast of darkness disguised in human flesh, cursed forever within to walk the path of the moon.\n\n「One…」\n\n「Two…」\n\nIn his thoughts, he counted. No more than twice each time he passed a certain distance. What was it that he counted? The number of soldiers who were struck down? Perhaps the time it took for a beast to devour one whole? Or anything that his eyes gazed upon in the battlefield? No one knew.\n\nNevertheless, the battle moved and he traveled across like a ghost.\n\nThe wind was starting to catch up and whistle even as the warriors persisted. This was the fate of those who battled for the strongest. Of course, there were some more who strived to achieve peace in war: a war to end all wars. But such fantasy did not exist here.\n\nYou could be reading stolen content. Head to Royal Road for the genuine story.\n\n「One…」\n\nJust as the swordsman with the giant greatsword began counting again, his thought process was interrupted as he came to a halt. Among the crowds and weapons blocking the clear view, covered by smog, stood a great and broad figure. Normally one would suspect it for a beast, but that was far from the truth. It was human, but to paint him as one like any other would be nothing but a poor jest.\n\n“Souken…,” uttered the swordsman.\n\nCladded in armor of great protection, the giant man soon shared his gaze with the swordsman. He could not help but salivate at this chance encounter once again.\n\nHe knew him. And the swordsman knew him as well.\n\nOther soldiers rushed in and attempted to slice that man open, but he would take their life away like he did a fly. It was strange how simpletons like them would risk their life away for that man but not the swordsman who seemed much easier to clash with due to his smaller figure.\n\nHowever, that did not mean the swordsman lacked any height at all. The moment he stepped down his horse, he was still reaching half the height he was at when on top of it. He towered over most of the warriors nearby. But he did not care, for his target, his mission, was that man, who towered over him as much as he did for others, the berserker.\n\nThey stood at an impasse before even starting. The berserker was sure to take down the swordsman in one blow from his mace. But the swordsman was calculating a similar method, counting not only the time it would take for his opponent to draw out his open but how much it would take to land a hit. The berserker was quite strong so even a weapon as heavy as mace would be no problem to swing in a second. However, what he was flawed at, the swordsman excelled.\n\nThere was one thing for sure to set this battle: it was a matter of speed.\n\nThe swordsman reached for his greatsword. But the berserker had already drawn first blood — or at least, he thought he would.\n\nClosing the distance between him and the swordsman, the berserker inched closer with his grip on his mace in the air, ready to strike. And as he did…\n\n「One…」\n\nIn a flash, the swordsman moved aside, dodging the attack completely. But the berserker was already on the move for another attack. Despite his size, he was light on his feet and quick with his blows. The mace was already swinging the swordsman's way, who was yet to draw out his sword.\n\n“Shoulda brought a knife cutter, ye bastard!” Shouted the berserker.\n\n「Two…」\n\nWith a swift motion, the swordsman ducked and rolled out of the mace’s away, all in a second.\n\n“W-What?!” Cried the berserker in confusion.\n\nIf he could cut back on his attack, he would, but he had put everything into that swing that he could not stop before finishing it. It would take a whole two seconds to return back to form. Sure enough, one second had passed and his swing was slowing down. He quickly thought of swinging it back after the next second to the swordsman’s direction. But as he looked over, he could not comprehend what was before him in such a short time.\n\nNot only was the swordsman standing on his feet with his greatsword fully unsheathed, he got off his feet in less than a second and went in for a strike. He did not cry for battle. He was not angry. He was silent the entire fight through.\n\n*SLICE*\n\nTrue to his reaction a second ago, the berserker was too late to comprehend what happened to him. The greatsword, that accursed sword, was struck right directly into his heart, piercing through his once-great armor.\n\nThere was no reaction on the swordsman’s face, who the man could see now from being so close to him. No expression of victory. Just a solemn look of death.\n\n“The Lord of the Owls has fallen…”\n\nIt was done. That lone battle among the war was over.\n\nThe swordsman took out his greatsword before the man that was once a berserker fell to his knees and then landed on the ground, leaving a lifeless husk on the ground in the process.\n\n“May the sands of time and the tower of souls pray for your bygone flesh,” the swordsman mumbled to himself, hoping his words would reach the soul of his dead opponent, “Else you’ll drown in a sea of bane.”\n\nThe swordsman swung his sword aside to clean off the blood before sheathing it on his back.\n\nThe war was still going like nothing ever happened. After all, nothing really happened. It only took five seconds to start and finish the fight with ease. There was nothing of note here that would be visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe swordsman sighed and looked up at the sky that was barely visible from the dust. But even then, the moon’s light shined like never before. It was beautiful to a point that it was haunting.\n\nHowever, the swordsman did not mind. He admired it.\n\nHe remembered the words a hanged man once said to him.\n\n“A wish for faint light. A wish for great blight. By the by, do you crave desire? Dream of an elusive age? The moon will grant all should the champions fall.”\n\nOnce again, the dark knight had slaughtered another prey.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 10 - Reality or Dreams?\n\ndream /driːm/\n\nan unrealistic or self-deluding fantasy.\n\nWhat is true death?\n\nOne could have so many hopes and dreams, and be entirely oblivious to the concept of death before their life is suddenly snatched away at a moment’s notice.\n\nSo what does it mean to have a rightful death? Could someone possibly die without having accomplished anything, without doing right by their life?\n\nIf this was a world of fantasy; if it were the fanciful world of a reclusive loner deprived of any imagination, then one would die with ease in their heart, knowing full well their wasted lives will be revived in a new world to their liking that would make something out of them, make them new people.\n\nBut this wasn’t that fanciful world.\n\nFor he was still far from death.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nOpening his eyes as best he could, which felt like they hadn't been opened in years from how dry they were — any more and he’d feel his eye sockets being pulled out — Zachary Ashworth was met with a scene of faint light.\n\nBefore he knew it, the light had turned into a completely white surface. However, it wasn’t a case of being hit with a light so bright causing temporary blindness. The scene had become clearer: a simple scene that almost everyone would see upon their awakening in the morning. This was just a ceiling; a white, fluorescent, ceiling. Nothing out of the ordinary thus far.\n\nHad he been awakened from a dream? The first question hit his thoughts.\n\nBut his mind was elsewhere. There was a sound echoing in his ear, which seemed to be suppressed from how gruff it was. Simply put, it was a matter of his ears not opening up fully yet. Be that as it may, he strived to know what it was — it had been written in his nature. Following the pattern at which it resonated, and matching it with the times his heart struck a beat, it was easy to determine what this was. In fact, it was easy to determine where he was.\n\nSleeping on an unfamiliar bed. Awoken to an unfamiliar white ceiling. Long fluorescent lights. Tired eyes and ears that were still off in dreamland. A feeling of unrest. A heart-rate monitor.\n\n「The hospital…?」\n\nWith one answer covered, he moved onto the next. He tried as best he could to remember what had happened prior for him to end up in a hospital of all places.\n\nA cold scene of the streets flashed in his eyes.\n\n“...!”\n\nIt all came back to him.\n\nThe somber sky. The rain. The cold street. The push. The light.\n\n*CRASH*\n\n「So cold…」\n\nIt was a cold evening on a Fall’s day, he remembered, so cold the snow — out of time and place — wailed and wavered against the wind. He could only remember the feeling of the glacial surface that was beneath him, the piercing frost that crawled all over his body and deeming it all numb from the pain. After that… sleep; long and cold sleep.\n\nAn accident like that, in the eyes of many, would result in tragedy.\n\nYet here he was, sitting on a bed in a hospital, recovering from whatever injuries had sprung up in his body.\n\nZachary was still alive.\n\n「Can’t have what I want… even in death.」\n\n“Oh?! M-Mr. Ashworth?! You’re awake?!”\n\nA voice, unfamiliar to his ears, echoed in the place.\n\nStill in his dizzy and half-conscious state, he tried to focus on what the voice said. It didn’t matter who was there, it mattered that someone was there. Someone could tell him what happened after the accident, and that was all he needed at the moment.\n\n“What…” He mustered up all his strength and tried to clear his sore throat, “What happened?”\n\nGathering up all his strength, he tilted his head slightly to the left, toward the direction the voice came from. Sure enough, there was someone standing beside him. He was tall and coated in a lab coat. It was no doubt a doctor. Surrounding him were a few nurses with looks of distress and astonishment on their faces.\n\n“Um…,” the doctor seemed to have a look of surprise and confusion plastered on his face, “You were involved in a truck accident. B-But… it seems like you’re okay…,” he turned to the nurse beside him, “Go get Dr. Geller, now! His patient’s awake.”\n\nThe nurse immediately rushed out of the room.\n\nSomething seemed off about the doctor, Zachary could feel it, even in his dizzy state. The doctor’s words did not seem like ones that would come out of a professional one. Usually, they’d explain his situation a little bit clearer and shed some light on his condition from a medical aspect. Yet, this doctor seemed unprepared, like he hadn’t expected a patient’s awakening.\n\n“Zach!”\n\nThere was a voice, someone, calling out his name, seemingly coming from the outside. It sounded familiar, however… too familiar for his own comfort. He knew who it was calling out to him, but he wished they weren’t.\n\nAnd then his suspicion was confirmed when she rushed in.\n\nRight at the doorway stood the girl that he had once shared a promise with, that same girl that he had rejected, that same girl that had caused him to run away and find himself in this sorry situation. It was Lauren Cherith.\n\nZachary’s eyes widened in shock. He could see her face now.\n\nThere were tears in her eyes as she smiled, it was clear she was happy that he was alive. “Zach! You’re—”\n\nBut Zachary did not care.\n\nHe slowly turned his head to the other side, averting his gaze from Lauren’s, and looked at the window — he didn’t want to face her after everything that happened.\n\n“Z-Zach…?!”\n\n“Miss, I’ll have to ask you to leave for now.” Another nurse, different from the one that left, stepped in front of Lauren and attempted to push her out of the room.\n\n“W-Wait, I know him. I’m the one that’s been here—”\n\n“The patient’s not ready for visits at the moment.”\n\nWith that, Lauren was forced out of the room and was gone.\n\nYet everything still felt like it was in disarray. Zachary could hear noise from the people around him. Everyone was rushing to do whatever task they were required to do. It was as if his awakening had caused a great commotion. Why were there so many nurses coming in and out of the room?\n\n“I’m sure you’re quite confused, Mr. Ashworth,” said the doctor.\n\nStolen content warning: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.\n\nThere was only one thing on Zachary’s mind at the moment.\n\n“How…,” he let out a grunt as he turned back, “How long have I been… how long have I been out?”\n\nThe doctor turned aside and let out a deep sigh, “One uh… It's been one day since the accident.”\n\n“Wha…” Zachary would almost laugh if he could.\n\nThere was no way he would have woken a day right after the accident had happened, especially with the injuries he would have sustained. A person involved in an accident like this would regain their consciousness, at the least, one or two weeks after.\n\n「Just what the hell is going on with me?」\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nIt was no lie, just a pure stroke of a miracle.\n\nAccording to what the doctor who oversaw Zachary’s condition said, he had been in a truck accident with another individual that tried to save his life. However, the medical examination revealed that he mainly sustained major injuries in his legs, and that might be partially due to the girl who pushed him. Most of the bones in his legs were fractured, the doctors refused to elaborate further on whether he could walk again or not, but he already knew the answer.\n\nWhat baffled the doctors, and frankly, everyone else was the fact that he had woken up no less than twenty-four hours after the accident, while the other girl who was with him had fallen into a coma. No one simply just wakes up from an accident the following day like they’d wake up from a good night’s sleep.\n\nThis didn’t grab a reaction from Zachary though.\n\nThere was something else in his mind that he kept thinking about that bothered him greatly. It wasn’t a question about why he was still alive, or if he was contemplating the reality that he might be stuck in a wheelchair from now on.\n\n「Why can I listen?」\n\nFor many years, he had been able to “shun” people he desired nothing from. If they were avoidable, they were just noise. He hated it as much as he favored it. It brought him into his own little world where he could listen to just himself. Naturally, everyone in the world became “noise” to him, their words were incoherent, and their faces were unclear. Only a noticeable few were free of that, like Lauren, who broke through his shell once.\n\nBut now… there were no longer particular individuals he could listen to, he could listen to everyone. The noise was entirely gone, and he couldn’t revert it back. He was able to even listen to Lauren, the last one he had shunned out.\n\n「Lauren…」\n\nShe was probably still outside, worried about him.\n\nWhen he asked the nurse who was out waiting for him, he found out his family was nowhere to be found, despite them immediately covering the bills for his treatment. Lauren was most likely the only one that came for him. Only she was waiting for him, only she truly cared for him, yet he still did not want to meet her. He didn’t want to see her, especially now that he could no longer hear the noise.\n\nAt that moment, he heard the door open. There was a hand slipping in from the outside and then proceeded to knock on the door. A second later, someone leaned their head in to take a look. He knew who it was.\n\nIt was Lauren.\n\n“S-Sorry, if this isn’t the right time,” she stepped inside with an apologetic smile on her face before closing the door behind her.\n\nOne look at her and Zachary could tell how worried she was about him. Her face was not in the best shape, she looked like she was suffering from a little bit of fatigue, even her previously sparkling eyes seemed to be desperate for sleep.\n\nBut he didn’t care and so, he looked away.\n\nShe stayed in her place, keeping quite the distance between him and her, “I uh… I’m… glad to see you’re fine,” her voice and words carried a tinge of sympathy, “A-At least you seem to…”\n\n“Yeah, I’m fine alright…,” he scoffed, “For a guy who can’t feel his legs.”\n\n「Just leave me be.」\n\nHe didn’t particularly hold her at fault for what happened to him. But it was hard for him to look at her, to stay with her, to talk with her. There was no meaning to their interactions now. Her presence would only hurt him, and his offensive attitude would only hurt her.\n\n“Listen um…,” she struggled to find the words, “They… they called me… yesterday after I left. The… the contest committee and—”\n\n“I don’t wanna talk about it. I don’t wanna talk about anything, just get out of here!” He turned and almost snapped at her.\n\nLauren’s smile was long gone, and in its stead, was pure shock and sorrow. Any moment now and tears might drop from her eyes. That was exactly the kind of thing Zachary wanted to avoid, but then again, when did anything ever work his way?\n\n“No,” she wasn’t going to give up, “You gotta listen to—”\n\n“Zachary Ashworrrrrth!!!”\n\nA voice screamed from the outside, stunning both Zachary and Lauren at the same time and putting their conversation at an indefinite stop. Lauren soon turned from sorrow to confusion on who was calling out to him in that manner. However, Zachary knew who it was. It had been long since he had heard it, but he knew that voice very well.\n\nNot a second later, and the owner of that voice burst into the room with madness. Sure enough, the one standing at the doorway with pure rage in her eyes was none other than his mother.\n\n「Of all people…」\n\nIt was clear from her appearance that it had been a long time since she stepped out of the mansion. Even after seeing her son in his current condition, her eyes were still seething with hatred. Her hair was in a dire state as if it hadn't been touched in years. Some parts of her clothes were either torn or unclean. If one didn’t know any better, she would pass for a homeless person. Zachary wished he could look at her in disgust, but at the end of it all, this person was still his mother.\n\nWithout any need for introductions, she rushed in at him as Lauren backed away from her path in surprise.\n\n“You insolent little…,” she grit her teeth and spoke with anger, “Even after all what happened, you still didn’t learn and went along with your pathetic plans, and look where it got you. Do you even understand what happened to you?”\n\nShe threw her wrath onto him despite him already knowing the consequence of his actions, he was living in it. But she just had to rub salt on the wound, otherwise, it wouldn’t be his dear mother.\n\n“I’ve done everything to keep you safe—”\n\n“I KNOW!!!” Zachary snapped, “I know… I know what I did, I know everything you want to say to me so why don’t you go back home instead of rubbing it—”\n\n*SLAP*\n\n“Don’t. Ever. Talk. Back. To me.” She enunciated every word.\n\nWhen he realized what had happened, he was in shock.\n\nHis mother had slapped him in the face.\n\nWithout any hesitation, she simply just slapped him. And her face was still full of anger as if she hadn’t done anything yet. Yes, this was his mother, the same mother that was terrifyingly overprotective of him, the same mother that was barely tolerable in his eyes anymore, and the same mother that had gone lost in her mind. But never, in her life, did she ever lay a hand on him up until now.\n\n「Wha…?!」\n\nZachary felt lost. It was as if that slap had kicked him thousand times harder than it ever could have done into oblivion. He placed his hand on his cheek but then shivered back, he could feel his cheek burning, he could feel it pulsating from any slight touch.\n\n“Hey, what do you think you’re doing?!” Lauren could not bear to watch the scene without interfering anymore, she grabbed onto his mother’s arm and pulled her in her direction, “That’s your son you just hit right now! You know that?”\n\n“How I treat my child is none of your business!” His mother snapped back at her, “And who in the world are you?!”\n\n“I’m his friend!” Lauren was as equally angry as her.\n\n“Oh ho ho,” his mother laughed, “So you’re the little witch that got him into this mess?”\n\n「Oh no…」\n\nThe way they were talking to one another was not reassuring at all. It won’t be long till that argument would spiral out of control and someone would end up hurt.\n\nZachary didn’t want that.\n\nBut he couldn’t do anything about it, he still wasn’t out of the shock from the slap. All he could do was hold his hands against his ears and slid back under the pillow. There was no noise he could hide behind anymore, he could hear and see everything he didn’t want, so this was his only option in his eyes.\n\nAnd then came in the saving grace.\n\nTheir argument had caused a commotion that the hospital staff had taken notice of. So naturally, a few nurses and his doctor stepped in to take both Lauren and his mother out of the room, as it was clearly affecting him.\n\nLauren easily complied but things weren’t as easy with his mother.\n\n“Ma’am, can you please step outside?” The doctor tried being polite.\n\n“Get your hands off me!” Zachary’s mother pushed the doctor aside, “You can’t keep me away from my son!”\n\n「Just get out…」\n\n“Ma’am, you being here like this is affecting your son’s mental state,” said the doctor, “If you continue this, his mental condition will worsen.”\n\n“Mental what?! Huh?!!”\n\n「Just get out…」\n\n“Ma’am, can you please step… outside?” The doctor’s patience was running thin, “Or we will force you out.”\n\n「Just get out…」\n\n「Just get out…」\n\n「Just get out…」\n\n「Just get out…」\n\nBefore Zachary had realized, there was no one in the room.\n\nHe could still hear his mother shouting outside in the hallway, and with each shout, her voice got farther and farther. They were finally dragging her away.\n\nIt was only then that he felt relief seep back into his body.\n\n「Don’t come back…」\n\nDespite his thoughts saying otherwise, he wished she would come back. He knew that her behavior was the result of what happened to them. He knew that she had been suffering from within. He knew that in spite of her mad actions, she loved him. That was why he couldn’t hate her.\n\nShe was still his mother.",

He could do nothing but chuckle at how naive he was.\n\nThere was no right or wrong, that much was true, but only in a world that was completely free. However, in the reality he was living in, right and wrong were determined by the people that think they can govern their beliefs onto the world to satisfy themselves.\n\nHis mother might have been right, but who was to say she wasn’t? She might have been simply projecting her own fears onto him.\n\nZachary sat with his torso upright on the hospital bed in the room alone. There was no one in sight and the door was closed. However, it didn’t bother him somehow, and he was bothered by the fact that he wasn’t bothered.\n\nHe placed both his palms on his face and deeply sighed. He had grown tired of thinking altogether.\n\n*tick* *tick*\n\nA strange knock came from the window. He looked over to it in surprise to find that it was closed shut and with no one in sight. Perhaps it was a tree branch, the trees were pretty close to the window, almost blocking the warm light of the sunset.\n\nWith nothing to think about and nothing to do, he turned his head back to his front and simply just sat there. His eyes were completely devoid of emotion and full of melancholy as if he wasn’t quite conscious of the reality around him.\n\n*tick* *tick*\n\nThat knock came again.\n\nMoving to the corner of his eyes, he noticed a tree branch hanging down from the tree and was near the glass window. It seemed like the wind pushed it back and forth, so it was indeed a tree.\n\n「Just my luck…」\n\nIf the wind persisted and the branch continued to knock like that, he might not be able to sleep soundly come night.\n\nLooking back to his front, he gazed deeply into the wall with dazed eyes.\n\nHe felt his head slowly tilt downwards as if something was pushing it to drop. Following that movement, his eyelids grew heavier.\n\nHe shut his eyes…\n\n...but then he rolled it back up again.\n\nAnd so began the spiral of him fighting against sleep and his own mind. It was strange. He desired no sleep, yet his body acted like it was tired. Maybe sleep was what was best at the moment. If it could ease his thoughts, perhaps even erase them, then it wasn’t so bad.\n\nOnce again, the darkness of his eyelids covered his sight…\n\n...and once again, he opened them…\n\nThe same empty scenery of the wall existed.\n\nHe closed his eyes. He opened his eyes. He closed his eyes—\n\n“...!”\n\nAnd then he sprung his eyes wide open with fright.\n\nThe scenery was different.\n\nA figure was floating right in front of the wall.\n\nIt hid in the shadows, only remaining as a silhouette to the eyes. The wind blew from the side, pouring leaves into the room and that was when Zachary noticed that the window had opened. With another gush of the wind, more leaves flew and made way for the light to be directed at the shadows, revealing the figure in all its glory.\n\nIt took on the shape of a human, but it was neither human nor other. A force of nature would be a befitting name for it. It was terrifyingly tall, maybe two meters or more. It looked as if it was made out of natural wood, or as if a human shape was carved out of a tree and this was the result. From the elbows to the spine, to the knees, and to the ankles, there were vines crawling all over it. Strangely colored leaves covered most of its body as if it served as its clothes or armor, there were even leaves on top of its head acting as hair. As for the face, its eyes were open, there were five of them — almost lining up with those of an insect — but there was nothing within them but a red plate of wood, otherwise no one would have thought it had eyes. It was clear from the shape and certain facial features — if one could call it that — that the being was a male, or rather took on masculine form.\n\nIt seemed to be suspended in space but a large vine hung the creature from its leg.\n\n“—”\n\nZachary stared at the being with his mouth agape and his eyes deep in shock.\n\nHe blinked once, twice, thrice, but to no avail, the being was still there. It wasn’t a statue, it was moving, breathing like an actual living being. If he could laugh, he would, but this was not a laughing matter in the least.\n\n「I’ve gone mental!」\n\n“You’ve endured quite the endeavor.” The being spoke.\n\nIt had a deep and masculine voice, equally complimenting its appearance. The voice and the manner of speaking were somewhat elegant and refined, not something one would expect from such a creature.\n\nZachary looked down and held his hands against his head, “I’ve finally done it… I’ve finally hit rock-bottom.”\n\n“Why, what is a phoenix but ashes reborn?” The being spoke again.\n\n“Are you the grim reaper?” He scoffed, “Here to correct my death?”\n\n“Perhaps I am, perhaps I am not. Who is to say the only truth is the only truth?”\n\nThis must have been an illusion, there was no other way about it. It was an illusion in his mind, just like the door that moved. Somehow, it bore the look of a demonic creature yet spoke with a refined tone and sophisticated words. If that was not something straight out of Zachary’s deranged mind, then he did not know what was.\n\nStill, a question lingered in his mind, “The hell… the hell are you?”\n\nAlthough it was hanging from that vine upside down, it lowered, or in this case, raised its torso and moved its arm across its stomach as if it was kneeling in respect. “I am but a figment born from imagination, from the same myths and rumors I bestow upon this world as truth. That is forever the irony of our being as Strange Men.”\n\n「A figment of imagination…」\n\nThose words felt like the confirmation he needed but didn’t desire.\n\n“So you’re just a hallucination from my mind. I really am going crazy.”\n\n“Perhaps you see it as crazy, but I…,” the being spoke before it floated across the room and got slightly closer to Zachary, “I believe the right term is… enlightened! Only the enlightened, those with a vivid imagination, can see a being such as I. For I am as real as fairy tales can get it. And you, Zachary Ashworth, have vastly piqued my interest.”\n\n“That’s really not helping my case at all.” He tried to move away and avoid the being, but with the sorry state of his legs, he could only go so far. He closed his eyes and kept mumbling to himself. “(None of this is real. None of this is real. None of this is real. This isn’t real. This isn’t real. This isn’t real.)”\n\nThe being reached out its hands and lowered one of its vines to touch Zachary’s face. “Is this not real enough for you?”\n\nNot much of a surprise, Zachary felt the vine’s thorny strand slither across his face. It was eerie and too close for comfort, causing him to shiver. He tried his best to deny the being’s existence, even going as far as believing the touch was just being simulated from his mind.\n\n“How…? What?” He couldn’t find the words.\n\n“Have you not questioned yourself recently?” The being started, “Do you not feel anything odd going on within your life? Or something new? Things changing? People changing? And yet you, somehow, remain an unmoving cog in the machine of life. Do you not find it bizarre?”\n\nThe first thing that came to Zachary’s mind when he heard the word “bizarre” was the sudden surge of high spirits across town. But it didn’t stop there, he thought some more of what occurred during the past weeks. The mother that killed her own children, the rumored suicides, the sudden absence of students and teachers from the school, their return, and how some parts in the gloomy town turned to festivity. All of these occurrences happened out of nowhere and yet no one batted an eye to them, because why would they? They were just under the same influence of those enchanted rumors.\n\nThis could even mean that the appearance of Hye-mi Myung, his favorite author and idol, and the whole event to do with the writing competition was mere forgery among these events. After all, why would someone like Myung come to this secluded town of all places? But there was still another question on his mind, another doubt that he wouldn’t dare get out.\n\n「Could she be also… no, don’t think about it.」\n\nCould all of this have been the workings of that being?\n\nZachary grit his teeth, he did not want to face this truth, this reality that was swarming with fantasy worse than what a reality should be.\n\n“If you’re not…,” he didn’t want to say it, but he had to, “If you’re not in my mind, then what are you?”\n\nThe being narrowed its eyes in disappointment. “My my, am I still puzzling even after all this time? I’m devastated, my dear writer. Mere scandalmongers recognize me from the figure alone, yet you still fail to open your eyes to me. But alas, I shall keep my identity a mystery no longer.” It moved away from Zachary and near the window where its vines outreached, it stood with the warm twilight illuminating behind it, giving it a mystical aura, “A wish for faint light. A wish for greater blight. By the by, do you crave desire?”\n\n「Where did I hear these words…?!」\n\nZachary widened his eyes when he came to the realization.\n\n“Should you dream of an elusive age, my dear writer, then I, the Hanged Man, will be at your utmost service.”\n\nThe Hanged Man, the creature that granted wishes in Zachary’s old story. That was the identity of the being before him. The words that spoke of him were torn straight out of the paper and turned into reality.\n\n「This is a joke, right?」\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“You know, you can only play pretend for so long…,” said the Hanged Man.\n\nSeveral hours have passed since Zachary’s world had turned upside down. It was already nearing midnight. He would try to think of it as a dream and head back to sleep. He would close his eyes and attempt to do anything that would blow that creature away, but the Hanged Man was still there.\n\n“Gh…,” Zachary sprung himself up and sat upright to face the Hanged Man, “So you’re from my story and—”\n\n“Tsk tsk, you see, my dear writer, that is where you are wrong. I’m not from your story,” the Hanged Man explained, “You simply allowed me to take part in yours, just like everyone else who once wrote about me. I’ve existed for over five hundred years.”\n\n“Five hundred years?! Where the hell are you from?”\n\n“Why, I came from the distant land of Neverland, what else?”\n\n“Neverland?!” He raised an eyebrow.\n\nAs if the Hanged Man’s presence wasn’t odd enough, now he was claiming to be from a mystical land, and not just any land, it was one that was brought about from pure imagination and dreams. There was no such place as a Neverland. It was only a myth stuck in fairy tales that did not exist. And yet… the creature that identified himself as the Hanged Man was right before him.\n\n“I suppose your ignorance is… predictable,” the Hanged Man chuckled, “Neverland is the world that bridges your reality with our fables. It’s a world where the written words are enchanted, where writers like you can blossom and cultivate our fantasies into something more. Imagine a world where your ink is the root of reality. You can write anything and everything on anything anywhere at any time. A world filled with writers and authors of all kinds with the sole purpose of bettering the world with their magic.”\n\nThe way everything was said and phrased made it sound insane and delusional, but they were coming from a man formed out of wood and leaves instead of normal skin, a man who was hanging from the ceiling at all times, no less.\n\nSomehow, it all piqued Zachary’s interest. He was willing to indulge in this fantasy a little further, even if he was losing his mind or lost in a dream. There was, however, a question that was still on his mind.\n\n“Writers like me? Authors?!”\n\n“Precisely!” The Hanged Man clapped his hands together before pointing out another thing, “But not any author, just those enlightened with the gift of great imagination. They wield their tools with great power to cast their magic and enchanted words everywhere.”\n\n“And I… I am one?!”\n\n“Why else can you see me?”\n\n“Oh, I don’t know, perhaps I’m out of my goddamn mind.”\n\nAs much as Zachary would like to believe the creature’s words — anyone would love a little fantasy in their life — as much as his thoughts were warning him of falling down to this insanity.\n\n“Still close-minded, I see,” the Hanged Man inched closer to Zachary and placed the tip of his finger on his forehead, “How about a short trip to the beyond?”\n\nWith one touch from the Hanged Man’s fingertips, Zachary suddenly felt himself being pushed away at an incredible speed as if something was pulling him from the back through a portal. The scenery before him changed a thousand times as if he was on a trip through the boundless space of the universe. He couldn’t keep up with the rush, the flickering lights almost blinded him, and yet he was still conscious. Somehow, the Hanged Man was still right in front of him with his finger on his forehead.\n\nAnd then… darkness.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, Zachary was met with an overtop scenery of a large city at night.\n\nThe city’s architecture was odd, fantastical — straight out of the impossibilities of imagination. It was warmly lit by a thousand lights across its streets and buildings, giving it a tinge of gold that would sparkle the onlookers no matter where they went. There was this touch of antiquity to it, as if it was a place locked in time and yet still progressed further than ever before. Buildings were structured in a compound form, coating it with what seemed to be a Victorian ornament.\n\nIt was an unbelievable and mesmerizing sight.\n\nZachary could not believe his eyes, but this was only in the beginning.\n\nA moment later, something flew past Zachary and almost knocked him away. It was a carriage, several of them, running, or in this case, flying with giant birds at the helm. However, this wasn’t all. Following those carriages, were a ton of winged mythical creatures that the words could not describe. Each one varied in size and shape, some looked humanoid, some were just right out of someone’s fever dream.\n\nIf you stumble upon this narrative on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\n\nRight after them, a human passed by Zachary, who seemed to be hovering on top of gold clouds and dust that dictated his flight like there was no problem.\n\nAll of these people, airborne vehicles, and creatures were all flying towards the city.\n\n「Flying?!」\n\nThat was when reality hit Zachary.\n\nBy some miracle or another, he was floating in the air across the city. He immediately turned his head upwards to be met by the Hanged Man who was carrying him through the whole trip.\n\nZachary felt a shortness of breath as he panicked, “Why are we in the air?!!!”\n\n“Why, to get the best view, what else,” the Hanged Man replied.\n\nThey had to shout to be able to hear one another among the noise, be it the noise of the wind rushing against them, the loud cheers of the crowd down in the city, or the cries of the creatures that flew by and the flutter of their wings that made waves in the air.\n\n“What is this place?!” Zachary narrowed his eyes as he struggled to see from the gushes of wind.\n\n“I told you, didn’t I?” The Hanged Man laughed, “Neverland. Beautiful, isn’t it?”\n\n“G-Get me down, I suffer from air-sickness.”\n\n“My dear writer, you were doing just fine a few moments ago. Just forget everything and admire the scenery.”\n\n“I said, let me down!!!”\n\n“Oh well, as you wish.”\n\nTrue to his exact words, the Hanged Man let go of his arms, setting him loose in the air and leaving him to fall down to the ground.\n\nWhen Zachary realized what had happened to him, he was already screaming at the top of his lungs from panic. The wind rushed against his body even harder than before from how fast he was falling. He could see the grounds of the city inching closer and closer. Blinded by fear, he immediately closed his eyes to ready himself for impact.\n\nBut… the impact never came.\n\nOpening his eyes once again, he found himself back in the air above the city. Looking up, he saw the Hanged Man looking at him with a smug smile on his face.\n\n“You said “let me down,” so I let you down, as simple as that.” The Hanged Man offered his excuse.\n\n“Not in a goddamn literal sense!”\n\nAs they were much closer to the city now, they were able to get a better look at it. An endless amount of people filled the concrete streets, making no path for vehicles to pass. They seemed to be celebrating something from how loud their cheers were and how boisterous they all were.\n\nHowever, these people weren’t just humans. There were other kinds that were never before seen in reality, and only in fiction. Some were like the humanoid flying creatures. Some seemed to be humans with certain animal features. Others were really just sentient animals. Even elves, with their well-known pointed ears, existed, and dwarfs that were shorter than by a magnificent length.\n\nDespite that difference in race, they all danced in unison.\n\n「They look so happy.」\n\nIt felt as if he was pulled out of reality from that little monotonous hospital room and thrown into the bright festivity of a medieval fantasy novel.\n\n“Wait…”\n\n「Bright?!」\n\nZachary widened his eyes.\n\nThe world before him, all of it, was all bright and colorful. Not a single object or place was covered in that colorless shade he was forced to always see. This could never be real, he thought. Even in his wildest dreams, he couldn’t imagine a real color within them. And yet this one, this world presented itself to him with all its shine and glory. It was amazing.\n\n“This is…”\n\nBut before he could utter another word, the world turned dark once again.\n\n“...!”\n\nAs the curtains of his eyelids lifted, Zachary found himself back at the hospital bed in the same colorless room. For a moment, he thought that all of that was simply a dream, that he had awoken from a long dream. But then there he was: the Hanged Man, dangling from the ceiling in front of him as he had been for the past hours.\n\n「B-But that world…」\n\n“It wasn’t real?!” He looked at the Hanged Man with a sorrowful expression.\n\n“What? You really expected me to fly without my vines?” The Hanged Man moved along with his vines next to him, “But to answer your question, yes and no. That was a scene out of my own memory and experiences. What you saw was a festival held in the very mystical land of Neverland.”\n\n“Gah…!”\n\nZachary rubbed his hands against his head. His thoughts were in complete disarray. That colorful world seemed so real, and yet it wasn’t. Or perhaps it was, according to the Hanged Man’s words. But was the Hanged Man ever really real? These were the types of questions riddling his mind.\n\nSo this was either of two things, all of it was real, or he had fallen asleep and delved deep into the depths of his dreams.\n\n“By the Thousand Lords of the Night, you are a tough nut crack,” the Hanged Man placed his hand on his face and then let one of his vines scratch his head for him as if he was in deep thought about another solution. And indeed, he found a solution, “Perhaps this ought to convince you enough.”\n\nHe calmly lowered down a few of his vines onto the bed before moving over and removing the blanket entirely off Zachary.\n\n“Wait, what are you doing?”\n\nHe felt a strange intent from the Hanged Man, but he couldn’t move.\n\nThe Hanged Man then proceeded to lower more vines onto Zachary’s legs, which were both encased in large casts to cover the injuries he had received — despite him losing the nerves and the overall feeling of his legs. The vines slowly crawled across his legs and attempted to entangle themselves before they were wrapped entirely around both legs with force. Yet still, Zachary could feel nothing.\n\nAnd then…\n\n“There was once a young man…,” the Hanged Man began chanting, “Broken without repair, he sought to empty his mind of despair. A life of silence and solitude was all that he desired. But come the night of the moon, and soon the light of the evergreen will avert the terrible fate, for another tale awaited at the end of the gate.”\n\nJust as the words of the chant said over and over, the vines surrounding Zachary’s legs began to glow, and with them, his legs shone as well. It was a sight not for the words to describe — and not for the eyes either, Zachary felt a burning sensation in his eyes as the light came through before he shut them completely.\n\nDespite feeling nothing in his legs a few seconds ago, Zachary felt a strange relief, as if his legs had been trapped under something for so long, and only now, were they starting to be released from the tension.\n\n“...!”\n\nThe fact that he was able to somewhat feel his legs and not react to them came as a surprise to him. He still had his eyes closed to avert his gaze from the light, so he had no idea what was going on. Each second that passed gave him a sense of alleviation as if the casts in his legs were being slowly unwrapped.\n\n“Now, try it,” the Hanged Man spoke.\n\nAfter opening his eyes, Zachary noticed that everything stayed relatively the same. His legs were still wrapped in the casts. The Hanged Man was still in his place. There was no light. For something as grand as healing someone’s broken body part, he expected to see and feel something more than this.\n\n“Nothing’s chang—”\n\nBut then Zachary felt his legs actually move when he tried to. When he came to, he saw his legs were tilted to the right, where he had intended to move them.\n\n「That’s impossible!」\n\nA look of utter disbelief was plastered on his face almost immediately.\n\nHe wanted to move his legs to the left, they moved to the left. He wanted to move them to the right again, they moved to the right again. He wanted to move them upwards, they moved upwards.\n\nEven now the weight of the cast felt heavier in his leg. He could feel the cast wrapped around his legs.\n\nBut most importantly of all, he could feel his legs.\n\n“I… I-I don’t understand,” he looked at the Hanged Man with his mouth agape.\n\nSeeing him finally believing in his magic, the Hanged Man only smiled and breathed out a sigh of satisfaction.\n\nA being, out of tales of old, had healed his broken legs. This was no illusion. It wasn’t something that his mind could easily come up with, it wasn’t just a feeling or sense anymore.\n\nIt was a miracle, one that only belonged to the age of miracles and fairy tales.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“So what?” Zachary was past the point of disbelief and into the point of questioning, “You’re telling me I can escape reality and just live happily in that fantasy?”\n\nThis man, creature, or whatever being he was called had done the impossible. But because of that, Zachary had more of a reason now to be wary of that creature. If such fantasy as magical worlds existed, then there were still a lot of things to be questioned before one could just throw themselves into it recklessly.\n\n“Escape reality? Yes. But live happily in fantasy? I never said that fantasy is always as bright as it seems,” said the Hanged Man, “But fear not, it is certainly brighter than whatever you’re living in now. Furthermore, you have the gift of enlightenment. You have my word.”\n\n“That's the problem,” Zachary expressed his worry, “Your words are too vague to be trusted. And what the hell is this enlight—”\n\nBefore he could finish his words, he heard two knocks coming from the door. This time, it wasn’t a hallucination, as the Hanged Man heard it too and turned toward the door — or perhaps it was for that matter.\n\nThe fact was, there was someone about to enter the room, and, illusion or not, the Hanged Man was still right here, hanging from the ceiling like nothing’s wrong.\n\n“(G-Get outta here… Hide somewhere.)”\n\nZachary wanted to hide this mysterious creature. It wasn’t for the creature’s safety, it was to prevent frightening whoever was going to enter. He might have accepted the Hanged Man’s existence, even though he still struggles to comprehend him in his entirety, but who knew how others were going to take it? It wasn’t every day that one could easily spot a two-meter-tall humanoid tree creature hanging from the ceiling like it was nothing.\n\nDespite his pleas, the Hanged Man did not move.\n\nAnd it was already too late, the door had opened.\n\n「Shit!」\n\nStanding in the doorway was his doctor along with three men dressed in what seemed like military suits, there was no doubt they were part of the watchmen.\n\n“Ah, I see you’re wide awake now, Mr. Ashworth,” the doctor chuckled, “I tried stopping by half an hour ago but you were deep in sleep.”\n\n「Must have been when I was pretending to.」\n\n“Well, anyway,” the doctor stepped aside to let the other three men walk into the room, “These gentlemen are from the military police.”\n\n“Good Evening,” one of the men grabbed a seat and sat next to his bed, “It’s good to see your recovery is going well, Mr. Ashworth. We are currently investigating the accident and hope that you could answer some of our concerned questions — if that’s not a bother to you, of course.”\n\n“Uh…,” Zachary looked at all the men in the room before eying the Hanged Man a look of astonishment, who was hanging from the ceiling just right beside him, clearly visible to everyone. Yet barely anyone paid heed to him as if he wasn’t there. “Okay?”\n\n「They can’t see him?」\n\n“Heh, I told you, only those who are enlightened can see me,” the Hanged Man laughed. His laugh was something maniacal, befitting of a twisted villain, and completely contradicting his elegant speech.\n\nThe man asking him questions cleared his throat, “This is just basic protocol, I’m going to ask you some very basic questions. So just go along with it, even if they’re a little absurd.”\n\n“O-Of course,” Zachary was somewhat worried, especially by the smile that was still persisting on the Hanged Man’s wooden face.\n\n“Great!” The man adjusted the chair to sit more comfortably and then pulled out a notebook, “First off, are you fully aware of your rights?”\n\n“(I guess…) Y-Yes!”\n\n“Alright then. What’s your full name?”\n\n“N-Name?!” He was confused before he remembered the man telling him to just answer the questions, “Oh, Zachary “Edward” Ashworth…”\n\nThe man wrote something in the notebook, “Age?”\n\n“Turned eighteen last July.”\n\n“Where do you go for school?”\n\n“Everille.”\n\n“Did you or did you not jump willingly in front of the truck?”\n\n“Huh?!” Zachary was baffled for a moment. The way that question was structured seemed to indicate that they were suspecting him of suicide. Even then, the watchmen shouldn’t be the ones asking these questions. “N-No, I did not!”\n\n“Did not what?”\n\nHe sighed, “I did not jump willingly in front of the truck.”\n\n“What were you doing there in the afternoon of the twenty-second of September?”\n\n「What?! Shouldn’t this have come before the other question?」\n\n“...” Zachary did not know how to answer. He didn’t know how the “protocol” went but they seemed to delve into very personal questions. “I was—”\n\nJust as he was about to answer, he noticed the Hanged Man in the corner of his eye. He had moved his location and was now hanging from the ceiling between the other two men. At first, he was making a mockery out of them since they couldn’t see him — surprisingly carefree for a creature like him — but now he was looking at Zachary with his eyes wide open, shaking his head in dismay.\n\n“Don’t tell them…,” said the Hanged Man.\n\nZachary ignored him, “I was at the convention hall.”\n\n“I see…,” the man proceeded to write down something in his notebook again, “Any hobbies?”\n\nHe looked at the Hanged Man, and once again, he was shaking his head, urging him to deny their questions.\n\n“I… I like to write… to write stories.” He chuckled.\n\n“Interesting…,” the man wrote in the notebook, “You recently submitted this short story to the Melanvale Writing Contest. Its contents were… interesting, to say the least. Care to shed some light?”\n\nAt this moment, Zachary came to understand the Hanged Man’s warnings. Something was off about them, and whenever something was off…\n\n「It’s that hanged bastard’s doing, isn’t it?」\n\n“Don’t focus such a gaze upon me. I am not involved with any of this.” The Hanged Man replied as if he had read his thoughts when in reality, he noticed his frustration and figured it out.\n\nZachary was surprised. If this wasn’t the work of the Hanged Man, then these watchmen were acting out on their own accord. But why, of all things, would they be interested in his short story? It was just a story written by a kid for a contest. He couldn’t even remember what he had written from how quickly he finished it.\n\n“Well,” the man was aware of Zachary’s lack of answers, “Perhaps I could remind you. You mentioned something called “Elysium’s Gate,” ring any bell?”\n\n“Don’t tell them!” The Hanged Man said.\n\n“I… I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He tried to answer, “That wasn’t me.”\n\nThat was the truth, for the most part. He did not remember writing anything that the man had mentioned.\n\nBut the man didn’t believe him, “Are you sure about that? Your name is listed as the author, you know that, right?”\n\n「Shit!」\n\nPanic was plastered all over Zachary’s face, both from knowing that he was lying and from the fact he still had no idea what the man was talking about. However, in the watchmen’s eyes, this was the face of a culprit caught in his transparent lie.\n\n“Back into a corner, eh,” the Hanged Man sighed, “Well, I’ve got just the solution for you, my dear writer.”\n\nHe cracked his fingers before floating back near Zachary.\n\nOut of nowhere, vines crawled in from the window wrapped around a pen and an old parchment paper through them. The Hanged Man cleared his throat, before itching the vines closer to Zachary for him to see.\n\n“Under the pledge of a thousand lords of the night,” he snapped a finger, “Do you, dear writer, given the circumstance of your current predicament and other queries, accept the authorization of this contract?”\n\n「What?!」\n\nTrying not to garner much attention to the people around him, Zachary eyed the Hanged Man a quick look of confusion. Between the watchmen’s absurd claims about his novel (a kid’s short story, no less) and the Hanged Man’s bizarre string of words dumped together on him like an awful shanty by a drunk in a pub, his mind was in a state of chaos. If he were pushed some more to the brink, he could most likely end up doing something that wasn’t in his favor.\n\n“Approve the contract with me, and I will personally rid you of these delusional buffoons in mere seconds. It's as easy as that.”\n\n「What even is this contract?」\n\nAll of a sudden, the man got off the chair and slammed his fist into Zachary’s bed. “Listen here, you little shit!” the man’s tone had completely shifted.\n\nFollowing that action, the other two men walked to the door and escorted the doctor away, who was in clear shock upon seeing the man’s abrupt reaction. Assuming that the doctor had any authority, he would have cleared these men out immediately for disturbing his patient, but when did anyone have authority here?\n\n“I won’t let you get out of this god damned hospital bed until you answer my questions. Do I make myself clear?” The man’s eyes were entirely bloodshot, it was as if he had turned into a completely different person.\n\n“...I…,” Zachary didn’t know what to say. He was running out of options, and none of them provided him with a clear answer.\n\n“We don’t have the luxury of time here,” the Hanged Man commented with a still smile on his face. “They’ll take you in, you know, whether you tell them the truth or not. But then again, the only truth is not the only truth. They’ll make whatever sob tale fits their incentives.”\n\nThe man grabbed onto Zachary’s chin, a little lower, and he could possibly choke him, “My patience is running thin, and so is theirs.”\n\n「What the hell is happening to me?」\n\n“Don’t you see?” The Hanged Man sneered, “You’re just a stepping stone to them, a triviality, an error they wish to correct. Such is this world you tried to reject, but you can run away from it no longer.”\n\n「Who are these guys? Why is this happening to me? Why is it only me? Am I not supposed to just live and have what I want? This all has to be a joke, right? Just a bad dream in my delusional mind. I’ve read so many of these stories I’ve dropped myself into one, yeah, that’s it. It’s just a story in my dream.」\n\n“You don’t start talking, and the accident will start having severe side effects,” the man tightened his grip around Zachary’s neck.\n\n「But I-I don’t want any part in this, I-I never wanted any of anything. But nothing’s been going right for me ever… I was the one who dragged myself into this, ever since the accident. If I just didn’t get myself in it… I would’ve been fine. I wouldn’t be imagining this monstrosity of a man, these guys wouldn’t be here.」\n\n“...”\n\n「That’s right! I have no place in this world anymore. I’m nothing special, after all.」\n\n“Do you cloud your own mind as a pastime?” The Hanged Man spoke, disappointed by Zachary’s thoughts, “Excuse my intrusion, but do you berate yourself so much for no reason just to live? Or is it because they told you?”\n\n“Wha…?!”\n\n“You know what I’m talking about. Men like them, families like yours… and a girl like the one outside, shaping your heart into whatever they desire, tricking you into thinking you don’t have one. They force their problems onto you and make you fail just to feel better about themselves.”\n\n“What are you trying to imply?”\n\n“Who the hell is he talking to?” The other men started to notice.\n\n“See, I told you the boy was insane,” another one of the men said, “You saw what he wrote, Adam, so stop wasting time and get it over with.”\n\n“You know what I mean,” said the Hanged Man, “You let them all guide you by their whims with no regard to you, and yet you’re still kind to them. These men beating you for their own satisfaction, only to get a promotion out of it. Your family deeming you as an outcast and mentally unstable just to ignore their own dysfunction. That girl dragging along with her schemes, giving you false hope, only to torture you with her victory just to feel much better about herself.”\n\n“That’s not true…”\n\n“And let’s not forget the biggest contributor,” the Hanged Man snickered, “Your dear old father… left his young boy all alone just because he didn’t want him to be special. He could not stand the succession of a boy who would show him all his failures. He feared your potential so much he was willing to give up his life on it and show you just so you would fear the thought of ever reaching it. Didn’t you ever find it a little odd how you, a child, were the first one to discover—”\n\n“No!!!”\n\n“Come on now,” the Hanged Man tried to elaborate, “You’re smarter than this. Don’t feign ignorance in front of me. After all, all that I know about you was just gathered from your own mind right now. You’re a young man with great ambition, or have you forgotten what you’ve longed for as a child?”\n\nZachary’s eyes widened.\n\n“No… that can’t be…”\n\n「That’s right…」\n\nIt was a dream, the longest dream.",

Naturally, he returned to discuss it with his family, like he would about his school day every day whenever they gathered around the dinner table, like any other family.\n\nHis mother chuckled and looked at him with surprise,\n\nHe followed up with excitement.\n\nBeing a child who was only surrounded by fantasies of children’s picture books at the time, he had once read a book that spoke about the life of a river that always moved, taking anyone and everyone everywhere it went. It was a fascinating thing to a kid like him, who was stuck in his room all the time. In his eyes, that river was free, it always had a purpose to move, as opposed to him..\n\nThat was his only dream then — his first and only dream.\n\nHowever…\n\nhis father interrupted, does come to a stop, it’s called a waterfall. And no one wants to be like the waterfall, you know why that is?>\n\nHis father looked at him with stern eyes,\n\nThat was how his father was, a man who opposed the slightest bit of dreams.\n\nBut Zachary smiled and continued his dream.\n\nHe told him once.\n\nIt was what his father believed, a belief born out of inconvenience.\n\nFaced by failure upon failure, he believed that wants were just the product of illusion. Wanting was but a choice, that was what differentiated it from the needs, a privilege that didn’t exist. There was no need for a child’s privilege in this harsh world, he would say. A child could choose to have a new toy or a new game but they couldn’t choose to need food. He was a simple man, and so he lived by those simple rules. They were painful, at times, but they granted him a sustainable life.\n\nWhen his mother, a woman who was born into a wealthy family, free of trouble, came to live a life of her own with his father at the height of her youth, she struggled. But, with time, she accepted that these tribulations were necessary to understand the reality that was kept from her all her sheltered life. Call it blind love or ignorance, it was the choice she took when she married his father, despite most of her family opposing them.\n\nAnd so, Zachary was born into this small family.\n\nAs a child, he would always see other children flock to the playgrounds with their joy but he could never attain that so-called “privilege” like them because he was told he had “enough.” Looking at a toy car behind a glass wall was like staring at a diamond in a museum that was only there for admiration. If he were to ever think of opening his mouth, he would be hit with words; words that were coated in a facade of wisdom but were sharper than a knife. What joy would a toy car bring but mere moments of fantasy that led to nothing? That car wouldn’t help the child, it wouldn’t feed him. It would bring him fun, yes, but he would keep wanting for more. That child would grow up with the desire for greed only to attain sorrow.\n\nDesire was of nothing but self-destructive nature.\n\nEncased within those ideals of deluded content, he withdrew to the world of books, never to bother anyone or desire anything more than what he already had. One book after the other, he learned — more than he ever could in that sorry excuse of a school he enrolled in at the time — with learning came knowledge, and with knowledge came desire. Be that as it may, he still kept to himself, he believed he was satisfied.\n\nHowever, his knowledge could not hide.\n\nIt was a day, like any other, when his mother was called into his school. She went there expecting her child had been misbehaving, or perhaps failing his test, but the reality was the complete opposite. His teacher sang praises about him and his excellent knowledge, they believed he would have a chance at a prestigious school someday.\n\nComing to that revelation, his mother started to believe in him as well. For a parent to have a gifted child like that and not aid them, they would be rejecting his right. If it were anything for her child, she had to do something.\n\nBut his father thought otherwise.\n\nThus began the constant feud between his parents, be it in the morning at breakfast, in the afternoon when they’re having lunch, in the evening during dinner, or even at night before they went to bed. One saw his child in his image and opposed his only privilege, and the other saw her child for who he truly was and desired for him to be the greatest.\n\nHis father was always in denial.\n\nAnd his mother would try to find a solution.\n\nZachary always hid in his room whenever they started arguing. He would try to distract himself from their yelling with his books. His books were everything he had for safety, he could drown himself within them and let the river of the words stir his mind and imagination far away from all the quarrels.\n\nEven after three years, that was still his desire, his dream, to be free like a river, constantly moving in a stream.\n\nSupport the creativity of authors by visiting Royal Road for this novel and more.\n\nBut then… he heard a scream.\n\nIt was a scream from his mother, after yet another fight with his father. Frightened by what he had heard, he rushed out of his room to see what had happened, only to be met by his father right in front of him. His father demanded that he return back to his room.\n\nZachary was afraid. He listened to his words.\n\nBut even then, he saw his mother (from the little gap in the door) on the ground with her hands covering her face, trying to suppress her scream of agony — and beside her was a small kettle, still emitting smoke from within.\n\nFor an eleven-year-old, he still knew the truth of what was going on… and for that same reason, he was scared.\n\nHe could not get a wink of sleep that night. Even after his parents returned and he heard the sound of his mother’s voice seemingly fine, he still could not sleep. He only listened to the voice of his father mumbling something over and over right outside his room.\n\nThey can act all high and mighty as much as they want. I’m here to make sure we survive! If that god damned kid keeps this us it’ll be the end of me and if they can’t understand then so be it.>\n\nFrom that day on, things changed.\n\nHis parents’ arguments lessened with each passing day. And come night, their arguments were almost non-existent. Instead, Zachary would hear a few loud remarks from his father followed by several whimpers from his mother, but they weren’t ones from pain or tears, it was something else that he couldn’t comprehend at the time.\n\nHis mother had changed.\n\nOther than the burn mark that was on her face, her attitude toward him and his father had completely changed. She was treating his father, whom she previously had constant fighting with, with warmth and love. As for Zachary, whom she had considered to be the light of her life and sought to protect, she treated him with silence and cold gazes. He and his father had switched positions. It wasn’t out of fear; fear that his father would turn on her again; it was all by her free will.\n\nShe had turned completely against him.\n\nNaturally, he wasn’t transferred to another school.\n\nBut he still smiled with his dream still on his mind, a childish dream, the only thing left to keep him through that agony of life.\n\nHis father was still desperate to wake him up from that dream, that fantasy. He needed to show him the true reality, that was what he would constantly say. No matter what his father did, or what his mother attempted to do, there was nothing that was going to change him.\n\n…\n\nAnd then one night, his mother called out to him.\n\nShe sat on the couch out in the living room, with her head and arms resting on her thighs. For a moment, he thought he heard her weeping. But when Zachary approached her, she quickly raised her head and wiped her face. Even though the burn marks covered most of her face, her eyes appeared to be slightly swollen.\n\nHe was worried his father might have done something again to his mother.\n\nshe looked at him with a smile, a smile that has been long gone and one that he greatly missed.\n\nHer voice was slightly different and seemed to remind him of the old days when she treated him with warmth.\n\nLike the obedient little son he was when it came to his mother, he listened to her words and obeyed them. If there was something wrong with his mother, then there was nothing he could do as he was. He needed an adult, even if that meant that adult was his father and someone he feared.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“And so she led you down that hallway so goody-two-shoes Zach could get a taste of reality,” said the Hanged Man as he recited what Zachary was remembering.\n\nThey remained in this void between reality and his memories, looking at everything unfolding from afar, like spectators who could do nothing but watch.\n\n“No…, t-that not…” Zachary held his hands against his head.\n\n“Oh come on, you didn’t actually think your mother was still there?” The Hanged Man laughed, “I’d say your father did a rather fine job of turning her into his little puppet, broken beyond repair.”\n\n“...”\n\n“And then…?” The Hanged Man tilted his head with a smile still on his face, “…What happened…? Come on, you can do it.”\n\n“No, no, it wasn’t real,” he backed away, “That was a dream. Just a hallucination.”\n\n“Or perhaps a memory locked deep, deep, deep in your mind? You wouldn’t know with someone who can easily shun everyone out for believing they were not worthy of his time. So why not repress a memory?”\n\n“…”\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nAnd then…\n\nZachary found himself standing in front of the door to his father’s office.\n\nBut… he couldn’t step in.\n\nThere was something pushing him back, several, in fact: the pressure and weight that kept his legs from moving off the ground, the shivers throughout his body, the ache in his heart, the shortness of his breath, the stutters holding back his tongue, and the throb in his eyes.\n\nHe wondered, when did he ever feel terrified? And terrified of what? A door?\n\nIt was tall, taller than ever before, almost to a terrifying degree. The wood seemed like it was decaying bit by bit as the paint it was coated with came off. The light under the door was flickering.\n\nIt was just a door. Nothing more. Nothing less.\n\nHe took a deep breath before he reached for the knob and turned it, unlocking the door.\n\n*creaaaaaaaaaak*\n\nStill holding onto the knob, he moved forward and pushed the door with all his might. The door creaked louder than before, piercing through his ears and sending shivers down his spine.\n\na d...?!>\n\nHis body dangled across the room from the rope wrapped around his neck like a puppet from a string. His petrified face emerged underneath the beam of the flickering lightbulb. His eyes were inflamed with blood, yet devoid of life all the same.\n\nThe man that was his father had taken his own life.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“A fitting end to the man fueled with envy at his own son.”\n\nThe Hanged Man raised his arms in the air, as the curtains rolled down and the scene of reality was lifted back up again.\n\nBoth of them were back in the hospital room — as a matter of fact, they never left. The watchmen were still in the room, guarding the door, and keeping anyone outside from entering. The man that attempted to choke him was still in the same position, holding onto Zachary’s neck and slowly tightened his grip.\n\nHowever, being choked to death was the least of Zachary’s concerns after he recalled his dreadful childhood memories back.\n\n“What a sad man he was,” the Hanged Man gave off a concerned and surprised expression, “To think he’d take his own life just to traumatize his own son.”\n\n“That’s a lie…”\n\n「No… I’ve always known.」\n\n“Yes, yes. Absolutely Correct!” The Hanged Man hailed him with applause and spiraled across the ceiling as if he was dancing, “You’re getting close! So so so so close! You always knew,” he deepened the tone of his voice, “You’ve always known how to read between the lines…”\n\n“...”\n\n“Hey, kid,” the man, who was completely oblivious to the fact there was a floating tree creature invisible to his eyes, shook Zachary from his neck, “If you don’t answer, I’ll really do it. You really wanna lose your life over some petty squabble?”\n\nBut Zachary did not care.\n\nHe gazed into the abyss, wishing for it to look back at him and take him away from this world once and for all.\n\nIf that was the truth of his father, then that same truth was correct about everyone else. Everyone tried to use him for their own inconvenience. These men, his father, his mother, his family… and even Lauren, they all wore masks of virtue with the claim to help when all they really sought was to harm him at his most vulnerable.\n\n“No, that can’t be true…,” He was still in denial.\n\n“Oh, don’t reject it,” the Hanged Man crawled right next to his ear, “Embrace it!”\n\n“But why…?”\n\n“Don’t you get it?” The Hanged Man fluttered his arms at opposite sides, “All this pain. All this suffering. They all came from people who thrived on the torment of others. It was never your fault. They looked down on you, they stepped on you, just because they knew they couldn’t be like you.”\n\nZachary felt deep pain and sorrow in his heart, and it was all visible on his face.\n\n“Yes, yes,” the Hanged Man was delighted to fuel that pain within Zachary, “You know what these people are? Tyrants! As simple as that. And tyrants deserve to be stomped!”\n\n“...”\n\n“It’s not your fault,” the Hanged Man twirled his hand, causing the vines to slither around Zachary’s shoulder, before he placed his hand on his back to calm him, “You were just born in a world where they hated the special.”\n\n「But if the whole world is like that, then what’s the…」\n\nAll of a sudden, the world turned blurry in Zachary’s eyes as he felt his consciousness slip away. His mind had finally grasped the fact that he was being choked to death. He grit his teeth in frustration, and grabbed onto the man’s arm, trying to push him away, but the man wouldn’t budge. The man was too stiff, too strong for his waning strength.\n\n“Oh no, don’t die on me yet, lad,” the Hanged Man grimaced and angled his head to the other side, before snapping his fingers and bringing about parchment paper from dust, “Sign the contract with me, and your wish, any wish, is my command.”\n\n“Gh…,” Zachary struggled for breath.\n\nIf he signed the contract, then he would be able to attain the authority of the Hanged Man’s incredible powers, but only as commands. The power wouldn’t be truly his in the end. Even after showing him all those memories and trying to build up his resolve, there were so many things that the Hanged Man had left out, so many things that were still vague to him. Time was running but Zachary could do nothing but ponder the many questions on his mind.\n\n“So what do you say?” The Hanged Man inched closer to him as he held the contract in one hand, and a quill in the other.\n\n“I…”",

He coughed multiple times as he placed his hand on the bed to help balance himself from losing consciousness. He felt absolute relief after escaping the clutches of death.\n\nBut the men were not so happy.\n\n“Go on, catch your breath,” the man straightened his suit as he stood up, “Think carefully about your future, kid. If you don’t want a crushed windpipe then you better… cooperate next time.”\n\nThe boy seemed to be in an awful physical state, so he wasn’t going anywhere — not with those broken legs. They left him hanging onto his life on the bed, still coughing and gasping for air, and decided to collect themselves and leave for the time being.\n\nWalking out of the hospital room, they were met by the busy ambience of the hospital’s hallways, crawling with staff members everywhere.\n\nThe men felt somewhat relieved after they were able to leave the bizarre tension of that boy’s room behind. Attempting to suffocate a kid for questioning was jarring, even for professionals like them. He was a valuable asset to them, they knew better than to be reckless like some run-of-the-mill thugs.\n\nIt was surprising how he had survived the man’s grip that entire time. However, the man did not exactly want to kill him, both for the information he held and for the fact that he was a powerless kid. Even though he stared him down with the intention of taking his life if he refused to answer his questions, he still had a bit of sympathy.\n\nBut what could they do? They were men following orders. They were official watchmen sent by the military police, after all.\n\n“So… what now?” One of the men wondered.\n\nThey spoke to one another as they all walked together in unison. They strolled through the hallways, breaking the crowds with their strict formation.\n\n“Nothing in particular. Report back to base and wait,” said another man, Adam, who was the one previously questioning the boy (and who seemed to be the leader among them).\n\nAnother came to his side and spoke, “I honestly think it’s quite better this way. Trust me, something’s off about all this. We were already crossing red lines by coming here to the boy, you know what family he comes from.”\n\n“True, but they seem to be pretty disconnected from one another. You saw how his mother was earlier today. Any more of what she did and they would have called for us to take her in and that certainly wouldn’t have ended nicely.”\n\n“But we can’t be too hasty. You never know with chinless wonders like them, they’d be happy to rip you off for all you have if they had the chance.”\n\nDespite being aided by the military police, they could not do entirely as they pleased. After all, there was not a thing in this world a family of nobility could not touch. If they ever so desired, they could bring down the whole system.\n\nThat was how fractured the world had become after the war.\n\n“I don’t know what the chief is thinking,” one of them wiped the sweat off his forehead, feeling like they had almost stepped on a landmine back there.\n\n“It’s all that priest’s doing!” Adam spoke with dismay.\n\n“Oh right, that man… He’s from another country, correct? He certainly doesn’t look like a native here.”\n\n“I heard he was trying to negotiate and establish connections here for the “betterment” of his country. But who in their right man comes to the ends of the fucking world for a plan of negotiation?” The man was irritated by just mentioning him, “Why is he so interested in the town? The capital is right there, arms wide open, and he’d have a better goddamn chance there than he will ever have here. We’re all trying to make the most of everything we have, but then there’s that delusional bloke.”\n\n“He’s not delusional, Micheal. It’s the will of the beyond!” the other man chuckled, “I mean you saw how he was. He’s a man of God, right? I mean come on, he wears a giant cross around his neck. What did you expect?”\n\n“I expect them to fall in the same fate as the symbol they chose to remember their lord by,” Adam scoffed.\n\n“Heh, I’d love to see him hear you right now.”\n\nLove this novel? Read it on Royal Road to ensure the author gets credit.\n\n“Oh fuck off, he’d take us all to confess our sins and pray for atonement,” the other man spoke in a mocking and condescending tone.\n\n“Enough of this useless chatter,” Adam interrupted, “Gentlemen, we’ve got work to do.”\n\n“Perhaps we could confiscate the book from that lad we spotted earlier.”\n\n“Right… who knows what content it hol—”\n\nJust then, they all came to a halt. Something felt off.\n\nThey were so caught up in their own words that they weren’t able to pay proper attention to their surroundings. But why would they do that? The exit was a one-way path from the hallway they were in. And yet, what was before them was neither the hallway, the exit, nor the street outside.\n\nIt was just darkness; a darkness that was as dim as the light of the night sky.\n\nAs their eyes adapted to their surroundings, they noticed several buildings in the distance, but they were all visible from the top in their line of sight.\n\n“Hey?! Where… W-Where are we?!” One of the men could hear the panic in his voice.\n\nBut even Adam was oblivious to the fact.\n\nAnd so they had no choice but to look downward.\n\nThere it was: the ground. It was what anyone would see if they were to look down at their feet, nothing out of the ordinary. However, their feet weren't nestled on that ground. That ground they were looking at was way down beneath them, exactly seventy-eight feet underneath them. Their feet were just right before that enormous view, right on the edge of dropping down to that ground.\n\nLooking at it from that far a distance, they felt their vision distort and their footing lose its balance.\n\n“What the fuck?! What the fuck?!” One of the men screamed, “What the fuck, Adam?!”\n\nWhen they came to the realization, they couldn’t comprehend the fact that somehow, in some way, they had gone up the staircase of the hospital building, all the way to the top till they reached the rooftop. And now they were standing right on the tip of the ledge.\n\nOne misstep and one of them would find his corpse stuck to the ground.\n\n“How the hell did we get here?!” Adam widened his eyes in shock.\n\n“Why are we here? Why are we like this?! What the fuck is going on?!”\n\n“Calm down!” Adam tried to collect his thoughts, “Let’s just… step back and—”\n\n“H-Hey,” one of them, who was silent this entire time, called out to them with fear in his voice, “I… I-I can’t move.”\n\nThey turned their heads in his direction. No matter how hard he tried to shake his legs, his feet were stuck to the ground.\n\n“I-I can’t move my feet. I can’t move, I…,” the man felt a great pressure against his chest, shortening his breath, “I… I CAN’T MOVE!! I CAN’T MOVE!!! ADAM, WHAT’S GOING ON?”\n\nThe man was shivering with fear all over his body, and yet, his feet never moved an inch. It was like his feet weren’t part of his body, as if it weren’t his own anymore. He shook his torso backward, but it was futile. He couldn’t get off the ledge, and neither could the others.\n\n“What in the goddamn…,” Adam said.\n\n“Guys, I…,” the man felt his consciousness slip away, “I don’t feel too good.”\n\nAt that moment, Adam and his other partner watched their colleague pass out from the fear before his body lost all its weight and balance, and then he slipped past the ledge.\n\nIn that following second, the man was sprawled down on the street underneath, his body mangled entirely in a way unimaginable.\n\n“Oh FUCK!” The other man screamed in terror.\n\nSuddenly, Adam, who was standing in the middle between all of them before, followed behind his colleague, leaving his other partner all alone with his own fear.\n\nThe man that was left could not believe what was happening to his colleagues. Both of them simply jumped off the ledge down to their death, just like that. It felt as if there was this strange entity controlling their bodies, compelling them to end their lives forthwith.\n\nNo warning. No explanation. It all just… happened.\n\nKnowing that his turn was next, the man could do nothing but scream, “GODDAMMIT!! IT CAN’T END LIKE THIS!!!”\n\nAs if his prayers had been answered, the man suddenly regained control over his body, he could feel his legs again. Before he could lose his balance, he pushed himself backward, causing him to fall back inside the rooftop ground. It was a miracle from above, a miracle that he didn’t have the time to rejoice for. Seeing his colleagues die like that edged him further to escape before he could finally feel safe.\n\nStill in a state of panic, he picked up his feet and ran as fast as he could to the door leading back to the staircase. He was running with tears in his eyes and slight relief in his thoughts that he didn’t jump off that ledge. Never did a watchman ever get humiliated in this manner, but this man didn’t care anymore about that.\n\nHe desired to live.\n\nFinally reaching the door, he grabbed onto the doorknob—\n\n“GAHHHHHHH!!!”\n\nIt was as hot as smelt iron straight out of a furnace.\n\nThe man kept screaming as he jerked backward. He looked at his hand, which was deeply scarred with a burn mark that was still fresh with smoke. But then… the scar lit up with fire.\n\n“W-What?!”\n\nThe man’s hand had caught fire out of nowhere — just from a little bit of heat from the scar. Immediately after, the fire slithered onto his arm, flourishing its growth across his whole body. He quickly slapped his arm multiple times, attempting to put out the fire with the cloth of his jacket, as he toiled back and forth from the hysteria. Sweat formed on his forehead, he didn’t know if that was from the heat or his loss of sanity, but he didn’t care.\n\n“AH AH AH AH HOT HAT AH AH AH AH”\n\nSoon, his body was up in flames. Despite that, he was still clinging onto his life as best he could, repeating the same action, over and over, when there was nothing he could put out the fire with anymore. He fell and rolled across the ground.\n\n“AH AH AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA”\n\nHis skin was gradually melting. The thin front that identified him as a human was crumbling down. The last shred of humanity within him was gone.\n\n“HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA”\n\nA minute passed… and then another… and another…\n\n“...”\n\nThe screams were gone.\n\nThe fire disappeared.\n\nAnd the world still moved.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nThat night, the hospital staff discovered that two watchmen had committed suicide by jumping off the rooftop, while the third was nothing but a burnt corpse, suffering a death of his own, separate from theirs.\n\nNo one knew why they did it or how the other was lit on fire.\n\nOut of everything that happened in town, this was, by far, the most bizarre incident in the town — that was what the people all commonly agreed on.\n\nIt was truly the result of the terrible string of fate.",

Each one would come and go, as they emptied their pockets for more food. This was the best the cafeteria had ever been.\n\nNo one would dare touch the cafeteria’s food, yet here were the students, having their fill of all they desired. From irradiated meatloaves made of God knows what, to quality Swedish meatballs that would have one salivating for more. Somehow, the food in the school’s cafeteria had managed to drastically change overnight.\n\nAs might be expected, this change in food quality was not far from Lauren’s friend’s reach who was a self-proclaimed connoisseur of all things food. She ate to her heart’s content, leaving her only with a turkey sandwich for last.\n\nBut Lauren was barely touching her food, resorting only to scrapping it with a fork. Her face bore a mundane expression. It was as clear as day that something was bothering her.\n\n“Come ohn,” her friend, Chloe, struggled to take a bite out of her sandwich (careful that she might burn the roof of her mouth from how hot it was) as she spoke up, “You cahn tshell me…”\n\nTo see Lauren without a smile was a red flag, especially for Chloe, who had been her friend for two years now, and was the first friend she ever made when she transferred to the school.\n\nAfter finally finishing her first bite, she scowled, “Earth to Lauren? Listen, I get it when you just… you know, go through a phase but if something’s wrong you can always tell me if you need help. Besides you just won that writing competition two weeks ago, you should be ecstatic…”\n\n「Two weeks…?」\n\nIt has been two weeks since the competition ended with her victory, two weeks since the boy that admired her in every way came to abhor her after he lost his legs to a horrible accident, two weeks since Zachary Ashworth disappeared.\n\nOne day, he was a cripple in the hospital, and then the next, he was an empty bed in the hospital room as if he had completely vanished. The hospital staff claimed to have never seen him walk out, which would be impossible considering his state at the time. Even then, none of the wheelchairs were taken. So quite frankly, there was no possible way the boy could have simply left the hospital, be it on foot or on a wheelchair, without being caught by an eye or two.\n\nIt puzzled Lauren greatly, who was not one for overthinking… but it wasn’t as great as it worried her.\n\n“I…,” she tried to put her stress into words, keeping it all in would do no good, and she knew that very well, “I’m worried about Zach. He’s been missing since the accident, and he hasn’t been picking up my calls at all.”\n\n“Zach?!” Chloe’s brows snapped together and then she glanced up to the ceiling, recalling the name in her head, before it came to her, “Oh the Nightingale’s boy, right?”\n\n“Nightin-who?” Her eyes flickered with uncertainty, “N-No, it’s Ashworth.”\n\n“Nuh-uh, that’s only one his Father’s side,” she snapped her fingers, “His mother’s family though? Oh man, they can turn the town on its head if they very well pleased.”\n\n“Huh… he never told me that…”\n\nIt didn’t come as much of a surprise to Lauren that Chloe had that specific piece of knowledge within her grasp. She was a renowned member of the newspaper club and practically knew all there was to know about the students in school, down to the little and unnecessary details. An impressive feat but one that was terrifying to an extent.\n\n“Ease up a little,” Chloe extended her arm and held onto Lauren’s arm in an attempt to soothe her, “You’re just overthinking things. That’s not like you at all.”\n\nThe tale has been illicitly lifted; should you spot it on Amazon, report the violation.\n\nShe was right.\n\nThe overthinking process, the worrisome attitude, were all traits that were unlike her. Normally, it would be her lightening up the mood to a conversation with her energetic behavior, be it with Chloe, Zach, or anyone else for that matter. She never failed to drop a smile. She shouldn’t feel this devastated for the disappearance of someone she had known for a little over two or three weeks.\n\nAnd yet, how could she not? This was Zach.\n\n“It’s just…,” her mouth twitched, “It was that night… the night he disappeared, those…”\n\nShe immediately held back her tongue before she could utter another word.\n\n「No…!」\n\nThere was a certain correlation in her mind that she desperately did not want to think of. She wanted to stop herself from thinking of that.\n\nHowever, being someone with a very keen observation of things, Chloe caught onto Lauren’s thoughts.\n\n“Oh, you mean those watch-dimwits who jumped off the hospital’s roof the other day?” She went back to eating her sandwich as she asked the question nonchalantly.\n\nLauren’s eyes widened in great fear, she felt her heart almost stop.\n\n“Oh? You do? Wait—” Chloe thought for a second, “You don’t think your boyfriend offed himse—”\n\n“Shshshshsh—” Lauren quickly sprung off her feet and silenced Chloe by covering her mouth as she shook her head in panic, “Don’t say that! No, don’t even think that! No, that didn’t happen. He’s just… missing.”\n\nIt was all just wrong. Zachary would never resort to ending his life no matter the circumstance. She believed he was just like her. And even if the worst scenario was the case, then something would have turned up.\n\nAfter that sudden shift in movement, she realized what she had done and returned back to her seat calmly. She was still holding her grip over her chest.\n\n“Alright! Alright!” Chloe spoke up as soon as she got a breathing room.\n\n“A-And he’s not my boyfriend…!” Her eyes darted.\n\n“You sure?” She chuckled, “You rarely spoke to me after you met him. You didn’t join me for lunch like this because you had a “meeting” with him. And now you come back to me after he disappeared like a sad little puppy ashamed from running away from its owner. By all means, you were probably lovey-dovey lovebirds when no one was looking and you don’t want me to call him your boyfriend?” She gave her a smug smile.\n\n“Okay, okay, I get it!” Lauren was embarrassed.\n\nThe two girls returned back to eating after they were done with this abrupt mess of a conversation.\n\n“Oh, right!” Chloe said, “Remember my Scholarship?”\n\nAs she continued her chatter to her, Lauren suddenly zoned out. She spotted someone in the corner of her eye.\n\nIt was Yeong-Gi.\n\nHer eyes widened in surprise.\n\nChloe turned to look behind her and with food in her mouth, she spoke, \"Oh shi, Bong-yee!\"\n\n\"Hey, quiet down!\" Lauren whispered.\n\nFor a second, it seemed like the boy, Yeong-Gi, glanced at her from the corner of her eyes before looking away. It almost startled her.\n\nHe was standing with a friend of his, a girl, who seemed to be his stark contrast in appearance. Strangely, the girl wasn’t dressed in the school’s uniform as everyone else was. To add to that, there was a bandage wrapped around her head.\n\nLauren wondered what had happened to him. “Oh, that’s… uh what’s her name?”\n\n“Hmm?” Chloe squinted her eyes, “Huh… I don’t know her. Well, that’s a first,” she commented as she threw the last piece of her sandwich in her mouth.\n\n“She's a friend of Yeong-gi's, I think I've seen her before,” she clarified, “I always forget her name.”\n\nDespite her rather dismal appearance, she seemed to have a still smile on her face, even with the injury on her head.\n\n\"Ah yes! She's that \"errand girl\" everyone's been talking about this year. She’s known around school for helping people, and I heard she fixes things. She does it all for free, after all.\"\n\nThe school was known for having many talented students. But this girl seemed to reign above most from a variety of different aspects. She was quite literally the perfect “errand girl.”\n\n\"Oh, so she's the one who fixed my watch?\" Lauren was dumbfounded, “She’s… quite… quite multi-talented.”\n\n“And she’s only a first-year, believe it or not.” She tilted her head forward and then back again, letting out a wry smile as if she felt proud for singing the girl’s praises in a discreet manner.\n\n“A first-year?! It's only been a few weeks and she's that popular?\" She was genuinely impressed, \"But what happened to her?\"\n\n“Oh yeah! They did say someone else in our school got into that accident as well. Could it be her? Oh, ask her if she knows anything about your boyfriend, she might know since they were both together. This is your chance!”\n\nLauren was not so sure, “I don’t think she—”\n\n“Just go,” Chloe waved her hand in her direction, “Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?”\n\n“I don’t even remember her name!” She exclaimed. Every time she was on the cusp of remembering her name, it would slip right away out of her mind like it was never there, to begin with. It was truly baffling.\n\n\"Well, neither do I,\" Chloe said.\n\n\"Yeong-Gi's there!\"\n\n\"Then that's a bonus, now hurry up!\"\n\nStill watching her from afar like bizarre secret admirers, the two girls noticed Yeongi-Gi had finished up his conversation with the girl and left. As for the girl, she was starting to collect her stuff to prepare to head out of the cafeteria.\n\n\"Well, now Yeongi-Gi's gone, happy?\" Chloe eyed Lauren with a mad look.\n\nLauren scoffed, \"Would you please stop?\"\n\n“You better hurry up before you fully miss your chance, missy.” She snatched a look at the plate on the other side of the table.\n\n“You just want my lunch, don’t you?” Lauren drooped her eyelids in disappointment as she realized why Chloe really wanted her to leave.\n\n“Come on, I’m not a monster… —okay, only the pudding!”\n\nShe rolled her eyes and sighed, “Fine, whatever…”",

She didn’t tower over her like Zachary but the height difference was still clear.\n\n“Um, excuse me,” Lauren tapped on her shoulder.\n\nThe girl turned around, “Ah, hey Lauren!”\n\n“Oh?” She was taken aback by the mention of her name, “You… You know me…!”\n\n“Of course I do, why wouldn’t I?”\n\nHearing that was like a punch in the gut. Of all names to accidentally forget, it had to be the girl who still remembered hers. Just facing the smile drawn on her face was embarrassing enough to have her dart her eyes from guilt. Not to mention that she was possibly the one that managed to save Zachary — perhaps they were both injured, but they came out alive on the other end.\n\n「If only I weren’t so forgetful.」\n\n“Can I help you with anything?” The girl noticed the stress on her face.\n\n“As a matter of fact, yes,” she quickly shifted her expression to that of a cheerful one, “Uh… How should I put this?”\n\n“Ah,” the girl chuckled, “You want to know if I was one of the people in the accident?” He asked casually.\n\n“H-How…?!” She was startled by her almost spot-on guess.\n\nIf she were indeed caught up in the same accident as Zachary’s, then she would have been the one who saved his life then.\n\n“I’ve been getting that a lot today thanks to this,” she awkwardly smiled as he rubbed the back of her head, hinting at the bandage wrapped around it, “And I don’t really blend in with these clothes.”\n\n“Oh, must have been a hassle, huh,” she tried to smooth her part of the conversation.\n\n“Not really, I don’t mind the spotlight once in a while,” she laughed, “Anyway, yeah, I’m the moron who risked her life to save another moron. Everyone's surprised a girl like me would go so far to save someone.”\n\nEven if the term “moron,” referring to Zachary, was said in a humorous manner, Lauren was not too happy to hear it. She did not know why — it was just a subtle ache in her chest.\n\nShe took a deep breath.\n\n“You wouldn’t happen to know where Zach is?”\n\n“Uh…,” she grit his teeth as she averted her gaze, “No, sorry…”\n\n“Oh…,” she eyed the floor.\n\n“I never got the chance to see him after the accident. I don’t think he even knows who I am, heh.” She tried to brighten the mood after giving her the doleful answer, “I know you two were friends…”\n\n「Were we…?」\n\nHer last moments with Zachary were not so bright. In fact, she wondered if he enjoyed her company at all. It always seemed like she was forcing him to follow along with her plans and do her bidding, she never thought that those doubts might be real. To her, she just wanted to show someone with the same passion what she was like.\n\nBut she never truly considered how he felt about it all.\n\nWhenever he would be hit by a slump, be it his lack of motivation or his episode at the concert, she would try to cheer him up with half-baked words. And then the day of that dreadful accident, she was so gratified by her victory at first glance that she never thought of his loss. Even after he had run away, she didn’t push her legs to run after him until it was too late.\n\nReading on Amazon or a pirate site? This novel is from Royal Road. Support the author by reading it there.\n\n「Is that what friends do?」\n\nFriends should be there for one another when the time is right, not when all is said and done. And she had done neither of those properly. What—\n\n“Are you alright?!”\n\n“Huh?!” Lauren was snatched away from her thoughts. It was quite a bizarre moment for her. She had never dwelled that deep in her thoughts before.\n\nWhen she turned her head back up, she noticed the girl looking at her with a worrisome gaze.\n\n“You seem a little out of it, huh,” the girl expressed his concern.\n\nShe looked at her with a curious expression. She failed to understand her.\n\n「Friends…」\n\nThat girl wasn’t Zachary’s friend, and yet she…\n\n「Why?」\n\n“Hey…” Lauren urged. “Why did you jump? Why did you save him?”\n\nIt would seem like a completely unwarranted question, but it needed to be uttered. An act of goodwill or not, in her eyes, it was irrational to help someone at the cost of one’s self. Even if in some way a truly selfless person existed, the worst-case scenario would be them losing their lives and the one they attempted to save, ultimately resulting in a wasted goal.\n\n“Because…” The girl held his tongue. An apologetic smile crept across her face. “I just want to help people, isn’t that enough of a reason? I don’t regret it, never will.”\n\n“...!” She couldn’t accept it, “But you…”\n\nOut of nowhere, Chloe emerged to Lauren’s side and took her by the shoulder. She had noticed her friend’s odd behavior from afar and decided to interfere before anything spiraled. She easily towered over the girl — it never occurred to Lauren how tall she was before.\n\n“Hiii there, nice to meet you,” she faced the girl and put out her left hand for a handshake as she held Lauren with the other, “Chloe! Esteemed member of the newspaper committee and Lauren’s dearly beloved. How are you doing today?”\n\n“Uh… hi?” The girl, unsettled by Chloe’s sudden appearance, shook her hand.\n\nLauren was confused by her appearance, “What are you—”\n\n*SLAP*\n\nLauren’s face reddened in that instant.\n\n“(D-Did you just slap my a—)”\n\n“Shhhh,” Chloe pulled her closer and lowered her voice, “(Relax, I'm here to save you from yourself.)”\n\n“(I’m not—)” She shook her head, “(W-Was that really necessary?)”\n\n“(To me, yeah.)”\n\nThe situation could not get any more embarrassing for Lauren. When they turned their gaze back to the girl, the girl was looking at them with the most oblivious expression, as if nothing had happened. Luckily, that worked in Lauren’s favor.\n\n“Anyway, as I was saying,” Chloe smiled at the girl, “As a member of the newspaper club, I have to ask on everyone’s behalf: How did you recover so quickly from the accident?”\n\n“Huh?!” The girl was puzzled.\n\n“Oh, and may I just say, your hair looks absolutely wonderful today — I’m surprised I haven’t noticed you before.”\n\n“Ah… this…,” the girl averted her gaze in embarrassment and then put on a smile, “I lost a bet.”\n\n“Well, whomever you lost to, they surely have a fine taste.”\n\nChloe pushed Lauren away without averting her gaze or smile from the girl's sight. She hid one of her hands behind her back and waved at Lauren to continue walking and leave the place.\n\n「What was that about? Is that how weird Zach thought I was?」\n\nAs Lauren walked away, she would briefly touch her lower back.\n\n“Ugh… That really hurt…”\n\n「She really knows where to hit.」\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nLauren leisurely made her way through the school’s hallways.\n\nIt was eerily empty. Most of the students were still drowning themselves in the cafeteria’s new selection, and there weren’t many classes with how the town’s curfew tightened its period with each passing week. Coincidentally, the number of teachers and students present every day lessened once again. So it was natural for the halls to be empty.\n\nWhen she snapped out of her thoughts once again, Lauren realized she was standing in front of the glass trophy showcase. This is where she and Zachary had last talked ordinarily with each other…\n\n「...Before the accident…」\n\nShe took a deep breath and calmly let it out.\n\nAs much as she was worried about Zachary’s disappearance, she didn’t want it to hinder her normality. She believed in blind hope, in the optimism she held up on a pedestal, no matter how severe it was going to be.\n\nNothing good ever came from pessimism.\n\nYet still…\n\nShe looked at the trophies behind the glass and wondered what went inside Zachary’s mind when he stared at the trophies for minutes on end.\n\nWas he thinking of the success he strived for? Did he desire to once see his name among these trophies? Did he—\n\n「...oh no…!」\n\nDespite thinking otherwise, Lauren couldn’t forget about him, about Zachary. The boy simply wouldn’t leave her mind to herself. Just thinking of him was enough to almost make her think like him — he was ravaging her thoughts like a plague. Everything she had done today was unusual for her. The pessimism, the awkwardness, the lack of conversation. None of these things belonged to Lauren. They were the very same things she was trying to cure.\n\n“Gh…”\n\n「Where are you?」",

There was a certain cold gaze to his eyes that petrified anyone it met. He was the complete opposite of Mrs. Grace who was known around school for her resilience — an excuse students use for them to go about their gossip in class uninterrupted. Unfortunately for this class, however, all they had was the pessimistic Mr. Anderson for the two years they shared together.\n\n「Dull…」\n\nNothing but the wind and the chirps of the morning birds outside respired into the lifeless room packed with students.\n\nYet another mundane day in school.\n\n“...!”\n\nThe drowsy girl, Lauren, widened her eyes as she raised her head off the desk. It wasn’t from the fact that she almost dozed off during Mr. Anderson’s class or the fact that she was particularly afraid of him.\n\n「So… dull…」\n\nEveryone knew her for excellence and outstanding performance, both in class and outside, so for her to lose that ever-burning passion, for even a second, was absurd.\n\nLauren Cherith was perfect, the perfect honor student — no one less.\n\n「I have to be…」\n\n“Miss Cherith!” The voice of Mr. Anderson echoed in her ears.\n\n“Huh?!” Her eyes turned their attention to him.\n\n“Meet me at the faculty office once you’re done with your classes for the day.”\n\nBefore she had realized it, the students were getting off their desks and heading to the door. Even Mr. Anderson was collecting his notes from off his own desk and placed them into his suitcase.\n\n“Wha…”\n\nJust now they were starting class and yet now… now, the class was over?\n\n「When did it…?」\n\nIt felt like a whole hour of Lauren’s life had gone by in, quite literally, a second. A portion that she could not get back. She wondered if she really dozed off and missed the whole class just like that.\n\n“Miss Cherith?” Mr. Anderson, with usual loud and direct voice, called out to her once again, “Am I clear?”\n\n“Oh yes, of course, I’ll be right away, sir.”\n\n「Focus…」\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“Is something wrong, Lauren?”\n\n“Huh?!” Lauren’s eyes flashed.\n\n「What was I…?」\n\nShe found herself facing her friend, Chloe, who was eying her a disturbing look. They were both sitting together in the school’s cafeteria, once again.\n\nAnother day; another moment.\n\nTo her, it felt like she had instantly jumped from one scene to another. She couldn’t make sense of how she was losing track of her time, and yet, she still remembered what happened to her in those missing portions, like a clip rushing into her mind all of a sudden.\n\n“You seem a little lost lately.” Chloe snickered.\n\n“Oh…,” her face went downward.\n\n「Lost…」\n\nJust the other day she was getting an earful from Mr. Anderson, who was worried about her declining grades in his class (even if he did not particularly show it on his stern-looking face). He, too, mentioned how she seemed lost whenever she attended his class. She was always his best student, not to mention the best in school, so to see her descend like this did not bring a smile to his face. He acknowledged her effort in winning the competition and even wondered if her writing was hindering her academic progress. He warned her not to stray too from her path, especially when following her passion.\n\nIt was understandable for someone like her to be hit with a slump, he would say. But this felt like something on a whole other level.\n\nLately, she felt… lost, complete, and utterly lost. It felt as if she was watching a film reel of her life unfold before her while she sifted through whatever grabbed her attention. One moment she was with her teacher, and in another, she was with Chloe on a whole different day.\n\nEverything felt disconnected.\n\n「Is it because of him?」\n\n“You okay?” Chloe asked.\n\n「No… can’t be. It’s fine.」\n\n“Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?” She brushed off her thoughts and smiled.\n\nBack to reality.\n\n“Now, forget about me, what are you doing?”\n\nIt wasn’t strange for Chloe to be seen reading a book here. But to someone like Lauren, who knew her in more ways than one, this was odd. She was the type of person who’d prefer to read somewhere quiet and alone.\n\n“Oh, this?” Chloe turned back to the book’s cover, “This is just something that girl gave to me.”\n\n“That girl?!” Lauren eyed her with estranged looks.\n\n“What? The errand girl or whatever from the other day,” she chuckled, “We actually hit it off pretty well after you left.”\n\n“Really now?” She wasn’t convinced, “After…?”\n\n“Okay, I get it, maybe I got off with the wrong foot with her… but she’s actually a pretty nice girl.”\n\nThis story has been unlawfully obtained without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.\n\n“You?! With her?! Since when?”\n\n“It was only for the few minutes we spent in the cafeteria,” she sighed, “You just want to rag on me this time?”\n\n“Maybe…”\n\n“Anyway,” she rolled her eyes, “This book’s actually enjoyable. And take a look at this.”\n\nChloe flipped through the pages till the middle of the book. On that page was a thin piece of paper with a few words written on it.\n\n“This is…?” Lauren failed to see the point.\n\n“It’s a poem,” she placed her finger on the paper, “It looks like she forgot her poem here.”\n\n“Huh?!” She narrowed her eyes, “How do you know it’s hers?”\n\n“Well, one, it is her book. Second, the poem’s amateur work at best — it is pretty cute though.”\n\nLauren glanced at the poem.\n\nA faint sky of blistering nature.\n\nA perilous island of blightful danger.\n\nA lighthouse stood calmly over the cliff.\n\nWatch the sea, it was all that was required.\n\nWatch the mermaids, it was all that it desired.\n\nIn Her Dream; This Dream; a most delightful thought.\n\nIn His Dream; This Dream; a chase for what he once sought.\n\n「Wow, these words…」\n\nThey weren’t the best out there, not by a long shot. But somehow, this poem felt soothing, its words and meanings were entrancing to the mind. It was as if it spoke to her directly as if it was trying to calm her mind without much effort.\n\nAs it happened, she was content with it. With the way her mind and thoughts were lately, this was much needed to ease her.\n\nBeyond this nexus:\n\nDo fabled heroes ever rest and sleep?\n\nOr is all they ever do; fight and weep?\n\nDid you, who still seeks perfection, ever take that leap?\n\nOr did you_______________\n\n「Huh?!」\n\nFor a moment, it felt like the words had completely disappeared. It looked as if the ink had drowned into the paper, never to resurface again. Yet the words were still there, naturally, like everything should be.\n\nLauren blinked to make sure she was wide awake.\n\n“To think little errand girl is trying to be a poet.” Chloe drifted off to her wishful daydream.\n\nLauren looked back at the poem. Reading it again and again, she felt nothing, nothing like that feeling she first got upon reading it again.\n\n「Wha…」\n\n“I-In any case, we shouldn’t be reading this,” she snarled as she put back the paper and closed the book.\n\n“A little too late for that. She might as well catch us red-handed now!” She loudly exclaimed.\n\n“K-Keep it down…”\n\nLuckily, the crowd was loud enough to cover up for it. There were a few students here and there having their lunch and keeping to themselves. However, it seemed the student council and the moral discipline committee were scouring the place, removing the decorations that were hung around the school just recently.\n\n“Seems like Halloween did not sit well with the committee,” Chloe commented as she threw the last piece of her sandwich in her mouth, “It was pretty fun while it lasted though.”\n\nAfter a whole month dedicated to preparing for this ghostly event, the school decided to bring it to an abrupt end. It was as if that small period was a dream to them. And now, they had awoken from it and reverted back to the norm.\n\n“Can’t always expect things to change on a dime, I guess,” Chloe chuckled.\n\n“Right…”\n\n「Change…」\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nLauren opened her eyes.\n\nIt was the dawn of the morning, the light of the bright sun shimmer down on the room through the open windows. Once again, the birds were having their usual morning choir as they do, even when near her house. They sang so elegantly in unison; it was almost unbelievable this was the chirruping of mere birds.\n\nYet she felt monotony, instead of liveliness, seep into her ears.\n\nWhen was it that she stopped seeing the color in pieces? She wondered.\n\nAs per her routine for the past few weeks, she reached for her phone beside the pillows. It had almost run out of battery that day prior due to her constant bickering with her text messages, but luckily, there was still a glimmer of life within it at the moment.\n\nEven when her eyes were still half-open, she opened up her phone. Clinging onto a faint touch of hope, she went through her list of the latest calls.\n\nLauren didn’t tell anyone… but she still hasn’t forgotten about him.\n\n「No calls…」\n\nThere were no new calls overnight, which greatly disappointed her — and that did not account for the other fifty-eight failed calls she had spent almost all night trying to reach through.\n\nAlmost three weeks since his disappearance and there was still nothing from the boy who went by Zachary Ashworth, he simply vanished as if he never existed. People still remembered who he was but no one cared enough to ask about his whereabouts but Lauren — even Chloe would make sarcastic remarks about how ridiculous she was looking for him.\n\nWhen she was asked about the reason behind the sudden failure in her academic performance, she simply made them think it was the success of her competition getting to her head. She never told them that she was searching for the missing boy for hours on end after school. Only Chloe knew of her search, and even then, it wasn’t to the extent it was really in.\n\nBut still…\n\nShe never found a glimmer of hope during her search. Not one clue and not one hint. A new fear had rooted itself in her mind that Zachary would only be remembered in a lucid memory while the earth erased every sign he had ever existed.\n\nIt was no longer a matter of concern to a missing friend. Lauren needed to find Zachary.\n\nShe tapped on his contact once again for a call.\n\n【...】\n\n【......】\n\n【..........】\n\nNothing.\n\n「Where are you?」\n\nLauren dropped the phone on her chest and let out a deep sigh.\n\nAnother morning, another day with nothing.\n\n「I don’t wanna go to school…」\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“Hey, where have you been?” Chloe asked.\n\n“What?” Lauren was puzzled.\n\nOnce again, the cafeteria.\n\nOnce again, she was talking with her friend in the same place.\n\nOnce again, the same scene.\n\n“You skipped school yesterday,” Chloe sighed, “Something’s up? A fever? You’ve never missed school before.”\n\n“Just didn’t feel like it…,” she quietly said.\n\n“Ooookay?” She raised an eyebrow.\n\nSuch an excuse was uncharacteristic of Lauren, and Chloe knew that very well.\n\n“Is something wrong? Are your parents back?”\n\nDue to a bit of tension in the family, Lauren’s parents decided to take a vacation elsewhere but she held her education above all else, and so she was left to fend for herself since the school year started.\n\n“No…” Lauren said nonchalantly.\n\n“... Is it Z—” Chloe tried to get her to say something.\n\n“I’m gonna go home…”\n\n“Wait what?”\n\nWithout further interruptions, Lauren stood up and walked out of the cafeteria, leaving the school that day.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 17 - Adrift the Ocean\n\nlonging /ˈlɒŋɪŋ/\n\na yearning desire.\n\nIt was pure white.\n\nA world of pure white. A scene that could be described better as a void of nothing and everything all the same rather than a place. A void that became the home of Lauren Cherith.\n\nAll that ever was and all that she knew to be was that void. As her body sank into melancholic comfort, she’d sometimes pick out a mistake, a flaw, a “crack” in this pure empty world. Much like a dry colorless canvas no matter what brush one used to fill it, the void wasn’t uniform. It was rich in detail but that didn’t matter.\n\nNone of it mattered.\n\nLauren hadn’t left this void for days, possibly weeks or even months. It was slowly becoming her new reality.\n\nThe wind pulled a few leaves and hurried into the room through the vacant window to take shelter from the snowstorm outside. For a moment, she felt her reality become distorted — like it shouldn't coincide with the natures of the outside world. The white void was the ceiling and the melancholic comfort was courtesy of her bed.\n\n「How… How long?」\n\nShe thought to herself.\n\n「Maybe I should try calling again…」\n\nOn cue, her phone rang.\n\nShe quickly went for her phone. It was… Yeong-Gi.\n\n“...”\n\nShe sighed and put the phone aside, leaving it to ring for a few more minutes. This might have been one of the few times he ever called her, yet she ignored it. She should have been hot on her feet upon seeing his name, yet she didn’t. It didn’t matter.\n\nShortly after, it turned to voicemail.\n\n“Hey, Lauren!” Yeong-Gi’s cheerful voice came through, “Just uh… checking up on you. I know it’s prolly weird for me to call or leave a message so we don’t talk much but… you haven’t been to school for a while. Teachers are worried… I’m worried…”\n\n“...,” she opened up her mouth to speak but immediately pursued her lips. For a moment, his words almost caught her attention.\n\n“Wait… this prolly came out the wrong way uh…,” his voice seemed slightly shaken from embarrassment, “W-Well, we’re worried about you, Lauren. Please give us a call… anything. Thanks.”\n\n*beep*\n\nThat sound had become familiar; very familiar. The same could be said for Yeong-Gi’s voice. Ever cheerful and ever-optimistic with no hint of sadness or worry. Still lost in that quiet void, Lauren wished for that optimism. She desired to have the smile on her face to be back yet it wouldn’t return — she didn’t understand why it left in the first place.\n\nSuddenly, a gust of wind rushed into the room once again, this time slamming the door shut.\n\n*SLAM*\n\nLauren jumped; frightened, confused, and… in pain?\n\nA strange, raw sensation coursed through her cheek pulsating with every heartbeat. Every twitch, every drop of sweat, and every breath exacerbated the intense pain. Yet deep down she felt something.\n\nA connection?\n\nNo, it was more akin to a live operation without an anesthetic where her heart was laid bare and the first incision was made.\n\nOperations take time and this one would prove no different.\n\nThis was going to be a long, painful one.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n「Come on…」\n\n【Call Failed】\n\nLauren sat in the corner of her bedroom, alone and downcast, with her face buried deep between her legs.\n\nIt was just another day since Zachary disappeared; just another day since the impetus of her life completely changed.\n\nYet she herself did not know: what exactly changed?\n\nWhat brought her this immense feeling of melancholy?\n\nWhat took that boy away from her?\n\nShe glanced over to her nightstand in the barely lit room. There lied her magnum opus, the manuscript that won her first genuine prize, the thing that proved her worth as an author of true art, the thing that was going to elevate her to a world yet unknown.\n\nIf you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.\n\nWas it a bright-colored world? Doubts would fill her mind.\n\nHad it been the ‘Lauren’ from a month prior, she would have been high off the ground, endlessly celebrating her key to the new world. Now, she had the same outcome, however, it wasn’t the same feeling she had expected.\n\nPerhaps she needed someone to celebrate with, to share that passion with. If it was someone, then her father, Chloe, her friends at school, and practically anyone would do just fine. But no, it had to be him, it had to be that boy. No one else understood her as well as him. Initially she thought she was merely helping someone who was somewhat similar to her, even as far as considering it that she was saving him through this act of goodwill.\n\nThe matter of the fact was… he was saving her.\n\nYes, the girl who always smiled and offered optimism wherever she went needed saving. She needed someone— no, that boy, to pull her out of this pit of melancholy.\n\nA person who genuinely existed with her happy facade in this apathetic town simply did not truly exist. It would be something out of a fairy tale; out of a depressed and affection-starved piece of “fiction” that perfectly reflected its author and their readers.\n\n「Starved for affection…」\n\n*DING*\n\nAll of a sudden, her phone lit up, and so did the smile on her face.\n\n「Please…」\n\nShe sprung off her feet and grabbed it.\n\n【Chloe: “Hey!”】\n\nNot Zachary.\n\nThe smile on her face quickly faded.\n\n【Chloe: “Why aren’t u answering ur calls?”】\n\n【Chloe: “and ur door too”】\n\n【Chloe: “Do u know how many times I waited outside for you?”】\n\n【Chloe: “Yooo”】\n\n【Chloe: “Lauren come on”】\n\n【Chloe: “Its been 4 days, where are u?”】\n\n【Chloe: “Teachers won’t stop hounding me cus of u.”】\n\n【Chloe: “If ur feeling down”】\n\n【Chloe: “wanna meet up together with Yeongi?”】\n\n【Chloe: “Or maybe alone...”】\n\n【Chloe: “Ik u been dying to spend time with him.”】\n\n【Chloe: “No?”】\n\n【Chloe: “What about a girls’ night out? Up for the task? Whaddya say?”】\n\n【Chloe: “I’ll make it a special one ♡”】\n\n【Chloe: “Heeeeeeeeeey”】\n\n【Chloe: “I know ur in there”】\n\n【Chloe: “Lauren”】\n\n【Chloe: “Answer me”】\n\n【Chloe: “please”】\n\n「Annoying…」\n\nLauren frowned with disgust in her eyes. She ignored the text messages from her concerned friend and threw the phone on her bed.\n\nNever a time came where she would imagine losing her connection with her oldest friend. But it was very clear why and when it would come.\n\nIt was the same connection she projected onto someone else once.\n\nChloe was a beacon of light, one that she could not stand to look at for too long. She tried to be that beacon as well, but for someone else, and ultimately, the result was all the same. They shied away from her “light” and disappeared just like she was doing now with her friend. All those feelings of jubilation she once felt toward her withered into dust.\n\nShe would often wonder in the dark corners of her mind if he could have felt the same. Not a thought went by without her thinking back to him. There was no way to escape. This was no time to dwell upon the meaningless things in her life.\n\nZachary had to be found.\n\nAnd yet… What can she possibly do? She had been cooped up in her room for days like an angsty teen who had given up on all life and crawled to a dark corner of their own, where they could hide from unnecessary noise in the shelters of the abyss.\n\n“It’s all…,” she desperately spoke from her dry mouth that hasn’t uttered a word for days.\n\nOnce again, she looked at her manuscript; the epitome of her success.\n\nWhat was it? She would think while looking at the manuscript.\n\nThe pit she had fallen deep down into had caused her to even forget why or what she wrote in that manuscript. It could bring to doubt if it was ever really worth praise.\n\nAfter all, there was one thing she wouldn’t forget.\n\nThese sad and lump pieces of paper were bundled together in a matter of two days. For any writer of any kind, it wouldn’t be much of a surprise, especially if one had won a couple of awards before then — “childish” awards, but still awards in the end.\n\nHowever, Lauren, who hadn’t written a thing in the past two years since her last competition, who was faced with a deep slump beyond any help, managed to finally write this manuscript so quickly and so elegantly it had won her the ultimate prize all of a sudden. It was crazy to think about it. Something like this would not be this far-fetched in a fairy tale of overcoming failure.\n\nBut as the memories would rush back to her mind, the answer became clear.\n\nYet again, it all tied back to that boy. She would have never written a thing if it weren’t for meeting that boy if weren’t for looking into his eyes, if it weren’t for touching his hand, if—\n\n“GAAH!!!”\n\nLauren screamed at the top of her lungs as she vigorously swung her arm around the desk, throwing the manuscript aside and making a mess with all the papers scattered around the room, floating down to the ground.\n\nAs she realized what she had done, she shivered in her place, losing control over her legs and falling to her knees. Following that second, she quickly crawled to the side of her bed and leaned her back against it.\n\n“How—ah…,” she struggled to enunciate her words as she whimpered, “How can you do this to me?”\n\nThe whimper became louder, in which case, she buried her face back in between her thighs. The neighbors were sure to have heard her scream and she didn’t want to attract any more attention, especially with her parents gone.\n\nBut still, she could not hold back the pain.\n\nSoon the whimpering turned to sob. And then as tears flooded her eyes down to her cheeks and her body trembled with fear and pain, the sobbing turned to cry.\n\n“Why…,” she would snivel, “Zach…”\n\nYet another day for the girl who shunned everyone out for a dream.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 18 - The Unexpected Visitor\n\nvisitor /ˈvɪzɪtə/\n\na person visiting someone or somewhere, especially socially or as a tourist.\n\nThe ceiling was dark; very dark; it would appear almost colorless.\n\nAs a “change of pace,” Lauren found herself lying on the sofa in the living room, endlessly staring up into the ceiling. It was as if she was a madwoman stuck in a padded cell. She knew she was losing her mind and yet she couldn’t stop it, she didn’t know how or why. All she knew… was that she knew. She was content with it.\n\nYet another day came. Yet another time lost.\n\n“...”\n\nShe lacked words to say anything even in this melancholic state. But there was no need to speak, she was all alone after all.\n\n*RIIIIIIING*\n\nAll of a sudden, the doorbell to the house screamed in her ear, making her jump abruptly from the shock.\n\nShe had not heard the bell ring for a long while, but that didn’t particularly mean no visitors attempted to stop by recently. It was rather a matter of… the doorbell not working at all. It was broken. Any visitor would have to knock on the door to gain the attention of the residents — it was for that reason she was able to ignore the knocks so easily these past few days. So for it to ring suddenly like that as if it was working just fine this entire time, was certainly odd.\n\nBut that didn’t matter to Lauren now. What clouded her thoughts was the fact that someone was here to see her. She would hopefully think that he had finally come for her, but she knew better than to be this mindlessly optimistic.\n\n「Chloe…」\n\nThere was no one else but her who knew exactly where she lived. She was so persistent in getting her attention that she might have even gotten someone to fix the doorbell so that she could endlessly annoy her with it to open the door. Her mind might have been ridiculously overthinking this but she didn’t mind.\n\n“There…,” she coughed, “There’s no one here!”\n\nShe wanted to push away Chloe. She didn’t want to confront her face to face.\n\n「Just leave already.」\n\n*RIIING*\n\n“For God’s sake, go away and bother someone else!” Her shout was even louder than before.\n\n*RIIING*\n\nThis content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\n\nBut the visitor was persistent.\n\n「You…」\n\nLauren grit her teeth and rushed to the door before she pulled the knob. “Chloe! Leave me alone, I don’t—”\n\nOnce the door was open, Lauren halted her words and looked at the visitor in bewilderment. It was not Chloe standing in front of her, nor was it anyone she had met before.\n\nThere was simply a young woman standing on the porch to her house, who was taller than Lauren by quite a few inches and possibly even Zachary. With short blonde hair and eyes coated in violet, she looked at Lauren with a fierce gaze. And yet she didn’t utter a word to state the purpose of her unexpected visit.\n\n“Sorry, um…,” Lauren blinked twice as she tried to collect her thoughts, “Who…?”\n\n“You know Zach Ashworth?” The young woman bluntly asked.\n\n“...!” Her eyes widened upon hearing his name.\n\n「She knows something?!」\n\n“Z-Zach?!” She tried not to falter in her words as she stepped forward, “You know Zach?! Y-You know where he is??!! Please tell me!!”\n\n“...shit…,” the young woman scoffed and averted her gaze for a second, “I was going to ask you the same thing.”\n\n“Oh…,” Lauren quickly stepped back, almost losing her footing. She felt dazed enough that she could drop dead on the ground right then and there. But she still held onto her consciousness.\n\n“I’m Zach’s cousin!” The young woman sighed, “He’s been missing and we’ve been looking for him for a while now. I thought you might know something.”\n\nLauren felt hope slip away from her grasp. If even his family couldn’t find him, then who will. He couldn’t have just vanished off the face of the Earth all of a sudden. It was nonsense.\n\n“Sorry to bother you like this,” the young woman had noticed the sorry state Lauren was in. She was in no shape to meet anyone outside, otherwise, she’d quickly be mistaken for someone who had escaped a mental asylum, “I’ll go now.” The young woman excused herself and turned to leave.\n\nBut Lauren wasn’t about to let her go.\n\n“W-Wait!” She quickly grabbed onto the young woman’s arm before—\n\n「Huh!」\n\n█████ █████\n\nHoc triste Terra a M̷̞͖̠͌̑̉͋i̵͙͔̳̓̒̐r̷̞̈̀̀͒a̸̲̺̍̐̆b̴̡̠͗̒̆͝î̸̫l̶̨̧̜̘͊i̷̖͕̙̗͗́́\n\nFeeling a sharp sting in her mind, Lauren immediately let go in shock. It gave her quite the headache right after. She placed her hand on top of her head to try and contain this brief moment of sudden pain. Her mind had spiraled into a worse mess than it already was with her jumbled thoughts before.\n\nThe young woman, herself, was surprised by Lauren’s abrupt behavior.\n\n“You… okay?” She tilted her head in confusion.\n\nLauren shook her head from the mess inside and looked at the young woman with determined eyes, “Please! If you find him or discover anything about where he is, please tell me!” She held the young woman’s hands together with hers, begging her to agree to her absurd request.\n\n“Uh…,” the young woman’s eyes flickered with concern, “Suuure…?”\n\n“Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!” Lauren, with tears of joy filling her eyes, forcefully shook the young woman’s hand.\n\n“No… problem…,” the young woman raised an eyebrow for a second before excusing herself and leaving the premises.\n\nLauren returned back inside the house and shut the door behind her.\n\nShe glanced at her hand, remembering the time she felt a spark ignite within it and the headache that still persisted in her mind. But she was quick to brush it off as it didn’t matter. It was simply a spark, friction. That wasn’t something odd, it would happen sometimes — the human body generated electricity after all.\n\nLetting out a deep sigh, she leaned her back against the door. There was still hope. It eased her mind knowing that she was not the only one looking for him this whole time. However, it also troubled her with ridiculous thoughts.\n\nIf anyone was to find Zachary, it had to be her.",

She was growing weary of this meaningless chase that rendered her trapped within her mind.\n\nHowever, she kept going. It was far too late to put a stop to it, even if nothing yielded results. There was only this one path in front of her.\n\nOften she would think of rushing out of the house barefoot to search for Zachary and never return until she had found him.\n\nWould it take hours? Would it take days? Would it take weeks? It didn’t matter to her. But the mysterious blizzard and her legs that lost their weight long ago would still stop her from standing up and pulling open the door to the outside.\n\n“〔What do you mean no? I told you already, dammit, I don’t know where I left it.〕”\n\nSnatched away from her reality to another, she heard a voice echoing from the halls outside. It was a nasty voice that clearly belonged to a woman.\n\n「Oh…」\n\n“〔God, you were out drinking again? I can’t believe you.〕”\n\nThe other was that of a man’s voice.\n\nIt was a loud ruckus outside that seeped in with their gruff voices through the thin walls of the house. They seemed to be arguing with one another. The woman seemed to falter with her words, she was loud and erratic, while the man who tried to keep a firm appearance, lacked the power to raise terror with his voice — or rather he was tired.\n\n“〔Pshh, stop making such a big deal outta it.〕”\n\n“〔I’m… I’m not— I’m not making a big deal out of it. Why would I ever? It’s just our goddamn wedding ring. To hell with it! You somehow lost it while you were drinking your brains out in some good-for-nothing trash heap where you can’t tell the difference between a drink and a bottle of sewer water. But… no! I shouldn’t care.〕”\n\nThe man struggled to keep a firm tone, causing him to retort to dropping sarcastic comments here and there.\n\n“〔No fun at all. You know what? If you just love to complain about a drink then here!〕”\n\n*crash*\n\nThe sound of glass bottles shattering against the ground and the walls echoed in the house, they elevated the noise to a degree unimaginable. Perhaps even the neighboring houses were taking notice of what was going on. But, in all honesty, it was nothing of note to anyone who lived in that neighborhood. This was just another day for the Cherith family.\n\nHer parents were back.\n\nNot a day after their return from their trip and the arguments started again.\n\nDespite the trip being an attempt to mend their relationship, nothing seemed to change.\n\nEverything was still the same.\n\nHer mother was still the terrible and neglecting alcoholic she was, putting herself before everyone and above all else. She would bicker about everything and anything that did not seem “right” in her eyes. Her father was still the family man who willfully listened to his daughter whenever she needed it and knew when to set boundaries. But he still lacked the power to hold back the chaos of his wife.\n\nLauren would wonder what forced her father to stay with someone like her mother for seventeen years. For all she knew, her mother was always like that, without love for others or herself. She never did a thing for the family, it was all Lauren and her father. So it was odd how she would still stick around despite all she had done (or hadn’t, in this case).\n\nWhat kept her father from divorcing her mother? What kept her mother from not walking out the front door and leaving the family? The two were of contradicting nature.\n\nAnd then there was the most tiresome issue of all: her mother’s alcoholism.\n\nIn the past, her mother was all for bickering and was seemingly the same as now, but back then, she knew when to pull back. She was still a foul woman with an even more foul mouth, that much was true, but she was calculated. She was much more composed and thoughtful at times. There was even a time where she acknowledged her daughter’s existence. However, those times were but faded memories in a plethora of dreams in Lauren’s mind.\n\nA few more years went by and the unquenchable thirst for alcohol emerged within her mother. It puzzled both Lauren and her father greatly. Her mother was so detached from reality that she rarely had troubles or actually real-life issues like everyone else — more of being delusional than spoiled — so why she would claim to “drink to forget” was beyond anyone’s knowledge.\n\n“〔Why do you have to be such a sourpuss~~?〕”\n\nFollowing her mother’s words was yet again the sound of more bottles being smashed. It was jarring to the ears, even if Lauren was in a shut room away from where the actual argument was. She had grown accustomed to the quiet for a while that she had almost forgotten how clamorous it was with her parents around.\n\n“〔Would you please stop?〕”\n\n“〔I…〕”\n\nImmediately after, her mother’s wailing filled the house.\n\n“〔I’m sorry… Every time…〕”\n\nWhether this was a genuine reaction or a facade her mother would pull to reel in sympathy, the answer was not clear, even to Lauren. But it worked every time.\n\n“〔Hey… get up, don’t do this.〕”\n\n“〔I… I’m very sorry…〕”\n\n“〔Okay okay, let’s just get you up to your room.〕”\n\nEven as her father complied, he still wasn’t to be taken for a fool. He simply desired no trouble, so he would often take the safest and smartest route to deal with things. The arguments were not short of those methods either. Despite the fact that the arguments would always render his emotions in disarray, he didn’t want to bicker further, he wasn’t even the one that started it.\n\nA case of literary theft: this tale is not rightfully on Amazon; if you see it, report the violation.\n\n“〔No no, I… I wanna see… my baby… I wanna see Lauren.〕”\n\n“...!”\n\nAt that moment, Lauren felt her heart skip a beat. She wondered how her father felt as well. It was usual for her mother to break down after an argument or regret her actions as a way to “sober up.”\n\nBut that last part… was entirely bizarre. Her name rarely passed her mother’s tongue if not ever.\n\n“〔... S-She’s asleep right now. Come on, let’s get you up.〕”\n\nHer father’s response was a sound one, and yet it somewhat irked her. She was torn between the desire to see her mother with possible affection and the desire to push her away just like she pushed them all away once.\n\nThere was no possible way her mother would suddenly shift tone, especially towards her whom she never batted an eye to, be it the alcohol speak or the sobriety waking her up.\n\n「I’m tired…」\n\nGrowing tired of everything, Lauren let out a deep exhale that was barely audible to the ears. She desired change. She wished for something new. An adventure down the rabbit hole into a wonderland, or a magical flight along with the dust to neverland was what she wished for. Pure fantasy. Be that as it may, if that fantasy was indeed true, there would be no taste to it without…\n\n「…without him…」\n\nShe tightened her grip around the sheets to the bed she was lying on. The mattress to the bed was so soft and nearly engulfed anyone that touched it. It felt as if she could drown within it and find herself in an ocean, and that… was something she very much needed at the moment.\n\nBefore she had realized it, the house had gone quiet again.\n\nThere was no sign of her mother’s voice, or of her father’s voice. No sound of glass shattering ever came through again.\n\nIt was complete silence.\n\nEven then, that was not surprising. This was always how the arguments would end.\n\nAt that moment, the door to her bedroom opened and a figure stood in the doorway. He was a man, seemingly in his forties, with a below medium build, neither too skinny nor too muscular but it was still clear that he would need a meal or two to adjust his appearance. Fatigue built up around his eyes, and yet he looked at Lauren with warmth. That man was her father.\n\nNot in the mood for chatter, Lauren rolled to the other side of the bed and faced the desk — her bed was in the middle of the room after all, with the door just on the other side of it.\n\n“Hey…,” her father carefully whispered, his tone maintaining a bit of affability.\n\nBut still, she would not utter a word. As much as she wanted to push him as much as she wanted to talk to him, her mind was fighting itself. She did not know why. One thing was for certain, she desired nothing from others until she got what she wanted, and that included her father — not that her mother ever talked to her.\n\nSeeing as there was no response but subtle rejection from her, her father walked in and sat on the edge to the other side of the bed. Yet again, she inched further away from him, almost reaching the edge on her side.\n\n“Are you… okay?” Her father asked.\n\n“I’m fine,” she mumbled, but it was quiet enough that he was able to hear her.\n\n「Now leave me alone.」\n\nWhy was she anxious? Why did she want to push him away? She didn’t know the answer. Every word he uttered would cause pain to throb in her heart. It was an irritating matter. So rather than willingly wanting to avoid her father, it was something done on instinct.\n\nStill, her father persisted. “Are you sure?” He was not convinced, “It’s not like you to lock yourself in when I come home.”\n\nWhenever her father returned after being away from home for a while, she’d shower him with greetings and chatter about what she did in school. Of course, it could be a matter of growing up and not seeing the fun in the little things. However, he believed she would not be the type to do that unless something else was troubling her.\n\n“You know you can talk to me, right?”\n\n「Just leave me alone.」\n\nHe sighed, “Not you too…”\n\n“Gh…!” She grit her teeth before she raised her torso and turned to look at her father with anger. “Get out!!!”\n\n“Huh?!” Her father quickly stood up in surprise.\n\n“I said Get ouuuuut!!!!” She grabbed a pillow and threw it at her father as she screamed at the top of her lungs, “I’m tired of everything! Just leave me alone!!!”\n\n“Lauren what is—”\n\nHellbent on pushing her father away, Lauren got up to her feet, grabbed the pillow off the ground, and threw it once again at her father, who was absolutely in disbelief at what was happening around him. She used up all her strength pushing him out of the room as he tried to reason with her. He was much taller than her but his weak physique was more than enough for her to overpower him.\n\nFinally, he was out in the hallway. They stood facing each other. One with complete shock in his eyes, and one with hatred seething in her eyes.\n\n“Sweetie please—”\n\n“Why…” She muttered. Even as she spoke with clear madness, there were tears flooding her eyes, “Why won’t you hit me…?”\n\n“W-What are you talking about? Why would I—”\n\n“I hit you, that’s what I did! I did something wrong! I should be punished! But why… why won’t you hit me… why won’t you stop me…” She covered her face with her hands, holding back more tears.\n\nBefore her father could respond, she quickly shut the door in his face and dropped to her knees.\n\nShe was now all alone in her room, once again.\n\nHis comment had irritated her in a way unimaginable. She knew who he was comparing her to. Because that was how it always started — the downfall. Just a few more episodes of lashing out like that and she would end up just like that woman her father was comparing her to. He was comparing her to her good-for-nothing mother. That mother that hadn’t a care for the world to anyone but herself. That mother that was out of her mind almost all the time. That woman that would coat her lies with the spew of booze. That woman that pretended to still love her when she never ever did in the first place. That bitc—\n\n“Why won’t you hit her…,” she sniffled, “Why won’t you stop her…”\n\n「What am I doing…?」\n\nFor a moment, she stopped and thought about that question.\n\nEven as she cried her heart out from her pent-up emotions on the floor, she was still perplexed. No matter how bad things were for her, she would never lash out at her own father. No matter what her mother did, she would never think ill of her. These thoughts weren’t her own. These actions weren’t her own.\n\n「Why… why am I like this…?」\n\nWith no answer coming up in her mind, she stomped her grip and feet on the ground before she buried her head between her knees. She had reached the tail end of the agonizing journey within her mind.\n\n「I… I just wish I could… I want to…」\n\nIt was then… that she felt the surface of a flimsy texture beneath her feet. She leisurely raised her head and looked at her feet. There were several sheets of paper scattered across the floor.\n\nLauren was puzzled.\n\nNo memory of papers being thrown ever came up in her head. But it was at that exact second that she remembered. Those sheets of paper were hidden right under her pillow, the one that she had just thrown a few minutes ago. So it was likely that they were caught in the “crossfire” and were scattered across the room, unbeknownst to her.\n\n“Great… just great,” she silently scoffed.\n\nGathering herself up, she moved forward to collect the sheets of paper and bundle them together once more.\n\nAs she went on with the process, she tried to remember why she had them placed under her pillow instead of on her desk, or even in the drawer. Sifting through the pages, she vaguely had any memory of ever writing the words within them.\n\nIf one could forget what they had written for a story, they could never forget the words — never.\n\nBut no matter how many times she read through them, they were completely foreign to her. All that she remembered was that she had written them the night before, right as she laid in her bed with nothing but the dim light of the lamp in the room. What was also bizarre was the fact that these were handwritten in ink rather than being computer-generated, meaning that she had written them with a pen, which she rarely ever did.\n\nA story that sprung up in a moment — an unlikely occurrence but not entirely.\n\nWith the way things were at the time, she would likely resort to throwing this “manuscript” immediately in the trash and moving on. There was no time to meddle with something so trivial.\n\nLauren felt a bit of unease in her heart though. She held the bundle of sheets in her hand and looked at it with a troubling gaze. There was no desire to write furthermore, yet that rejection and desire were eating away at her heart all the same.\n\n「What… what would he do?」",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 20 - The Hope\n\nhope /həʊp/\n\ngrounds for believing that something good may happen.\n\nOnce again, the colorless ceiling she looked upon. Once again, the cluttered bed she lied in. Once again, the dimly lit room she locked herself within.\n\nWhat day was it? What time was it? What was going on outside? How long had she been in this room? Where was everyone? Where was the end to this void? These were lingering thoughts in Lauren’s mind she had no answers to.\n\nAnother day. Another—\n\n*ring* *ring*\n\nHer phone was ringing.\n\nLong gone was her desire to answer it.\n\nThe caller was most likely Chloe, like all those other times she wouldn’t shut up, she was the only one who was persistent in calling her almost every day after all. No one else from school ever bothered to care about her so it wasn’t like they suddenly realized her disappearance. Even then, they would have attempted to visit her like that young woman from the other day instead of giving her a call, and it couldn’t have been her as she never gave her number.\n\nPoint was: it was a meaningless call. So why then, should she answer it?\n\n*ring* *ring*\n\nStill, the phone kept ringing. It shook vigorously against the glass surface of her nightstand, echoing an irritating sound in her ears from the vibration. The noise was trying its hardest to attract her attention from one way and another, it wasn’t going to stop. And Lauren was doing everything to suppress it, but not even covering her ears with the pillow was enough.\n\n*ring* *ring*\n\nFor a moment, she felt like throwing the phone again. However, another thought came to her mind. She could simply turn off her phone entirely. There was no point in waiting for other calls, she didn’t expect any after all.\n\n“Leave me alone…,” she scoffed as she removed the pillow off her head and grabbed her phone.\n\nHer vision was blurry for a second, as the phone’s bright screen was the only proper source of light she had laid eyes on for a long while. She tried blinking several times to fully open up her eyes and overcome the dry surface that covered her sight. After rubbing her eyes with her fingers for a bit, her vision finally cleared up.\n\nAnd so, she looked at the phone once more.\n\n“...!”\n\nLike an arrow from a bow, she sprung up off the bed with her eyes wide open in shock. She carefully examined her phone’s screen with disbelief still plastered on her face. Her eyes could not believe what they were seeing—\n\n【(01524) 0807 2003】\n\nThere was no caller ID. Only an unknown number.\n\nHowever, one quick thought came to Lauren. With no time to think further or properly react she quickly answered the phone.\n\n“H-Hel—” She coughed as she struggled to clear her throat. Having not spoken in a normal tone for a while, this was a natural reaction. “Hel… Hello? Hello?”\n\nThere was nothing on the other line.\n\nOnly the sound of the blissful wind echoed in her ears, albeit it was much gruffer due to it coming through the phone. Her heart pumped with great eagerness. Even though there was no answer yet, she felt new life breathe into her body once more. She tightly gripped her phone as she inhaled and let out an exhale several times, ready to speak up if an answer ever came back.\n\n「Come on… answer please…」\n\nIf you come across this story on Amazon, it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.\n\n“{.......................... hey…!}” A voice came through the phone; calm yet downcast. “{I’m sorry for… I’m sorry for not… getting back to you sooner. I kind of… wanted to be on my own for a while.}”\n\nIt sounded like his voice. It sounded exactly like Zachary Ashworth’s voice.\n\nAt that moment, Lauren’s tongue froze.\n\n「Is it really…?」\n\nShe was speechless. No words ever came to her mind and that which she thought of couldn’t be uttered.\n\nNothing moved. Everything halted.\n\nThe world around her came to an indefinite stop. But, at the same time, there were several colors, of an unimaginable magnitude, being splashed across the room, painting the dark and decrepit room with never-before-seen light. This was a moment frozen in time, a moment to be cherished.\n\nIt was the moment Lauren Cherith learned how to live again.\n\n“{Um… aren’t you… going to say something?}” His voice came through once again. It was low-toned, almost brimmed with sorrow, but it still had a tinge of benevolence within. “{Did you forget me? My voice? It’s… me… Zach…}”\n\n「It’s really him!」\n\n“{Wow… you really uh… forgot about me, huh…}”\n\nTears poured down to the ground. A smile, a long-forgotten smile was drawn across her face as she cried.\n\nThere was so much she wanted to say and do, she wanted to shout at him and call him out for his reckless actions, she wanted to scold him for leaving her like that for so long, she wanted to ask him where he was this whole time, she wanted to run out the door to wherever he was at that moment. However, only one proper response came to her mind, “Of course, I didn’t forget you… I’d never forget you,” she sniffled, “... silly!”\n\n“{Ah… ha!}” Zachary chuckled before he started to laugh on the other line.\n\nJoining him, Lauren both laughed and cried at the same time. She couldn’t hold back her tears, but these were tears of joy, and so she also couldn’t help but laugh along with him. If she could do so, she wanted to jump up and down, and bounce on the bed like a child who happily expressed their happiness.\n\n「It’s really him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him! It’s him!」\n\nThey haven’t heard each other’s voices in so long, yet this brief, foolish interaction through the phone was enough to restore almost everything back to the way it was. Despite being limited to only their voices, they both felt like they were standing in front of one another.\n\nOnce the momentary reunion was over, the much-needed questions came back up in Lauren’s mind. “Where… where were you? Where are you right now? Do you have any idea how worr—”\n\n“{Easy easy, calm yourself down, I’ll explain everything.}” Zachary said, “{But don’t you… think we should meet up first?}”\n\n“Y-Yeah, sure. Where are you?” She couldn’t contain her excitement, “I’ll dress up and come to you right now.”\n\n“{R-Right now?! Like right now, right now?! It’s almost sunset though!}”\n\n“I don’t care, I want to see you right now… please.” She didn’t wait all this time for him in that small corner of her life only to postpone their meeting for another time when they were so close to seeing each other. They needed to see each other as soon as possible. She needed that.\n\n“{I…,}” Zachary stopped. There was a brief moment of silence on the other line, Lauren’s expression quickly turned from joy to concern, “{... Fine, let’s meet up at school… the entrance for uh… old time’s sake.}” He chuckled.\n\n“School! Right, right! I’ll be right there!”\n\n“{Woah wait, hold your horses,}” Zachary spoke in a rather concerned tone, “{Are you really sure about this, Lauren?}”\n\n“Yes, absolutely. Now, let's move.”\n\n“{Wow, really that eager, heh.}” He chuckled. “{Well, I’ll see you then.}”\n\n“Of course you will, bye!”\n\nThey bid their short farewells and the call was over.\n\nStill, the world lit up with bright colors everywhere.\n\n「I’m going to meet Zach!」\n\nLauren held the phone closer to her chest, closed her eyes, and then let out a huge sigh of relief. It felt as if someone was choking her the whole time she was kept up in her room and only when she heard Zachary’s voice was she able to finally fend off for herself and get room to breathe.\n\nBut there was no time to dwell on the thoughts of her life returning back. She needed to move quickly.\n\nDone with the call, she rushed to open up her dresser.\n\n「What should I wear?」\n\nShe tapped her chin as she wondered.\n\nAs she went left and right, carefully looking for the right clothes to wear for this celebratory occasion, she noticed something in the corner of her eyes.\n\nIt was the manuscript for the story she had randomly written, lying solemnly on the desk beside the dresser.\n\nFor some reason, she remembered what she had written in that story and began to further understand why she wrote it in the first place. There was a slight correlation between her feelings now and the feelings bundled within that short story. It was all over what she truly desired.\n\nShe held the manuscript in her hands and looked at it with a smile, “It’s a wonderful land!”\n\nPlacing it back on the desk, Lauren went back to her search for a dress.\n\nThis was a moment she could not believe was possible.\n\n「I’m going to meet Zach!」",

Despite that, they can never stand on equal ground in the eyes of others.\n\nThe maiden, a woman of refined nature that knew how to stand fiercely for herself, was coated in red that shone a flaming beam should her path be lost in the dark. She is the eldest and the pride of her family. Whatever she desires, she can get. The girl, a blind young lady that did not yet know the dangers in the chasm of reality, hid behind an achromat, for her light was of great contrast to her sister's. Her entire figure is of pure white — colorless — nothing else. Whatever she desires, she can never get. Being the black sheep of her family, she's never given a chance for anything whatsoever.\n\nTruth be told, blood does not tie them together.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nAs a child, the girl was lost, drifting across the ocean like a wooden plank from a sunken ship — a child of the ocean.\n\nWith no memory of who she was or where she was from, she was left terribly fragile. There was nothing but a weary, immemorial book in her possession.\n\nFortunately, luck would have her be found ashore on the beach of a family of great riches and even greater authority of a monarchy. Out of kindness, her foster mother took her into her family. The family desired to deny her existence but they could not stand against the word of the mother. She treated her as if she was her own child, with unconditional kindness; a kindness not even shown to her own child, who was more or less left in the care of the family.\n\nBut that kindness was soon stripped away, remaining only as a fleeting memory.\n\nOnce the mother was stricken with illness, everyone laid blame on the poor girl. They claimed the time the mother took for that girl, the time she spent raising her, showering her with misplaced and undeserved love, withered her mind and reduced her to the sorry state that ultimately resulted in her unfortunate death.\n\nNow with the mother gone, the family that always rejected her, was finally able to erase her existence from memory. To them, the girl was a parasite, a plague with estranged and tainted blood that couldn't be tied to the \"esteemed\" reputation of the family. This was a family of royal prestige and spineless nob.\n\nThey aimed for perfection. A crippled girl was a mere waste to be erased.\n\nBut even so, the eldest daughter, the neglected child of the mother of all people, opposed the family.\n\nFor the family, who thought their maiden would stand with them, they were in shock. No matter how hard they tried to wrap their heads around it, they couldn't understand why one of their own, and the most affected by the girl's presence, desired to defend her.\n\nBelieving such an act to be blasphemous, the family attempted to get rid of them both.\n\nAnd so the maiden, the eldest daughter, took her sister's hand and ran away.\n\nAfter all, that family couldn't understand; couldn’t comprehend its meaning: unconditional love; the love of siblings who had no one but each other.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nThe sisters walk and walk a long road they did not know the end of yet.\n\nIt doesn’t matter where they are going or what they are going to do, where they went or what they did. Whether they knew something or knew nothing, it didn't matter at all. They need to keep moving forward.\n\nAlthough the girl is blind, her older sister always tells her of what she sees, her words never to leave her mouth and her voice never to leave her younger sister's ears, for those are the only things her sister has for a world.\n\nHowever, the older sister does not perceive color. She sees reality only for what it really is and not for what some glorified words in a storybook can describe. Even with a monotonous tone in her voice following the narration, her younger sister still loves them. The younger sister perceives the color in the world she sees but she cannot see. And yet, she does not envy her, only continuing to shower her with the love and kindness her mother rarely gave her.\n\nShe desires nothing but the wishes and safety of her sister. Whatever she desires, she will grant it for her.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nIn a town, far from the clutches of that sickly family, the sisters come across an old bookstore — a rarity. The older sister desires to take shelter from the heat of the barren wasteland, and her sister desires to know what encases that building.\n\nNaturally whelmed with curiosity, they walk in.\n\nWandering through the old bookstore, the sisters find nothing but simple picture books, lacking words of any kind, only made to be admired by image alone. Even the books that once held text within had their pages either torn off or carefully redacted so as to not taint the pictures accompanying them.\n\nTo the older sister, this is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nIn this world, the people cannot read; the people cannot learn.\n\nIgnorance exists and persists. It thrives to trap the people in a never-ending spiral of mindless dreams, locking and holding them back from attaining true knowledge. Still, they sing praises for it, without ever knowing the meaning of their songs.\n\nThe people will not learn; the people will not read. Such is the state of this world.\n\nAfter all, what is a barren world but a prison to the people?\n\nThe older sister mustn’t do anything about it. She mustn’t say a word—\n\nHowever, the sisters soon discover a bizarre dilapidated book, one that is hidden in plain sight within the shelves of the bookstore.\n\nUnlike the other books, it doesn’t have pictures, rather in their place are words. Its ancient text is barely recognizable in the older sister’s eyes.\n\nThis book belongs to the age of Oldworld, an age that precedes both the sisters’ lives by millennia upon millennia. It’s something that mustn’t exist in this age under any circumstance.\n\nBut then…\n\n'I want to read that,' says the younger sister.\n\nFacing this obstacle, the older sister hushes her younger sister, pushing her aside to the corners of the store to avoid the eyes and ears. She explains the dangers of doing such a thing but still tries her best to chronicle what she sees to her younger sister.\n\nIt’s her wish after all.\n\nAnd at that moment, the most peculiar thing happens.\n\n‘I can read it,’ says her sister.\n\nThe older sister can’t believe it.\n\nBut once again, her sister reads the text. Somehow her blind sister is able to read the ancient text. Is this a miracle? A dream? Or something else entirely?\n\nYet another talent for the girl who lives in darkness.\n\n‘She can read?!’ The old man gasps in fear, for not only is it impossible for a blind girl such as herself to read, while also having a blindfold shielding her eyes, but the mere mention of that word holds terrible weight in this land.\n\nUnauthorized reproduction: this story has been taken without approval. Report sightings.\n\nThe older sister looks back at the man. Sweat is pouring down their faces as their eyes interlock with fear and determination. She is willing to do anything to protect her sister and he is willing to go to great lengths to understand what lay in front of his eyes.\n\n‘This part is kind of creepy. Do you still want me to read it?’ Asks the younger sister, completely oblivious to the tension in the air. ‘Sis?’\n\n‘I… I think we should leave. Come on leave the book’\n\n‘Wait!’\n\nShouts the old man.\n\n‘Damn it all! That was too loud. Listen, I know you can’t trust me but there is something you must know.’\n\nThe older sister relaxes her posture while the younger sister clings to her back.\n\n‘There is a man who comes asking about this very book every once in a while. I don’t know why but I suspect he’s looking for someone who can read it.’\n\n‘And that is our problem, how?’ Asks the older sister.\n\nThe old man grabs her by the shoulders and stares into her eyes.\n\n‘I don’t know what he’ll do but I know he’s not here to carry you off to some paradise.’\n\nKnocK KnocK\n\nThe sisters and the old man are startled.\n\nKnocK KnocK\n\nKnocK KnocK\n\nHe is here.\n\nBehind the front door is a silhouette coated in black. Unmoving, unchanging.\n\nThe old man panics and throws the book into a bag.\n\n‘Take it!’\n\nHe forces the bag into the older sister’s hands and pulls her to the back of the store.\n\n‘Use the backdoor. Run until you get to shore and there you should find a ship that’ll keep you safe for a while.’\n\n‘Why should I trust you?!’ Asks the older sister.\n\n‘My brother used it once but if you have a better idea be my guest.’\n\nWith one forceful push that used all of the old man’s might, he forces the sisters outside and locks the door.\n\nBefore she has a chance to ask more questions, she hears the shelves collapse and decides to follow the only lead she has.\n\nAnd so, the sisters walk again, leaving the old bookstore.\n\nOne is brimming with joy and the other is riddling with mystery.\n\nThe road is still long, the older sister thinks.\n\nShe must protect her sister.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nThe sisters move through the town.\n\nThe older sister’s eyes twitch at the slightest hint of movement. Every shadow becomes a possible hiding spot for those would-be attackers.\n\nSuddenly… she feels someone grab her leg.\n\nIt’s her sister.\n\n“Is something wro—”\n\nHer words are interrupted by the hunger of her sister.\n\n“Oh… I see.”\n\nThey cannot afford to slow down but cannot afford to starve, so a decision is made.\n\nThey stop by a market and buy stuffed bread with what little money they have. The seller mentions a recent incident at the bookstore, but the older sister ignores it and leaves with her sister in hand.\n\n“Mmmmmmm this is really good!” Says the younger sister.\n\nHer smile is almost contagious. As if she isn’t aware of the shadow of danger that looms over them.\n\nAt times like this, the older sister wished to be as blissfully blind as her sister.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nBeyond the outskirts of town, beyond the veil of society is a long and winding road of nature.\n\nIt was not by man’s hand that the road had a direction but it was part of a grander design. It did not matter who or what you were, for nature would always guide you through subtle cues.\n\nNone of this mattered to the one who can see it. All she sees is a path towards a new life; a life of freedom, dignity and love.\n\nHer younger sister cannot perceive such beauty but still, she is captivated by it.\n\nShe would stumble as the two walked through. She would catch a new smell or notice a strange sound which would give her pause for only a moment before her sister dragged her away.\n\nThey arrive at a cliffside.\n\nThe older sister is confused.\n\nDid she take a wrong turn? Did she get lost along the way? The shore was barely visible but it would be impossible to make it without food or water.\n\n‘I-Is something wrong?’ The younger sister asks.\n\nHer sister says it’s alright but it’ll be difficult.\n\n‘She was certainly right about things being difficult.’\n\nThat was… a new voice. One the young girl had never heard before.\n\n‘As for you… give me the book and it’ll all be fine.’\n\nWhere? When? Who? What? A million questions danced around the girl’s head bouncing around the walls of her mind. Becoming more and more stressful by the second. She is hot, cold, dry, wet— Wet?\n\nWet?\n\nWhen?\n\nWhen did she ever get wet?\n\n…\n\n‘Seems like she’s not all there,’ a voice cries out from the back.\n\n‘Yeah, seems so,’ the original voice replies.\n\nBut where was her sister?\n\nWait… she’s wet.\n\nHer senses come rushing back; flooding her brain with sensation.\n\nShe was not wet. She was soaking, dripping.\n\nThe air around her was filled with a foul aroma and her soundscape was only that of running water.\n\n‘What about the body?’\n\n‘Who cares, just toss it over the cliff!’\n\n‘You think anyone will notice her?’\n\n‘Who even comes around these parts, just dump her and move on!’\n\n‘Maybe next time the boss should keep her in one piece.’\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nThe voices were so far, far away…\n\n…the sensations were not.\n\nA presence closes in and it smells of pestilence.\n\n‘Your book is rather important.’\n\nIt says.\n\n‘Can I borrow it?

There wasn’t a wonderful land beyond the seas that spoke of fables. There was no path to escape from reality. None of these sparks of jubilation existed here. The once mystifying embers that lit the lost corners of her mind and heart were starting to fade away.\n\nOnly an image of a twilight sky reflected in her eyes. The gentle breeze of the wind brushed against her face, offering comfort for the colorless.\n\nBut what she felt was not at all comforting. The world around her spiraled.\n\nWhere she was supposed to joyfully dream, she felt rage — anger.\n\nWhere she was supposed to follow along, she felt lost — confusion.\n\nWhere she was supposed to feel safe, she was afraid — fear.\n\nBundled up together, all these feelings suddenly rushed to her.\n\nAnd then she looked down to the world around her.\n\n“...!”\n\nNothing but shock coated her eyes. It was then that she truly realized where she had gone — long gone was the fable of the little girl.\n\nHer feet barely standing on the edge, she was one step away from reality to endless sleep from which there was no return.\n\n「What am I doing here?」\n\n“L-Lauren!!” A voice desperately called out to her from behind.\n\nIt was a familiar voice, one that she had last heard before unknowingly drifting off to her dreams. This was the only voice she would never lose trust in, the only voice that offered her true comfort. But now, that voice was shaken, afraid.\n\nCareful of her movement, Lauren tilted her head to look at the owner of that sorrowful, yet wonderful voice.\n\nThere, a few meters away from where her feet trembled, stood a young man.\n\nWith his natural blonde hair and violet eyes, his appearance marked the benchmark of a youth that knew nothing but a bright-colored world.\n\nHowever, that young man wasn’t standing there to be marveled upon by onlookers. Beyond that facade, there was a genuine look of worry. His irises had shrunk so much, it spoke of the fright in his eyes. Sweat was dripping down from the side of his forehead and to his cheeks.\n\nEven then, the light never faded from his face.\n\nThat young man was Zachary Ashworth.\n\n“L-Lauren, please,” he struggled to maintain a straight voice from the fear clearly clouding his mind, “Come back… This… this isn’t a joke!”\n\nAs he spoke, he took small steps forward, with his arms shot straight to the front should he ever need to act quickly.\n\nTo all this, Lauren had but one question.\n\nUnauthorized use: this story is on Amazon without permission from the author. Report any sightings.\n\n「What’s… what’s going on?」\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nDespite being the one who initiated the occasion, Zachary Ashworth was not ready for it.\n\nThe time he called Lauren was the first time he opened his new phone since his old one was damaged beyond repair in the accident. Be that as it may, he was still not prepared. He hadn’t expected her to answer the call.\n\nSeeing as the meeting spot was the school grounds, he took the quick option and decided to wear his school uniform. It was a stupid decision but one that he had to take — he was not exactly keen on being fashionable before. Thinking about it now, he thought perhaps a little extra accessory wouldn’t have hurt to have on.\n\n“Should I have gotten dad’s watch?” He mumbled to himself as he rubbed the back of his head.\n\nDropping his lower lip in wonder, he gazed with puzzled eyes at the empty street before him. A few bicycles were parked on the side here and there, most likely belonging to the kids in the basketball court overlooking the school building. Other than that, the whole area was beyond deserted.\n\nThe sun was still up in the sky but it was slowly being covered by the screen of nightfall. It was almost sunset.\n\n“Will she even make it?” Zachary sighed. He remembered how it was announced recently that the tram supposedly stopped one hour before sunset.\n\nNot another moment to dwell on the question, he noticed the answer was shining clearly not too far from where he stood.\n\nOn the sidewalk, near the basketball court’s fences, a girl suddenly emerged.\n\nGarnering strange looks from the kids in the court, she ran with frustration, her style elegant yet clumsy. A second later, she was crossing the empty street toward Zachary. After finally arriving at the meeting spot, she took a moment to catch her breathing, resting her hands on her knees.\n\nUpon seeing her like that, one could jokingly drop a comment about how chaotic she seemed to the onlookers, or how sweat ran down on almost all of her skin. That was the response of a prudish reality.\n\nBut not for him; not from him.\n\nAlready, his mouth was agape.\n\nHaving been done with her fill of rest, the jaded girl rose upwards and shot him a straight look of surprise. Her brunette hair hung loosely instead of being tied to her usual ponytail. To add a bit of more flavor to this “new” appearance, she seemed all dolled up for this meeting, arraying herself within a beige sundress beneath and a blue jacket to shield her from the occasional gusts of cold.\n\nIt was no surprise why her beauty was a sight to behold. The light and flames of a star were not something easy to put out. And that girl was (once) the brightest of them all: the evershine star.\n\nLauren Cherith had finally arrived.\n\n“Um…,” Zachary was lost for words. He could not help but admire her only.\n\nA smile ran across Lauren’s face, one that was brimming with the light of joy, a genuine smile. Like passing a baton, it was now time again for her to take the lead. She pushed her legs forward and embraced him with much-needed warmth.\n\nBurying her face in his chest, she spoke in a muffled voice, “It’s really you!”\n\nOnce again, he was speechless. “I…,” he lacked the decision for a proper response. Nevertheless, he closed his eyes and gladly accepted the embrace, drowning himself within it.\n\nIt didn’t matter if she was covered in sweat. It didn’t matter if his attire was dull. None of that mattered in the face of this moment. This was a reunion.\n\nThe two lost in a colorless world were finally reunited.\n\nThe lost boy, who chased after the girl’s light. The lost girl, who wanted shelter in the boy’s light. They had caught onto each other.\n\n「...」\n\nAfter a minute of embrace, Lauren gently pulled herself away and looked at Zachary’s legs. “You’re… walking?”\n\nLast she had heard in the hospital was that the accident might have resulted in him losing his legs almost entirely. Yet here he was, in perfect health, walking with two fully functional legs.\n\n“Yeah…” He moved around to show how his legs were working normally.\n\nIt was a miracle.\n\nLauren smiled, “W-Well, that doesn’t matter right now. Where were you this entire time?”\n\n“...” He had expected this question.\n\nHowever, something else caught his attention which left him tranced for a bit.\n\nIt was Lauren’s crystal eyes. They had somewhat looked odd from his perspective. Those eyes always glistened with light so bright and hopeful; they’d be the first thing he would want to look at whenever he felt down. But now that light was dim, faded, almost gone entirely from her eyes.\n\nStill, Lauren kept on her smile, one that was slightly clouded by gloom rather than the usual beam.\n\n“I was… busy with other stuff,” he held back his words before then giving an apologetic smile as he scratched the back of his head, “You could say I was broadening my horizons!”\n\n“Huh?!”\n\nLauren tilted her head in confusion. Her smile had completely faded.\n\n‘Without me?’ She thought.\n\nYet it was very obvious from his looks in Lauren’s eyes. His posture. His tone. His behavior. They had changed. All of them were coated in an aura of confidence that was very unlike who he was before. All of this made him seem open and willingly trying to engage with the world around him. He had changed.\n\nThe boy ran ahead of the girl, surpassing her — an ironic twist of fate.",

With the kids in the field, the few teachers down in their offices, and the janitor cleaning up the halls, this was the only place where they could have a moment of peace for themselves.\n\nThe sky’s twilight luminescence offered them a tranquil shade to take shelter under. Adding to that serenity was the wind blowing gently in a soothing atmosphere. Not a person was in sight nor a voice could be heard. They were perfectly alone. Everything was nice.\n\n“So you were on a trip, huh.” Lauren faintly uttered.\n\nAs Zachary had explained, he had been trying to broaden his horizons, to learn more about the world around him rather than being kept up in his room for weeks on end — something that Lauren had taught him to do in the first place. The best option to do with that while recovering was for him to leave the town entirely for a while, he believed a change of pace was in order.\n\nYet Lauren was puzzled. She never imagined someone like him would ever do something so different.\n\n“I realized something after the accident,” he explained. “I’ve… never really done anything with my life, and the fact that I almost lost it for just being a pessimistic moron — a snob — I… I was scared. I felt my whole life play in front of me on repeat every day. I know this is gonna sound preachy, but it felt like… a calling? Like, you know.” He chuckled at his poor choice of words.\n\nAlthough his words might have seemed like the prattle of a fraud acting as a cultist, they were true. His voice was loud, clear, and concise. There was a tone of enthusiasm echoing from within, one that replicated the genuineness of the passion he had once heard and seen.\n\n“It’s then tha▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓”\n\nHis words faded, shifting to the static notes of white noise. It had been fully engulfed by the lonely wind, leaving Lauren all by herself with her thoughts.\n\nShe stood there, solemnly staring into the abyss, as the cheerful charlatan went on with the conversation, and yet…\n\n…she couldn’t hear him; she didn’t want to hear him.\n\nNot a care in the world was plastered on her face, despite being with him.\n\n「What the hell…?」\n\nThis was Zachary, but the one in front of her was anyone but him, he was hardly recognizable at all. This was supposed to be the boy she had been dying to meet this entire time, the one whose thoughts brought her nothing but anguish and pain.\n\nWhenever she thought about him, her heart would beat, both from yearning and fear. Back then, he was someone she could find shelter within, even with his pessimism, he was still truthful, still pragmatic. Perhaps he was hard to reach at first due to the walls he had built around himself from years of ineptitude.\n\nHowever, now… the walls were gone and so was he.\n\nIt felt as if he tore it down and then ran as far away as he could beyond it until nothing of him remained.\n\nThe man that stood before her wasn’t Zachary. He brought no feeling to her heart.\n\nShe eyed him a look; his voice returned.\n\n“▓▓▓▓▓ust say it was perfectly timed as well, it really helped me in more ways than one▓▓▓▓▓”\n\nHis voice would fade and come back again. Like she had been tuning the radio from one channel to the other, trying to find the right and clear frequency, all in an effort to simply “hear.”\n\nBut that begged the question: did she want to hear it?\n\n“▓▓▓▓▓as THAT guy?! Talk about the embodiment of self-angst.”\n\nAll smiles, self-boasts, and no awareness of the world around him — not even to the girl beside him whose eyes told a somber tale.\n\nIf there was one thing that remained from the “old” him, it was his tendency for being self-absorbed, which in itself was self-destructive from both sides, be it within someone with prudish optimism or a coward hiding within their own cynical bubble.\n\n“Guess you could say I was enlightened,” he gave a wry smile, “But again▓▓▓▓▓”\n\nShe looked away; his voice faded.\n\nLowering her head, she turned to rest it on the ledge with her arms beneath. The rooftop’s ledge covered almost all of their bodies, which made it a good spot to rest beside. She had completely ignored Zachary’s presence, opting to rest away from him. There was hardly any doubt he even noticed her movement.\n\nWhat was with him? Lauren was bewildered.\n\nEver since they met up with each other, he had been acting as if nothing happened, as if he hadn’t been gone for a while. Although he did acknowledge it, he was treating it like he was only gone for a few days, and the only excuse he had was a “retreat.” It might be excusable given time.\n\nBut he disappeared for almost an entire month without a word.\n\n「Not a word; not a single word from him.」\n\nAnd now that he came back, he was different.\n\nIt was all him, him, and him, but he was not himself. The guy she knew was one shrouded in a cloud of pessimism. There was so much one had to do in order to get to him, to understand him, to be able to talk with him normally. For that, he was different.\n\n「But he seems happy…」\n\nShe wanted to be happy for him but—\n\n「…」\n\nLauren gazed at the twilight sky with dull eyes. The wind howled, puffing out a faint gust that ran through her hair, slightly messing it up.\n\nBut that didn’t matter. If even the guy she desperately waited for to pull her out of this pit, wasn’t of any help — the guy she believed would color her world once again — then none of it mattered.\n\n“...”\n\nMelancholy existed; it persisted.\n\n“▓▓▓▓▓ey,” Zachary’s voice returned, “Are you even listening?”\n\nLauren looked at him while still resting her head, he was giving her a concerned and rather disturbed expression — one that she had seen on several faces for the past few weeks. He had finally noticed her odd presence.\n\n“You okay?”\n\n“...,” she averted her lifeless gaze back to the sky before quietly responding in a monotonous voice, “...Why would you think I’m not?”\n\n“Well… you’re hardly ever speaking,” he pursued his lips, “And…” he pointed a finger at her, “It looks like you’re not even listening, I thought you wanted to know where I was?”\n\nStill, with her eyes not moving an inch, she answered, “...who says I’m not…?”\n\n“I mean, it’s kind of weird for me to keep talking without you showing any interest. It’s not like you not to talk.”\n\nThere was no response on Lauren’s side, her gaze was fixed on the abyss.\n\nUsually, she would be the one to lead the conversation but now she completely fell silent. For a moment, she thought of speaking up, but the words wouldn’t come out. She didn’t have it in her to start them. They were too much, carrying a weight that didn’t suit anyone’s liking; better for her to shut up and remain silent.\n\nInstead, she went back to bury her head between her arms on the ledge.\n\n“I’ve been blabbering too much, haven’t I?” Zachary spoke with a calm and amiable voice.\n\nIt wasn’t necessarily because of his endless; she liked his endless chatter on the contrary. As a matter of fact, she was happy to hear his voice like this.\n\nBut it was all just—\n\nIf you spot this tale on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\n\n「It’s not…」\n\nHitting a slump in her thoughts, she kneeled to the ground and sat beside where Zachary stood, leaning her back and head opposite the ledge. Like a child lost and alone, she retreated her legs near her face, wrapping her arms around, and then burying her face once again within them.\n\nShe let out a deep sigh.\n\nTo Zachary, it seemed like she was hiding from him. Nevertheless, he too shared a sigh with her.\n\n“Enough about me, then,” he nudged her shoe with his, “Anything interesting happened while I was gone?”\n\nThere was no response.\n\n“Come on…!” He said in a tired, yet playful tone. Feeling like he could help her out, he followed her lead to the ground and sat beside her. “Like I said, enough about me. I’m listening.”\n\nComplying with his request, although she felt rather forced, she tilted her head to the side, eying him a mysterious look.\n\nZachary couldn’t tell exactly what her face was expressing as it was mostly coated by strands of her hair. For almost an entire minute, she stared at him with the most solemn gaze, the corners of her mouth slightly facing downward.\n\n“Uh… how’s school?” He tried to initiate a conversation.\n\n“...I don’t know…,” she woefully answered, her dull eyes never leaving his sight, as if stuck in a trance.\n\n“I… I see…,” he scratched his head. Such an ordeal was way behind Zachary’s skills to deal with. “Well, how’s your book going?”\n\n“...I don’t know…,” she said. Yet again, the same answer in the same lifeless tone.\n\nStill, he tried, “Why? I thought you said they contacted you. Did they not?”\n\n“...no…,” a different answer came out of her mouth this time.\n\nDespite his initial surprise when he heard her response, he continued, thinking not all hope had plummeted yet, “W-Why? Why would they not?”\n\n“...I don’t know…,” her answer shifted back even after the conversation had moved somewhat.\n\n“But that’s absolutely insane beyond measure. You’re the winner for God’s sake. Did you not contact them about it?”\n\n“....I……,” she pursed her lips and averted his gaze to think for a minute.\n\nEven in her downcast mood, the beauty of her face never faded. It would make anyone feel almost envious. However, she did not care about that.\n\nHer mind was in a state of disarray. She was puzzled once again over Zachary’s concern. When did he ever truly show care to someone? And even if he did, he never knew how to provide for someone, to help someone. He lacked the ability to stand on his own two feet without support.\n\nSo why, now, was he doing this?\n\nHe was riddling her mind with questions that he most likely had the answers to given the way she seemed to be. For someone who preferred to waste time, he was surely wasting it in avoiding accepting the truth.\n\n“...You’re weird, you know…,” she uttered in the same low tone.\n\n“Huh?!”\n\nHearing a response, she looked at him. There were both sad and shocked expressions on his face. After seeing that, she could not help but look away again and bury her face between her legs.\n\n“...,” she sighed, “...I’m weird…”\n\nBut Zachary did not hear her, he was too focused on the response before, “Wait? Is it because of me? Is that why you didn’t contact them? Am I the problem?”\n\n「It’s not you…」\n\nShe had her eyes lost in thought as she bit the tip of her nail.\n\n「It’s me…」\n\nZachary wasn’t the only one who changed.\n\nWhat was with her?\n\nLauren was bewildered.\n\nAs the honor student, she was a model student who followed the rules and did well in her school. She was always cheerful and handing out greetings here and there for anyone she passed. She was a girl with a passion raptured by flames that never went out.\n\nHowever, for the longest time now, that model and the ideal type of student was gone, that flame of passion within her had been extinguished.\n\nShe was not herself. These thoughts were not her own.\n\nIf that was truly the case, what right did she have to avoid answering him? She had changed just as much as him, albeit for the worse it might seem.\n\nFor the truth was, she was simply projecting her change onto his and pretending to be of the same nature. In reality, none of his changes were ever really bad. He had completely grown over his past self. And so for that—\n\n“...It’s my fault,” she finally spoke up, catching his attention.\n\n「Don’t mess this up!」\n\n“...It’s my fault… it’s my fault that things got—” she paused before running her hands through her hair in frustration, “Ugh… I don’t think I can do this.”\n\n「I just can’t…」\n\nA few seconds passed, she was still holding her hands over her head. As with how the conversation was going, she expected a remark but… it never came.\n\nThere was no response on Zachary’s side.\n\nConfused, she turned to look at him. His face was still with a faint smile. No reaction whatsoever. That was his way of staying completely silent, committing to the fact that he was going to listen to her.\n\n「Right… I can do this.」\n\nLauren took another moment for herself to recollect her thoughts.\n\n「It’s Zach. No one strange.」\n\n“...you disappeared…,” she turned her sight to the ground, “I thought you were avoiding me. When I realized I never got the chance to say sorry for back then, I felt guilt, and it’s been eating away at me ever since. But that’s not the problem…”\n\n「...」\n\n“School, my parents, my friends, everything felt dull!” Her voice had shifted to an even lower tone, “Everything became a problem and it was harder and harder to bear… All these expectations of me…,” her tongue halted. She lacked the words for more, “I’m just tired… I don’t know what this is.”\n\n「...and that’s it…」\n\nEverything turned quiet after she finished her explanation.\n\nYet again, there was no response.\n\n「...Is he mad at me?」\n\nLooking back at him, she noticed his face had been stuck to that of a dumbfounded expression. It almost frightened her how static he was with his expressions.\n\n“So that’s it?!” Zachary turned from surprise to immediate laughter. “Haha!”\n\n「What…?!!」\n\nLaughter… that was his reaction.\n\nIt had shocked her that it almost woke her up from the trance she was falling in. His cackle broke the total silence they were enraptured within. It echoed loudly throughout the place; the kids down the street could have even heard it as well.\n\n“You were having a depressive episode…,” he clarified.\n\n“Huh…,” she went from feeling shocked to curious.\n\n“Wow, never had one, huh,” he realized, “I’m sorry for laughing like this but I… I’m just so used to it that I can recognize it. Just like that!”\n\n“You… were like this?”\n\n「Of course, he was…」\n\n“Yeah, but then after traveling I just realized how close-minded I was to fall for it. I was actively avoiding anything social and thought poor of anyone who tried to engage with me. I didn’t listen to anyone.” He crossed his legs, “That’s the one thing I’m glad to get rid of.”\n\n「So that’s how it is…」\n\nLauren had gone quiet.\n\nOut of everyone around her, he was with the one who truly understood what these insecurities entailed to a person. And it was exactly because he knew that he had the desire to change, even if it was slightly misguided at times.\n\nKnowing that, she believed he would understand her. But instead, he was treating it with a laugh, completely disregarding what she had said and what she meant by her words. Not even he was able to understand her.\n\nDespite him being the one who offered to listen to her problems, he was the one who was pushing it away. The conversation suddenly shifted to him again.\n\n“Guess you could say I was enlightened,” he gave a wry smile, “A welcome change!”\n\n「Change…」\n\nThere was no denying it.\n\nChange. Unexplained and bizarre change was simply crawling all over them. It was there from the start. It was there when she first came to this town that was once filled with hope. It was there when she had heard of the bizarre incident around town. It was everywhere. It took only a little bit of time. It was in everyone.\n\nHe had changed.\n\nShe had changed.\n\nBut why?\n\n“...”\n\n「It’s all because of this town…」\n\nShe had to stop denying it. The longer she stayed in the town, the faster it issued change, feasting on the loneliness within. The longer she was alone, the better the void pulled her in.\n\n「It’s all because of this world…」\n\nBeing left alone to themselves when they had no one but each other to understand was the reason for all that. When they were alone, the world aimed to control them how it deemed fit.\n\nShe changed, she believed for the worse.\n\nHe changed, he believed for the better.\n\nYet in the end, it was a change neither desired.\n\n「I’m tired of it.」\n\nIf they ran away from it all together, then perhaps…\n\n“...!”\n\nShe had found a solution.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nBoth Zachary and Lauren were still sitting on the ground with their backs to the wall of the ledge. They hadn’t uttered a word to each other for a while, yet they were in their own worlds contrasting to one another.\n\nZachary sat with a bright expression, taking in the peaceful atmosphere of nightfall around him. Lauren, on the other hand, still had her face buried in her arms and between her legs.\n\nThe weather was nice.\n\n「That’s it…」\n\nZachary liked it.\n\nIt was neither too cold or too hot, perfectly made for the short time of fall. Soon, winter and its snowstorm would arrive, so it was nice to enjoy the weather with this freedom whilst they still could.\n\nOnce again, the wind roared against them.\n\nAfter the gust had cleared, there wasn’t a single sound echoing in the atmosphere, not even the wind. Only silence existed and nothing else.\n\nEverything.\n\nEverywhere.\n\nThe whole world fell completely silent.\n\n“Hey Zach…,” Lauren uttered with a clear voice finally, breaking the silence. She raised her head and looked at him.\n\nHe turned to face her as well with obliviousness. It easily grabbed his attention as it had been quite a bit since he had heard her voice like that.\n\nThere was a bright smile drawn on her face; her signature smile at long last. However, the smile… didn’t quite fit with her lifeless eyes. It felt like a doll was looking at him.\n\nAnd so… he awaited her answer. “What’s up?”\n\n“Let’s jump off… just like the lighthouse!”\n\n「...」\n\nZachary froze; his smile petrified.\n\n「Huh…?!!」",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 23 - To Reality\n\nreality /rɪˈalɪti/\n\nthe state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them.\n\n“Let’s jump off… just like the lighthouse!” Lauren said.\n\nThe world stood still with the mention of those words.\n\nYet only one thing started to move… it was the rain; the vigorous, endless rain. With the cold it was carrying in each droplet, it hammered down on the ground at a leisure pace as it grew faster and more with time.\n\nBut it didn’t matter, not to Lauren, nor to Zachary. There was something else at hand that pulled them out entirely of the world.\n\nLauren’s smile never faded, it only widened more with each passing second. And her eyes were perfectly still, staring back at Zachary with gleefulness.\n\n“Heh, good one,” Zachary chuckled, “But I’d rather go to the lighthouse before jumping.”\n\nIt had been so long since he had been with Lauren that he had almost forgotten about her tendency to crack jokes. She often made jokes and teased him with them before. This couldn’t be any more different. Her sense of humor was always awful.\n\n「Yeah… that’s it…」\n\nAnd yet, her face was still with the same bright smile, stuck between happiness and emotionlessness, ultimately resulting in a facade of apathy and delusion.\n\nBefore Zachary could speak up again back to her, she turned her sight away from him and faced downward.\n\nIn a soft and toneless voice, she spoke, “I mean if you think about it, if we had drowned back then we wouldn’t be here. You wouldn’t have destroyed your legs. I wouldn’t be in this... ‘depressive episode.’ We would’ve floated across the ocean together.”\n\n「...」\n\n“It won’t be as romantic but why not jump now?”\n\nFinishing up her words, she widened her smile to a blood-piercing extent as she approached Zachary.\n\nHowever, feeling uncomfortable from her presence, he quickly backed away.\n\n“Lauren…,” his mind was jaded from this quick turn of events, “W-What’s wrong with you? This isn’t a joke!”\n\n“No, it’s not…” Her smile had finally disappeared, leaving behind only an emotionless and senile expression on her face, which was all the more terrifying, “We’ve had our share of jokes together but this isn’t one.”\n\n“Stop it…”\n\nLauren faced downward, “... You left me… for three weeks…,” her lips quivered, her grip tightened. A feeling of aggravation crawled all over her body, “Three. Whole. Weeks. Not a word. I was lost, Zach! I was confused and sad, and angry and bitter! You had your fill… and you left me…!”\n\nBefore long, tears were dropping down from her eyes, sharing a path with the rain. They were ever so lost just as she was.\n\nEven though her voice was barely loud enough to make it an argument, her sudden reaction felt like one, and Zachary knew that well. From the moment she showed up, there was something off about her. She seemed happy, and yet not. She seemed to be here, and yet she wasn’t. It was all very clear. He knew it well and it left him speechless once again.\n\nHe just lacked the answer to why.\n\n“...L-Lauren…,” he tried to comfort her.\n\nBut—\n\n“YOU LEFT ME!!!” She stood up and shouted at the top of her lungs, rejecting his aid, “YOU WEREN’T THERE WHEN I… when I…”\n\nLosing strength both in her voice and herself, her legs collapsed on the ground, leaving only her arms to support her.\n\n“Day in and day out…,” she still carried on, “...you never answered. You never got back to me. Even when I stopped going to school, you never asked about me.”\n\nZachary stood baffled at Lauren’s sore sight and wondered how quickly she had reached that state. While he was off to find himself a greater purpose that would leave him enlightened, she was left alone to trample in the mud and descend down a pit she could never recover from.\n\nShe wrapped her arms around her body as if she was embracing herself, and waggled from side to side, “I was all alone… No one listened to me.”\n\nIt was almost laughable how twisted their fates had become.\n\nZachary lied speechless once again. He didn’t know whether to grab Lauren and tie her up before doing anything maddening or simply comfort her.\n\nThis story originates from Royal Road. Ensure the author gets the support they deserve by reading it there.\n\nThe words she spouted were gut-wrenching as much as they were shocking. Her actions were all completely erratic, there was no way she was ever in a sane mind. This wasn’t Lauren.\n\nAngered by the silence, she slammed her fist to the ground, “No one listens to me…!”\n\n“W-Wait n-no,” he tried to salvage what he could, “I-I’m listening. I… I’m here.”\n\nAll of a sudden, the tears stopped and her voice faded. She sat there on the ground, staring at nothing, not even paying attention to Zachary who leisurely took his time to approach her.\n\nYet nothing happened.\n\nShe didn’t move or flinch for a second as if her body had gone completely petrified.\n\nBut then she looked at Zachary. Her face was as pale as the moon. Her eyes had all life removed from them. Her lips were deprived of any color.\n\nEverything about her had become entirely colorless.\n\n“...I’m tired…,” she said in an apathetic tone.\n\n“Alright,” Zachary approached her, he dreaded for anything unexpected to happen to her. Something was clearly off about her behavior, and if anything, this was the worst place she could be at in a state like this, “Then let’s get you back—”\n\n“NO!!”\n\nWith all her might, she pushed him away and stood up in a hysterical manner.\n\n「That hurt…」\n\nBefore he knew it, she was standing on top of the ledge.\n\nHer figure, against the giant shade of twilight, almost offered a picturesque scenery, but not a single thing to be admired about it remained or ever existed, to begin with. Both her hair and dress fluttered with the wind. Yet despite everything, with the shadows covering her face, extinguishing what light it had left, she still smiled.\n\nIt was at that moment that Zachary felt his heart completely cave in.\n\nHis mind wavered to horrible outcomes that he didn’t want to ever imagine come true. But anyone with a sane mind could easily determine what her actions were leading to, what her position and movements meant. This was never Lauren.\n\nThis was someone who completely shredded all sense of reasoning.\n\n“L-Lauren,” he took a deep breath before grabbing his feet to the ground, “What are you doing? Get down from there!!!”\n\n“I already told you, Zach,” a smile was drawn on her lifeless face.\n\nThis was someone who lost sight of their life.\n\n“I’m tired! You’re tired! I just want some rest.”\n\nThis was someone who could no longer grasp all life.\n\n“I want to leave! It’s so suffocating with everyone.” Her face lacked any emotion, yet she was smiling. “Everyone is just…” She crumbled her head to her torso, as if she suffered agony, before quickly returning back to form with that same dreadful smile, “They’ll take your world. They’ll take your mind. They’ll take your dream. They’ll take all you know. They’ll take your heart. They’ll take your life. They’ll even take your death. They’ll take everything from you and cut you down all for the catharsis of keeping you where they think you belong. To keep the ‘you’ they think you want. Nothing is ever yours. We were never allowed to truly live. Tell me, Zach. Isn’t that what you once thought? Isn’t that what you desire? Isn’t that what you taught me?”\n\n“I…,” Zachary felt his chest tighten.\n\n「What the hell is she talking about?」\n\nShe spread her arms at their respective ends, flailing them around as she tip-toed with joy across the ledge like a child playing hopscotch.\n\n“Tell me,” she spoke with a cheerful tone as she continued her little game, “How many times did the butterfly flutter?”\n\n“W-What… What?” He tried to keep in his stutter.\n\n“It fluttered once,” she took a step, “Above an ocean of lilies.”\n\nWith her arms still up in the air, balancing her weight, she took another reckless step.\n\nShe laughed, “It fluttered twice, within a blackthorn storm,” followed by another step, “It fluttered thrice, beyond the field of daffodils.”\n\n“Lauren, this isn’t like you!” Zachary stomped his foot on the ground.\n\n“Oh come on,” she halted her step before lending out her hand for him to grab, “You stop being a sourpuss and join me!”\n\n“N-No!” He instinctively uttered, “I’ll never do that!”\n\nFollowing his words, her smile faded as she put her hand away and turned to face the outside. “Fine then, I’ll just go on my own!”\n\n「No…」\n\nIt was a sight unbelievable to the eyes. She was going through with what she claimed she desired.\n\nAnd so, she raised her feet off the ledge—\n\n“L-Lauren!” Zachary screamed.\n\n「Just reverse it… reverse it all.」\n\nHe fell in panic. Not an idea came to mind on what he should, or whether he should do anything at all.\n\nBut that was when he realized… The step never happened.\n\nLauren was still standing on the ledge. It was no sick vision or a hallucination. She stood there with all of herself, living and breathing, but never to move or take a step, as if the entire world fell to a halt.\n\nThere was still a chance.\n\n“L-Lauren!!” He desperately called out to her.\n\nTo his surprise, she responded with a tilt of her head in his direction. Her eyes seemed different from before, there was still a glimmer of light within. But her face told a different story unlike anything before, she didn’t speak, but one could immediately tell how she fell completely oblivious to what was around her.\n\n“L-Lauren, please,” he struggled to maintain a straight voice from the fear clearly clouding his mind, “Come back… This… this isn’t a joke!”\n\nWanting to seize this opportunity, he stretched out his arms and carefully walked over to where she was. He was going to catch her. He must catch her.\n\n「No…」\n\nIt was then that he noticed the gradual shift in the expression on her face. There was sweat dripping from the side of her forehead. Her entire body seemed shaken.\n\nLauren was scared.\n\n“Z-Zach?!” She called out to him in a terrified voice. Her cold, emotionless tone from before seemed almost non-existent.\n\n“Yes, yes, it’s me,” he felt glad to see her call him in that manner.\n\nAll that happened prior to this “change” seemed to be but a mere dream to her as if she was asleep and now she had awoken. If that was the case, it would most likely explain the shift in personality. It was not something to be easily faked, and Zachary knew Lauren, she wasn’t capable of pulling such an act.\n\n“Now get away from there,” he said as he proceeded toward her.\n\n“What… What am I doing here? Why am I here?”\n\nWith the realization hitting her, she started to panic, and that never led to a good thing. She wanted to move her legs and jump back in but they wouldn’t move. She was quivering and felt petrified at the same time.\n\n“No, stay right there, I’ll come get you,” Zachary commanded. He could not have her move or do anything that might cause—\n\n“W-What do you mean by that?” She cried, moving her quivering, weak legs, “What’s going on here?”\n\n“I’ll tell you everything, just don’t move!”\n\n“Zach…,” she said, “H-Help me… please…”\n\nBut then…\n\n…the unexpected happened.\n\nThe wind faded and the rain halted — eternal desire.\n\nThe hearts wailed and the minds wavered — eternal cry.\n\nThe girl slipped and the dream slept — eternal sorrow.\n\nThe world stopped.\n\nAnd so came the end of Lauren Cherith.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Prelude 24 - The Real Ideal\n\nreal /riːl/\n\nactually existing as a thing or occurring in fact; not imagined or supposed.\n\nIt was just another evening.\n\nJust another inclement evening.\n\nAnother evening… without her.\n\nFor three harrowing days since that dreadful nightfall, the rain persisted, never to die out or to stop for even a second. As melodramatic as it was, the sorrows of others were not silent, for even in the loud rainfall of the world’s cries, they cried along with it. They all cried.\n\nOn that barren grass that almost turned to mud from the rain was a long, black coffin, descending down a hole of equal size. It adorned itself with an ornament of white flowers; lilies. Surrounding it were dozens of people coated in black, some held umbrellas to shield themselves from the rain, and then there were others that had no desire to even think.\n\nThis was a funeral — Lauren’s funeral.\n\n“This isn’t real…,” a girl mumbled from within the crowd, “It can’t be real… it just can’t…”\n\nA portion of the crowd were high school students, they were all Lauren’s classmates and friends. Even as time passed, most of them were still in denial, especially the girl, who happened to be Lauren’s best friend. She was devastated. But she, and her friends, were not the only ones. There were friends, family, and acquaintances alike. Every single one that Lauren’s smile was once laid upon stood there at the funeral.\n\nBut then there was Zachary Ashworth, neither weeping nor moving, remaining just an emotionless shell nestled in the ground under the rain. He stood at the front away from both crowds at the sides, for he desired not to face them, he despised all of them. If they truly cared for Lauren, then they would have been there for her when he wasn’t.\n\n「Where were you then…?」\n\nHe would think while shooting glances at his classmates from afar; the classmates that he resented so much from long ago.\n\nBefore long, the coffin was finally buried underneath the ground, harboring a lifeless shell that was never to surface again. A headstone nestled in the ground just near the burial, serving as a grim reminder of who rested below the earth.\n\nLAUREN CHERITH\n\n2005 - 2022\n\nThere was a woman on the ground.\n\nShe cried hysterically in front of the grave. Her eyes were sore from the endless stream of tears running down her cheeks, and her hair was a chaotic mess from being soiled in the dirt whenever she stomped her head to the ground.\n\n“You… you c-can’t leave me like that…!” The woman wailed as she embraced the headstone, “I know… I-I-I know I… I wasn’t a good mother… but I… I… always… I always… loved you…,” her weeping became louder, “I-I always loved you…!”\n\nIt was a sad sight to witness; sad in several different ways. Never did anyone imagine the woman who neglected her child for so long would be broken beyond measure in this state after her death. This was Lauren’s mother; the drunken disgrace of a mother that always brought shame to her child’s name.\n\nYet at this moment, she seemed to be none of that, she looked just like any parent mourning the loss of their child. It was no mere act. After all, she was still a mother, and she would continue to live her life as a regretful mother who only learned the sentiment of motherhood after all reason to be was lost.\n\n“I love you…,” cried the mother again.\n\nThis book was originally published on Royal Road. Check it out there for the real experience.\n\nShe seemed to be talking to her daughter from beyond the grave, truly marking the loss of sanity within her.\n\n“I love you. I love you. I love you so much, so please come back to me!!!” She clenched her fist and slammed it to the ground, “Lauren, sweetie, please…!!!!! Don’t waste your life like that. If-If you want me gone, I’ll leave and you’ll… you’ll never see me again and, and… and then you can come back. Sweetie, they are saying you’re dead. Can you believe it? You! My sweet little daughter! D-Dead?!”\n\nHearing her cries brought only more ache and sorrow to the people’s hearts.\n\n“Please wake up and tell them that you’re not. Get up here and show them that you’re alive. I know… I know you’re in there!”\n\nTo everyone’s shock, she dug her hand into the dirt and started digging to remove the dirt. A few men quickly rushed to grab her and pull her away, but she fought back against their attempts.\n\n“Leave me!!!” She screamed, “I just want to see… I want to see my baby!!! I know she’s down there listening!! She’ll suffocate if we don’t get her out!! You’re killing her!! I know she’s still there!!! Let me go, you murderers!”\n\nDespite her devastating pleas, the men still pulled her off ground and away from the grave. Another man, seemingly the father, took her by the arm as they both walked through the crowd and out of the gravesite.\n\n「Nothing’s changed…」\n\nZachary clenched his fist.\n\nEven after all that he went through; after all that she went through, he still wasn’t able to make the right decision. She was the star that lit up his colorless world, the one that pulled him out of the cave he locked himself in before, the one who, above all else, saved him. And yet, he didn’t save her.\n\n“So that’s the boy, eh…”\n\n“He saw it all and didn’t do a bloody thing? Fucking hell.”\n\nVoices; old, young; sad, angry. Many, many voices.\n\nThey echoed through the rain, all berating Zachary for his ineptitude and lack of strength to save the girl then.\n\n“Apparently, he just stood there. Can you believe that?” A woman whispered in a not-so-quiet manner, “The poor girl…”\n\nEveryone knew that he was the only one there at the time of her death, they knew he was the one who witnessed it all firsthand, and yet instead of offering comfort, they faced him with hate. Their denial persisted even within their own selves, choosing only to shift the blame on him.\n\n「What would you know?」\n\nIt was a time like this that he wished for the noise to cloud his ears once again. He couldn’t defend himself, and there was no one to defend him. There was always her to act in his place whenever things went south, protecting him no matter what.\n\nBut now, she was gone.\n\nHowever, not all was lost, for an unlikely party came to the front.\n\n“Will you all just shut the fuck up? This is a funeral for fuck's sake.”\n\nIt was the voice of someone he never expected to stand up for him, someone he barely talked with. It was his cousin.\n\n“Erina!” Her younger brother, his other cousin, whispered for her to quiet down.\n\nIn spite of her efforts, a young man broke out of the crowd where the students were. With a tight grip, he grabbed Zachary and pushed him to the ground, sulling the both of them in the dirt. But the young man didn’t care, the anguish that was written on his face made it clear his mind was too clouded with pain to care about anything at all.\n\n“You!” He swung his fist at Zachary, landing it in his face, “You let her die!”\n\nHowever, Zachary barely felt a thing from the impact. He had lost all sense of touch. The pain had no meaning anymore. Only the droplets of rain from above that touched his skin made him hold onto his life.\n\n“You could’ve called for help!!!” The young man punched him once again.\n\nStill nothing. Not even a hint of speech.\n\n“It’s all your goddamn fault!!”\n\n「Why are you blaming me?」\n\n“Yeong-Gi! That’s enough!!” A girl, the same girl who was crying earlier, called out and grabbed the young man’s arm, “Stop it!”\n\n「Why are you all blaming me? I didn’t do anything.」\n\nAs the young man got off him, he stayed on the ground, thinking about everything that was going on, or rather he desired not to think about anything at all. It was all too tiresome in his eyes.\n\nBefore he knew it, a man approached him, offering a hand to help him up. That man was none other than Lauren’s father.\n\nZachary was startled upon seeing him. Of all people, it was the man who most likely resented him the most that wanted to help him. For what reason, he couldn’t wrap his finger around it.\n\nNevertheless, he accepted his help and got off his feet.\n\n“You’re Zach… right?” The father exclaimed in a rather calm tone, “My… my daughter’s talked about you a lot… at least, she used to,” he lowered his head and sighed, “She had a whole song and dance about how great you were and how much you helped her.”\n\nAfter brushing off the dirt from his suit, he looked at him, “Sir, I…”\n\n“No need,” a mournful smile was drawn on his face.\n\nSeeing that smile startled Zachary for a moment, if not for how the father could still smile despite the dreadful situation, it was definitely because that smile reminded him of her.\n\n「Like father, Like daughter. That’s new!」\n\nThe father eyed the crowd for a moment before glancing back at Zachary with warmth. “Let’s talk elsewhere.”",

It made for a sick joke that neither of them conceived at that moment.\n\nDespite Lauren's father’s friendly, or rather solemn demeanor, Zachary felt his bones being shackled and his muscles tighten. The tension was far too great for his liking. It didn’t help that they hadn’t spoken a word since they departed from the crowd, it was only a measly five minutes, but to them, every minute was an hour.\n\nThen the father breathed out to speak.\n\n“You… you know,” he rested his arms on his knees and took a deep breath, “That competition a while ago… you were in it, right?”\n\nAs he tilted his head to his right, Zachary nodded quietly in response.\n\n“When they offered to publish her story… she declined,” he faintly chuckled and quickly covered his face to hold himself together, “She said it would “upset Zach,” that you started together and you needed to reach the finish line together, or something like that…”\n\nWith those last words, the father fell silent.\n\n“I…,” Zachary had nothing to say.\n\nTo be able to interact and discuss his recently deceased daughter proved to be an exhausting task, the man was at the end of his wits. As for Zachary, hearing what he had to say had earned him enough frustration to tighten his grip in silence. Both of them bared faces that urged them to scream and to stomp their feet into the soil on which they stood, and if they ever did that, they’d be no different than the mother who went looking for her daughter beneath the grave.\n\nBut what could they ever do? This was fate; the ever-so-odd red string of fate.\n\n“Lauren… she uh…,” the father opened up his mouth once again, “She was very, very fond of you. And I need to make sure that… you know that… none of this was your fault. That…,” he eyed him a look of both warmth and sorrow, “You’re a good kid, Zach. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, so… walk tall.”\n\n“Right…”\n\n“Um… that’s probably enough chit-chat for now,” he got off the bench.\n\nThe father might have maintained a sorrowful smile as a means to keep himself together but — Zachary could tell — he could not hide the pain in his eyes, which seemed swollen as if they were about to burst into tears again. He desired no longer any mention of his daughter for the time being so as to not mourn her any longer than he should, for he too believed he had to stand on his own two feet, for the sake of his now deluded wife.\n\n“Yes yes. It’s truly a heart-breaking matter.”\n\nA voice, a third party, interrupted with youthful enthusiasm.\n\nThere was a man standing near the father, gazing at the crowd and funeral from where he stood. Despite donning a black suit appropriate for a funeral and a fedora hat of equal color, he still stood out like a sore thumb. Furthermore, he had his neck wrapped by a dark green scarf riddled with inscriptions of an unknown kind. His unkempt long brown hair and crimson eyes told nothing good, and yet one could not help but be entranced by them.\n\nWho this man was and why he was here, none had an answer. And no one had the heart to speak up.\n\n“A soul ever-so-lost in the rain. Oh?” He turned his indifferent gaze to the father in surprise, “Oh my. Pardon me, it was a… how do you say it? Slip of the tongue?”\n\n“And… you are?” The father was dumbfounded.\n\n“Oh yes,” the man opened up his palm for a handshake but after seeing no response from the father, he turned his hand away and slightly bowed, “Charles Orwell, at your most esteemed service! I’m with the watchmen.”\n\n“Watchmen?!” The father widened his eyes, “Here? W-Why? What happened?”\n\nLove this story? Find the genuine version on the author's preferred platform and support their work!\n\n“Oh please remain calm, it’s nothing too serious,” the man coughed before he turned his gaze to Zachary, “I heard a rumor, that’s all. I’m here for the lad.”\n\nZachary did not flinch, opting to merely stare back at the man in solemness.\n\n“Now listen here,” the father seemed angry, “He did not—”\n\n“I am just here to do my job. I’ll simply ask some basic questions. You know, basic protocol and all that,” the man interrupted. “Can’t hurt now, can it?”\n\nYet the father didn’t want to move away. Like anyone with a sane mind in this town, he didn’t share a single bit of trust with the watchmen or any of the military police for that fact.\n\n“By the way,” the man smiled and placed his hands in his pockets, “They say there was once a man who stuck his nose into every trifling matter that didn’t concern him and let’s just say, for the sake of our dear friend here, it didn’t end well for him.”\n\nIn the face of the man’s harrowing smile and words, the father could do nothing but step away. Following that abrupt farewell, he set off to join the crowd, leaving Zachary with the man alone.\n\nWith one matter done, the man moved onto the next. He swiftly walked over to the bench and sat beside Zachary. His bright smile was still present on his face.\n\n“What a sour sight for the eyes, almost felt bad for him.” The man let out a deep sigh before he placed his hands on Zachary’s shoulder.\n\n“Charles Orwell, huh,” Zachary brushed the man’s hand off his shoulder, “Quite the performance.”\n\n“Yes, yes. I’ve grown fond of it,” the man, Orwell, tilted his head to both sides to relax his muscles, “It’s been well over a month now. You cannot expect me to wander about stuck to a tree. Though these clothes shackle me, I, too, need some liberty — I’m not a genie in a bottle, after all. Besides, you’re the one with the impressive array of skills, pisspot. I think you’ve had me beat.”\n\n“Yeah…,” he sighed.\n\n“But in all honesty, if this is bothering you, don’t let it get to you.” Orwell nudged him a bit to ease whatever tension might have persisted.\n\n“I know…”\n\nHe knew very well. There was nothing to be done. It was a fact that he could not reject, only embrace.\n\n“I can still taste it.”\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“Zach…,” she said, “H-Help me… please…”\n\nLauren Cherith, who was standing on the ledge of the rooftop, who was ready to commit herself to death, was now grasping for dear life as if she had awoken from a terrible dream to a terrifying nightmare. As her legs were slowly giving in to the numbness, her cries and pleas echoed over the rain.\n\nZachary Ashworth stood facing her at the rooftop, drowning in a cold sweat. He was ready to jump off his feet at any moment.\n\nAnd then…\n\n…the expected happened.\n\nThe wind faded and the rain halted.\n\nThe hearts wailed and the minds wavered.\n\nThe girl slipped and the dream slept.\n\nThe world stopped.\n\nBut Lauren Cherith was still in life’s grasp.\n\nWhen she came to, she was still on the ledge, just a step away from demise, yet her whole body was left in Zachary’s embrace. He had caught onto her at the last moment, never to let her go. Even as he stood on the ledge with her in his grasp, his overwhelming strength was in clear contrast to her own diminishing strength.\n\nImmediately, she wrapped her arms around him and continued her cries.\n\n“I…,” she faintly spoke, “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”\n\nHer breath was still warm. Her heart was still beating. Her eyes were still lit. But her smile was nowhere to be found; that smile befitting an evershine star was lost.\n\nFor a moment she felt that warmth she had long desired. A glimmer of what she had lost was found buried deep in Zachary’s chest.\n\n“I… I want to go back… to when I was helping you. Is that selfish? Is that wrong?”\n\nZachary’s grip tightened.\n\nIt was almost suffocating. Within the suffocation, Lauren found comfort and understanding. As she was drowning herself in the warmth she couldn’t help but forget where she was.\n\n“When we go back… can you stay with me?” Her voice let out a faint wail, “O-Or maybe I can stay with you. Just for a day or two.”\n\nShe felt his grip loosen and his hand touch her chin. The warmth never left but now he was looking down on her, his eyes warmer than ever.\n\nTheir lips met. Their souls embraced.\n\nHis grip loosened.\n\nHer mind had drifted long ago. Her legs were numb.\n\nHe smiled. He let go\n\nLauren’s eyes remained as soft as ever.\n\nHer legs gave way. Their lips broke their bond. She felt no more pain. No more helplessness. As the gravity carried her to her resting place, she remained entranced. Their eyes never left each other until the final moment of departure.\n\nHer smile only faded moments before the final stop.\n\nThe wind howled and the rain marched.\n\nThe hearts whispered and the minds advanced.\n\nThe boy left and the dream awoke.\n\nThe world resumed.\n\nAnd so came the end of Lauren Cherith.\n\nTo do the right thing is to be virtuous and compassionate but it is also to be inhumane. It is the thin facade humanity wears to hide its true desire. For if there is peace, there are talks of a bright future. But if there is an opportunity for glory behind cowardice, that facade is ripped apart by the uncontrollable grin of chaos.\n\nThat is the true nature of humanity.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Interlude - The Oldest Book\n\nbook /bʊk/\n\na written or printed work consisting of pages glued or sewn together along one side and bound in covers.\n\nAnother week passed and news of Lauren Cherith’s suicide made it to the mouths and ears of the townspeople, branching into more rumours and gossip over the true matter. However, this time, the rumours remained as they were, just rumours, never to reach the hand of the myth and legend who granted wishes, for his hand dealt a greater deal. The Hanged Man had been freed from his vines — and with him, the enigmatic boy known as Zachary Ashworth.\n\nThe writing, the fantasy, the magic, and even Neverland, it was all true.\n\nThe Hanged Man, despite being mythical and powerful, did not possess the freedom he always wished for due to being tied by his form. It was the irony of his existence, and so with his newfound contract that required his presence beside his master at almost all times, he took the human facade of one ‘Charles Orwell’ who claimed to be an inspector investigating cases here and there — an elaborate excuse to roam about as he pleased without suspicion.\n\nAs for Zachary Ashworth, he was happy. He was finally able to crush the shackles that bound him.\n\n“You’d make Lucifer shiver in fear,” the Hanged Man, now going by Charles Orwell or simply Orwell, told him once.\n\nAnd indeed there was nothing to disprove that statement. It was he who agreed to the Hanged Man’s contract that night in the hospital and, not shortly after, orchestrated the “wish” that would end the watchmen’s lives and start a new string of paranormal rumours.\n\nZachary just provided the people with what they really love: Stories.\n\nWith a pen and book in his hand ready to write, his wishes had become the Hanged Man’s own to command. His disappearance, his return, and even the girl’s mental degradation leading to her suicide were all part of his grand scenario.\n\nZachary Ashworth had become an author. But still, there were many great things ahead of him; mysteries that he had yet to explore.\n\nFor now, a bright-coloured world approached the horizon.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“The Oldest Book, you say?” Zachary asked.\n\nShortly after the contract had been fulfilled and with the boy now indulging himself within the matters of the so-called fantasy, Orwell told Zachary of a mystical book; a long-lost book that spoke of the secrets of the world. Of course, it sounded pretty much as every made-up legend would, but unlike anyone with a sane mind, Zachary listened intently. He believed there was something there, after all, with a tree-like creature that could shapeshift itself into a human at his side, an all-powerful book of knowledge would not be so far-fetched.\n\n“Yes yes, it’s the oldest book there is, from before even the time of our old friend Gilgamesh. Many, authors especially, embarked on quests hoping to acquire the knowledge of all beginning but none ever came close to a glimpse of victory.” Orwell said, “I dare not look for it as I am what I am, but you, my dear author of both worlds, I believe you can find it.”\n\n“Why should I ever care about that?” Zachary asked. His words might have signalled disinterest but truth to be told, he was inclined on learning more of the book but an inkling spoke of Orwell hiding something for him. Even with a contract binding his soul to his, he was still clouded with a glimmer of doubt and pessimism. “What’s in it for me?”\n\n“Everything,” said Orwell.\n\nAnd so, they searched.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\n“I may not hold the full knowledge of its history, but I know enough to desire it as much as everyone else,” Orwell smiled, “And you should be the same. My dear author.”\n\nTheir search had brought them within the walls of the mansion that belonged to Zachary’s family. Its vast collection meant the oldest book could’ve been hiding in plain sight all along. After all, it held value only in the eyes of those who knew its truth, the authors, so to the average person, none would bat an eye if it ever crossed their path.\n\nAnd in their endless search, they came across a particular path in the mansion. It appeared rather battered, untouched even, the cobwebs grew as the spiders took shelter and roamed about as they pleased.\n\nSeeing that hallway puzzled not only Orwell but Zachary himself as well, for how it remained in such a sorry state with dozens of maids running about in the mansion was something neither of them knew. However, what they knew for a fact was that something of an unruly nature lurked deep within. It was at moments like these that Zachary would take a step back and leave, never to turn his back around to it for he desired to be left in peace. But now, his desire was much aligned with Orwell’s, and if anything were to erupt, he had his trusty book in his grasp.\n\nUnlike most authors, as Orwell would claim, Zachary was what would the people of Neverland would consider a “halfmibet,” one that possessed the innate skills for Authority but not fully, in short, he was half-blood: a human, and whatever transcendent humans those authors were. It was quite a baffling revelation in Zachary’s mind but he kept his reaction to a minimum. Rather than praise God for descending upon him this grand twist of fate in his favour, he quietly embraced what he had in hand.\n\nIf you stumble upon this narrative on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen from Royal Road. Please report it.\n\nNow, being a halfmibet meant he could not perform his writing however he pleased and that was why he was tied to the pen and paper. Though at first glance it might seem as if he’s simply itching random words and scribbles all over the paper, those words were of a magical nature, they were the very same words he used his commands with, for his skills were nothing more than that of a low novice’s.\n\nHis connection with Orwell was all he had for power.\n\n「All of it…」\n\nWith nothing to hinder his path, he pushed the door to the only room he could find in the place. A loud creak emitted from the door as it heavily scratched against the floor to open. It was painfully prevalent how dilapidated this place had become.\n\nClosely shuttered and damp, the room was unfamiliar. Only a small line of that afternoon light seeped in from under the curtains, enough to bring the dust particles into sight, offering a strangely captivating scene. As their eyes slowly adapted to the dark, they began to see the room a bit clearer than before. The first thing to notice in that room was the giant shelf of books in the centre.\n\nIt was bizarre for a room like this all the way on the other side of the mansion, let alone be closed off for who knew how long considering all the dust it had gathered over time. Zachary has never wandered this far into the mansion before. He had always stuck to just the right side of the mansion where his room was.\n\nThere was no doubt this was the old library of the mansion in the past. But why it remained with its antiquities, they hadn’t the faintest idea.\n\nNot too far from the shuttered windows on the right was what looked like a 19th century piano, seemingly too old to the extent that its age was starting to show, even in this dimly lit room.\n\nZachary wiped a bit of dust off with his finger. He doubted it still worked. And just as he thought, no matter how many times or how hard he pressed the keys, there was just no response. Lifting off the cover for more inspection, he noticed most of the hammers were either missing or completely broken.\n\nHowever, that wasn’t the only thing inside.\n\nThere was a small note on top of the soundboard. It looked torn and barely held itself together as Zachary held it in his hand.\n\n“Piano’s not working anymore due to Gaston’s antics last night.\n\nTold him a thousand times not to write here but he never learns.\n\nI am sure it is unfortunate for you, dear.\n\nPerhaps you can call that girl you and your sister always talk with to fix it. She might be a child, but I heard she knew plenty about the piano from Aphra. I am quite confident she would be up to the task. Her mother was a songstress, after all.\n\nDo update me once you find a solution.\n\n- Mother Teresa”\n\nThe writer’s name did not ring any bells; he could only narrow his eyes in wonderment. He knew the names of everyone here in the house, yet none of the names in this note clicked with him.\n\nBarely anyone wrote notes in this day and age. There was a possibility this could have belonged to one of his ancestors. Knowing that the piano never got fixed somehow brought a feeling of sorrow. The old residents of the mansion, his ancestors most likely, must have had quite the colourful life considering they had time to think of such luxuries, unlike the present family, where all they knew was drinking tea and keeping to themselves despite their failure of an attempt to connect with each other.\n\nFor a moment he thought of his mother on the balcony that one time and shivered at the memory of her face again. He shook his head to forget.\n\nHe started to wonder.\n\nIf this “Mother Teresa” really wanted someone to read this note, perhaps she could have thought twice before placing it inside the piano where not the naked eye could simply see.\n\nSomething seemed odd… felt odd.\n\nHe tilted his head toward the direction of the windows.\n\nThere was nothing there.\n\nHe felt he had seen something in the corner of his eyes: a black mass or figure just standing there beside the window. But there could never be something of the sort. Reading too many books might have gotten to his head and imagination. His mind was most likely playing tricks with him for being in a dark abandoned room — which would be a clear, reoccurring scenario for horror scenes in books.\n\n“So this is the famed Nightingale’s library, I presume?” Orwell said. He followed around Zachary at the front, eying whatever small monument caught his attention like a child wandering into a museum. Though his manner and actions spoke to that of a simple man, his words took another turn entirely. “Truly astonishing how this is where good ol’ Rohan kicked the bucket. He was a good fellow, I knew of him back in the day but we never crossed paths even in this form of mine.”\n\n“What are you talking about?” Zachary sneered.\n\n“Why! Would look at that,” Orwell let out a chuckle, “The boy doesn’t know of his own heritage. I’m speaking of none other than Rohan Nightingale, the very first patriarch of your very own family. An old “undying” miscreant, he was told to be, living till the age of just Eleventy-One. Surely you didn’t think you had the potential to be enlightened by pure chance. You are special, my dear author, in more ways than one, you are special.”\n\nOrwell thoroughly spoke of Zachary’s family, and it only left him wide-eyed and slightly amused at how a mythical creature knew far better of his family than he ever did.\n\nStill, his doubtful gaze never escaped Orwell’s. “If you expect me to believe your fairy tale nonsense then you might need to be re-educated.”\n\n“Oh, you and I both know that I spoke of no rubbish, Zacharus of the Ashworth kin,” Orwell spoke nonchalantly, “Son of the slothful Fredwick Ashworth and Emilia Nightingale, second cousin to the lustrous Aurora Nightingale, grandson of the prideful Steppen Nightingale, and great-great-grandson to the ravenous Rohan Nightingale. I could list the whole tree and beyond if you so pleased. It was not a charade when I spoke of your speciality, your talent for Authority is one thing, but your heritage is another.”\n\n“Of course,” he said in a solemn tone. As much as he wanted to believe, there were still doubts in his mind, even when matters had taken a rather bizarre turn. In truth, he was much more interested in how Orwell spoke of his ancestors than his ancestors themselves. “And those titles. Ravenous. Slothful. Do they also have some mystical meaning?”\n\n“Why, these belong to no other than the Royals, of course.”\n\n“The Royals?” He raised an eyebrow.\n\n“Yes yes,” Orwell said. He rested his hands on Zachary’s shoulders and turned him in the direction of a wall.\n\nOn that wall were three paintings grouped beside each other, one was that of two sisters (one standing with a prideful gaze and the other sitting on a chair with a blindfold), the second painting was all but a frame as the entire picture was torn out, but the third one was the one that caught the most attention from the two onlookers. It depicted a man, carrying a nicely-shaped moustache on his face, sitting on a rather grand chair with an elegant pose and a striking gaze, and behind him were six men and women standing together, bearing the same murderous gaze as the man’s. That painting was nothing more than an illustration of a band of crooks rather than a family.\n\nThe Hanged Man smiled, “The Royals of Vice!”",

For almost an entire week, he had spent his time in the car on the road ahead to his destination, stopping occasionally at gas stops, rests, and motels where he could spend the night — he would be fine with a night in the car, but his back problems won’t. It wasn’t until the day before his arrival, that Flynn decided to skip a motel — he couldn’t find one anyway — leaving himself in a desperate desire for sleep.\n\nWatching nothing but a constant scene of trees and only one road would doze one off. Flynn struggled to keep his eyes open, to keep himself from accidentally drifting off the road, even with the radio screaming out loud with the joyful tone of Katrina Leskanich singing her famous “Walking On Sunshine.” He would often think that night of the idea of parking somewhere and taking a quick nap, but it was too risky to stop in the middle of nowhere where God knows what could happen.\n\n「Never thought I’d see the day I would get tired of you.」\n\nThe sun shone earlier than usual, permanently stopping Flynn from flaking out. The scene of trees played the same, but now Flynn’s eyes were wide awake, filled with excitement. He was starting to see the mountains and radio towers from afar, which were two specific landmarks that the town he was heading to was known for. Not another second, a sign, welcoming whoever passed it, perched beamingly, stating that the passer was only a mile away from 「MELANVALE」. Seeing that sign only splattered a hogshead of relief at Flynn, he wanted to squeal with joy but stopped himself in a split second when he remembered he was a thirty-seven year old man with dignity — he wouldn’t want to make a bad impression on the townsfolk.\n\nA car emerged in the distance, and Flynn thought of seeking its help for gas, but his car was still working fine — two days have passed since he stopped by a gas station. Settling on the thought or not, seeking their help was just wishful thinking, as the car seemed to be in a hurry that it passed by him in a shot, followed by smoke.\n\nHe coughed and quickly rolled up the windows.\n\n“Way to leave an impression, huh.”\n\nFinally passing the mile stated in the sign earlier, Flynn was soon faced by the town proper. There were three lanes in front of him, one for the citizens, one for visitors, and one for workers, followed by a giant gate at the end for what would be presumed as the entrance to the town. However, that wasn’t the only thing of notice on the road ahead. A security booth lied by the gate, followed by what looked like soldiers, rather than average security, positioned at every point at every lane. It was as if he was driving into a military camp.\n\n「Guess they never recovered, huh.」\n\nMost of the soldiers donned similar uniforms to each other: the dirt green cotton jackets decorated with the dark yellow pads on their shoulders that showed their ranks, and the long pants of matching color with the ridiculous boots at their feet. Only difference from one soldier to another was the insignias a few had and a few didn’t — and the darker shade others would have on their coats from the rest.\n\nHe passed the soldiers while driving through one of the lanes, not batting them an eye, yet he could feel their cold stares following him. Reaching the front entrance near the booth, a soldier, who seemed to have been a higher rank than those around him due to how he dressed differently, knocked on the window. Flynn turned down the radio, before rolling down the windows and giving the officer a smile.\n\n“License.” The officer demanded, stretching out his palm in front of the window. The peaked cap on his head, as opposed to the garrison cap all the other soldiers had, barely made his eyes visible, which equally fed into the menacing air surrounding him.\n\n“Oh, I’m not here for a visit.” Flynn said, maintaining a casual tone in his voice.\n\n“Then why’d you pass through the visitor’s lane?”\n\n“Hey, cut a guy some slack,” He put his arm out the window and pointed at the lanes in the back. “I didn't know which lane to go through. Also, you guys don’t exactly have an option here for newcomers so…”\n\n“Are you now?” The officer tilted his hat upwards and gave him a look of suspicion. They needed to be sure of who came and who went, and if they were friendly or not. All the process for military land, rather than a rural town.\n\n“Am I what?” Flynn was confused. “You think I’m—”\n\n“No, I know you are not,” the officer tried to straighten his point, “You certainly don’t speak like one. But…” He leaned down to inch his face closer to the window, “And I’m speaking on behalf of my fellow comrades— we don’t exactly take kindly to strangers, especially the foreign kind. I may let you go, but they, in there, will spot you from a mile away. And unless they got orders to halt their actions… they will not stop.” His words had turned from a warning to that of a threat, “If you’re not a foreigner, then you’re certainly not a farmer.”\n\n“(A couple o’ years out in the world and they start calling you a foreigner.) Damn, these people.” He mumbled under his breath.\n\nFlynn knew very well these were just normal procedures for something like this — he had been once in their place — but he couldn’t recollect ever being so stiff in thinking as them. It was as if they all followed orders without question. Yes, following orders was doing things right, but it wasn’t always the right thing. Perhaps that was why Flynn hadn’t lasted long in the military.\n\n“Show me your documents and identification card, please.” The officer said.\n\n“Thought these kinda things would usually happen after I’m in.” Despite being clearly irritated by the officer before him at this point, Flynn tried to keep his frustration to a minimum and to insert a bit of life into this dull conversation. “Going through these procedures in the car is not so fun, ya’know.”\n\n“Well, we can’t be too hasty with everything going now, can we?”\n\nThe officer had a point. It hasn’t been that long since the war ended, but that only left the world back in the era of espionage and traitors. Every country, every town, tried to preserve what it had left and shunned out what it deemed wrong. Trust was something hard to come by, especially in this country’s military. A friend of Flynn’s would often tell him that it all reminded him of the awful times of distrust in the cold war, despite not directly experiencing it. But he didn’t want to bother himself with such matters anymore. It was particularly for that reason that he decided to seclude himself to this town.\n\nKeeping his mouth shut, he reached for the carbon box in the passenger seat and handed the officer the documents that were inside, alongside his card from his wallet.\n\nThe officer took them in silence and proceeded to read what was inside. “Inspector Flynn Locke…” The documents weren’t just the lease for his place of living in that town, but it also included his career history. “Your reputation precedes you. Joined the 107th brigade at the age of twenty-three. Left at the age of twenty-five. Opened up a paranormal investigation firm at the age of twenty-six?”\n\nThat last comment raised a few eyebrows around the soldiers, and the officer himself as well.\n\nFlynn was not so surprised by it, but he decided to laugh it off. “Just a private investigation firm. Nothing more, nothing less. Besides, I have to put food on the table somehow, correct?”\n\n“Right… Another lunatic. Just what we need.”\n\nThe officer backed away a bit from the car, eying the other soldiers around before looking down again on the papers he held. There was a certain tension in the air that could not leave Flynn’s presence. This was supposed to be just a normal pass through a town. It was a time of war, yes, but all these procedures should have been held later nonetheless — it wasn’t like security loosened up on the inside — yet it all took place right then and there — as if his paranoia was telling him he wouldn’t last long in there that he couldn’t even enter the town. He felt the need to grip onto his steering wheel to be ready to pull back at full throttle, even though these were nothing but delusional thoughts.\n\nStolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\n\nHe took a good look at the officer before him. The attire was certainly different from those around him, and yet, he seemed younger than anyone else there. The difference wasn’t huge but he seemed to emanate an aura of innocence and naivete despite his hardened expression.\n\nThis only brought about the question about how desperate this country was for soldiers. Flynn thought it was way past the times of war, but here they were, once again at a time no different than that of the first great war.\n\n“What regiment were you from?” Being a former soldier himself, he asked the officer with a smile.\n\nBut the officer wouldn’t tear down the wall he built. He handed Flynn a piece of paper that looked pretty much like a contract. “Please sign here.”\n\n“You really intend to keep it all at the door, huh.” Flynn followed their instructions with ease before he realized that the pen he held in his hand was no good for this normal situation. “Ah, wrong pen. You know, I keep a pen for this, a pen for that.” He put back the pen in his bag and brought out another that looked significantly different and less elegant, “Gotta maintain that professionalism, if you know what I mean.” He chuckled.\n\nBut the officer still had a stone cold expression.\n\nWhen Flynn brought out his bag to look for a pen, it came to the officer’s attention that he had a box of books beside him on the passenger’s seat, most likely ones that surrounded his field of work. But even then—\n\n“Got any books with you?” The officer said.\n\n“Books? Uh…” Flynn looked at the box before looking back at the officer and handing him the contract he signed off. “Yeah? They’re mostly for work but—”\n\n“Pass them to the inspection office to the left after you go through — it’s a red building, you can’t miss it. We don’t want to keep a man of your prestige held back any longer around here.”\n\nIt was a bizarre request but he passed it off as nothing but just another procedure of theirs. Like the officer said, he didn’t want to be kept around here any longer than he should.\n\n“Hey, lighten up, will ya?” He smiled at the officer. A veteran trying to give a novice a word of advice. “You’ve only got one life, and you’re gonna waste it if you spend it carelessly following orders like that.”\n\nThe officer did not flinch.\n\nHaving gotten used to that, Flynn chuckled before turning on his car key and finally set off to the gates of the town.\n\nIt was just when the gate opened that he remembered. “Oh yeah, before I forget,” He looked out the window and back at the officer from afar. “There a uh… Eveline High School around here?”\n\n“Everille, yes.” He responded, surprising as it might be. “Just follow the tram lines on the main street and you’ll find it near the end.”\n\n「Gosh, I gotta remember that name.」\n\n“That far, eh? Well, thanks for the info.”\n\nPast the hard part and with the information he wanted, Flynn Locke finally entered the infamous town of Melanvale, preparing himself for the next step he should take on this day that was most likely going to be his longest yet.\n\n△▼△▼△▼△▼△\n\nEverille High School was nothing much on the outside. It certainly was archaic in its type of structure and resembled a mansion of old rather than a modern-day high school, but that didn’t stop it from using that exact thing as a selling point — a private school had to earn its living no matter what after all. Thankfully it was a competent enough school to earn the trust of many without needing to rely too much on appearances.\n\nWith all of this information; Flynn was able to deduce in the few minutes he stood outside the school. The parking lot on the side was swarming with school buses despite the size of the town. And the sidewalk he parked beside was filled with several other cars. It was likely parents waiting for their children to come outside, perfectly-timed for Flynn to blend in as a ‘parent’ as well without being questioned much. From the look of the security outside, they didn’t seem to know much about their surroundings or who was who. They were doing their job down to the minimum, not because they were incompetent. They were simply new to the job; so new to the job that this was their first day.\n\nOf course, this wasn’t something that Flynn was able to come up with out of nowhere. After all, he was able to gather around a bunch of information as he was driving there that answered most of his questions now. Why was the school day ending around noon? Why were there so many parents waiting to pick up their kids when they could walk back home in such a small town. Why did the security change conveniently on the day of his arrival.\n\nA girl had passed away on school grounds just the past week, and the school quickly took procedures to secure its reputation. There were so many rumors surrounding it after the incident. Some were saying the girl was killed by school staff. Others were confirming the school’s hauntings through the girl’s death.\n\nIt was all useless chatter that only tainted the girl’s memory.\n\nBut this was the norm, it could not be changed. This town was infamous for exactly that: rumors and fairy tales circling around each citizen’s mouth that it would only take a bit to come true. A perfect host for fabled anomalies. It would have been disappointing to Flynn if that wasn’t the case, it was the whole reason for why he was there. Yes, he was going to establish his own office, but only for a short while before vanishing from everyone’s memory after solving their problems. That was a skill only an author could achieve.\n\nFlynn looked at his watch one last time. A few seconds and those gates would burst open with teenagers walking out in silence.\n\nFollowing the incident, the town itself decided to establish a curfew, especially for the youth, and forced every school there to follow its example as means to protect the children. That was why school ended so early.\n\nIt was an odd decision to still keep the school around considering the students would pretty much take a class or two before time was up. If anything, it would have been better to take an indefinite vacation until this matter was resolved. Shortening their time in a day wasn’t going to remove the risks. Flynn thought it was ridiculous.\n\n「And here we go…」\n\nThe bell rang, louder than that of one heard at church (showing just how quiet the town was), and the gates opened. Instead of children running out and screaming in joy, Flynn was met with teenagers walking out with barely an ounce of energy left in them. He knew his fantasies of seeing joy on a kid’s face was long gone in this era. Even if they were teenagers, there would have been at least a breath of life within them, especially when they barely had school to begin with.\n\nBut how could they? Their top student and friend was gone. It was too soon to return back to normal, and even then, there was a guarantee they were ever going to recover.\n\nHarsh as it may be, this was perfect for Flynn. With everyone locked in their own world and grief, he could easily single out the odd ones in the crowd and get to the person he wanted. No matter how hard grief could hit someone, it could never change the air surrounding them if they were odd— or in this case, gifted. He had an idea of what they looked like, but even for an observant man like him, something like this could accidentally be swept right under him.\n\nJust as he started looking, the target came right in the center of his line of sight. It was a young girl with short blonde hair. Her hostile expression could not help either. She very well looked like someone who was ready to “square up” with anyone who dared simply to look at her. Her height was above average for a girl her age, but short enough for Flynn to call her a kid with ease — although he could already tell she wasn’t going to make that easy.\n\nWith everything about her appearance, she looked normal when compared to the teenagers around here. But Flynn was able to tell her apart from everyone else. It was her eyes; her violet eyes that stood out with beauty among the rest, the eyes only found in the Nightingale bloodline.\n\nThe weather wasn’t chilly, yet that didn’t stop her from wearing the thickest jacket she could find underneath her school shirt, coupled with a typical skirt and shoes. Other than the jacket, there was one thing that stood out in her appearance, and in a not-so-good manner. Both her hands (up to her fingers) and legs were covered in bandages. If her hostile expression said anything, it was that she was likely to do the beating.\n\nNot one for sitting around once he had found his target, Flynn decided to approach the young girl. She wasn’t going to approach him of her own accord as she wouldn’t recognize him after all — besides the headphones blasting music she had on her ears.\n\nFlynn brought the girl to a halt while the rest of the crowd flowed like a stream. She was aware of her surroundings enough to not bump into him.\n\nFor a man about to hit his middle-aged phase, he barely had any experience with children — just about enough for one child he took care of almost his entire life.\n\n“Erina Nightingale?” He cleared his throat.\n\nOne glance from her deadly gaze was enough to make him flinch back, and yet the girl seemed to lack directy hostility, rather she was puzzled. She quickly took off her headphones, “And who the hell are you?”\n\n“Flynn Locke,” he said, clearing his throat once again. He couldn’t believe a mere girl like her had him intimidated despite barely doing anything of her own, “I knew your parents back in the day.”\n\nStill, the girl was as puzzled as ever, responding only with a tilt from her head.\n\nHe sighed, “You’ll be working for me till the Selection Trial?”\n\nUpon hearing his last words, the girl’s ears flinched and her eyes immediately lit up with surprise, “Oh,” she said. “Ohhhhhhhhh,” she realized. “Wait,” she backed away, her face coated with both astonishment and amazement. The thoughts spiraling in her mind couldn’t help her from containing her excitement, “YOU’RE THE GUY FROM NEVERLAND?!!”\n\nAlarmed by her loud reaction, Flynn rushed to shut her up, “Shhh shhh shhh, keep it down!” He whispered. He did not come all the way to this town only for a girl like her to put his hard work for naught by the slip of a tongue.\n\n“What?” The girl gave him a baffled look as she backed away from his grasp, “No one knows what that is in this dead town. It’s not like I went up to them and was like: Hey, I can write magical words with this magica—”\n\n“Okay okay, point taken. I get it.” He deeply exhaled, “Now, shut it!”\n\n“Eh, fine,” she scoffed.\n\n「And here I thought everything would go smoothly.」\n\nIf there was one thing evident about this girl, she was going to be quite the problem to deal with, and even more troublesome whenever she opened up her mouth. Flynn had taken a look at her file before arriving here, it spoke of her aggressive behavior and tendency to spout insults or “trash talk” whenever she got angry, which seemed to occur a lot. She might not look like it at first glance but it was clear she had quite the temper.\n\n“So where are we going?” She called out to him.\n\nHowever, she was nowhere near his sight. Before he had realized it, she was already standing near the car, leaning on the door as she awaited for him to join her. She was quick in understanding — and for all the wrong reasons.\n\n“Hey gramps, are we gonna get some food or not?” She shouted and waved around her hand erratically, “You must be hungry, coming from a trip like that. I know some great spots, ya know!”\n\nIt did not occur to Flynn that the girl had been thrown into his care without notice. He had found himself already assuming the role of a babysitter caring for a child rather than an inspector looking for a partner or an assistant.\n\n「What did I get myself into?」",

            "content": "Arc 0: Chapter 2 - When The Tiger Yearns For Hunger\n\nprotagonist /prəˈtaɡ(ə)nɪst/\n\nthe leading character of a drama or other literary work; one who moves the story forward.\n\nErina Nightingale was bad-tempered.\n\n“I’m deeply sorry, ma’am, but we’re really out of it.”\n\nDue to the curfew extension that was announced a couple of days prior and the mass panic that filled the citizens’ mind, the people swarmed the streets like ants earlier that week to “supply” themselves with the “necessary” provisions for them to be able to survive the curfew, and that included of course, everything that had to do with eating. From just simple groceries to literal months worth of stocks of just snacks (per person), they devoured everything.\n\nNaturally, most markets in the town found themselves suffering a sudden shortage. Although each store was compensated nicely in place of everything that was gone, who knew how long this curfew would go before it would turn into a lockdown?\n\nIt was all exaggeratedly ridiculous to say the least.\n\nAnd as one might expect, even the smallest and quietest convenience store in the town was no exception. Nothing escaped the mad hunger of fear.\n\nWith that in mind, the manager still expected a lot of complaints from customers directed at the store as they barely had any ample stock before they were entirely emptied. Nevertheless, the employees were well-mannered and well-trained to handle customers.\n\nBut even then, nothing was enough to prepare them for the storm that was approaching that day. It alone could render the entire population’s debacle as simple child’s play.\n\nBecause when Erina Nightingale desired something sweet, she was going to get something sweet no matter what.\n\nHer arms crossed, pristine position, and with a menacing glare, she towered over the employee who stood behind the counter.\n\nThe employee looked just about as tired from everything as everyone else was in this town... until she showed up and gave him the scare of his life. Yet, there was a certain charm to her face that he could not discern. Something about an athletic woman just brought bizarre ecstasy to his mind.\n\nThe moment he thought about it, he noticed her eyes narrow even further, piercing her glare right through him and making him flinch backwards in fear.\n\n“What do you mean you’re out of stock, dipshit?!”\n\nA cold-hearted voice escaped her mouth.\n\nHe felt cold sweat dripping down from his forehead upon hearing her voice again, “I-It means that… there’s no more, ma’am.”\n\n“I see…,” she sighed.\n\nErina placed both her hands on the counter and leaned on it.\n\nHer frustration was building up to the maximum that she felt ready to wreck everything here in this place. There had to be something external to vent out her anger. It was a bad habit… more likely a great issue about her mentality, but she couldn’t do anything about it — at least, never took the effort to.\n\nA long day was still ahead of her.\n\nHer employer, who she still hasn’t signed a contract with, was kind enough to let her grab something for herself after they had left from her school. And just so it happened, he was in his car parked right outside of the store, waiting for her to be done with her business.\n\nSo, even with her issue, she had to avert any problem that irked her. She didn’t want to pose any more of a bad impression.\n\nThe story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.\n\nBut…\n\n「Why can't I just have what I want?」\n\nDespite being twenty-one years old, there was still that lingering touch of an angsty teenager swelling up within her. Some could say it had been only a few years since she had turned eighteen, so she was still fresh off teenagehood. But she thought otherwise, she wanted to maintain her image as an adult now.\n\nThere was only one thing that she just could not ignore.\n\n“Just give me my Taku Puffs, and you’ll never see me again. I don’t see where the problem is,” she held her fist tightly from doing anything irrational.\n\n“Ma’am, I’d give you your Taku puffs if I had any.” The employee enunciated every word carefully. He tried holding in his fear, because he couldn’t tolerate the disrespect she had given him, “And I’ll have to ask you to leave now.”\n\nIgnoring his last statement, she closed her eyes and put on a threatening smile, “Then why am I seeing Taku boxes inside that room over there?”\n\nShe pointed at the door beside the employee, which was slightly open and showed a bunch of blue boxes hidden within the darkness. That was the only thing keeping her from leaving and holding onto her argument. It could be that those were empty, but that still did not deter her away from getting an answer.\n\nThe employee recoiled, “Uh… T-Those are for next week. We can’t sell them now because then, we’d have no stock.”\n\nHe wasn’t lying. Of course, she could try the method where she would shake him off from everything he had like a thug till he gave her what she wanted, but Erina was feeling generous today — mainly due to her increased fatigue.\n\n「Dammit…」\n\n“Please understand, ma’am. I have no say in this. I could, however, offer you a coupon you could use for later?” He tried to compensate her with anything that wouldn’t result in her possibly crashing the store.\n\n“Shove it up your ass before I turn your goddamn head into a windmill…” She raised her head and spoke with the same low tone, yet the hostility in it was greater than ever, “You’re pissing me off, you know that um…,” she glanced at his nametag, “Lloyd… You’re annoying, Lloyd! I don’t like you. Now, tell me you have something— anything in this store before I shove you into a microwave?”\n\nThe employee lowered his head and pointed forward to the end of the store. There was a smoothie machine placed right in the center, but it was barely touched during the wave of people swarming the store. It might have to do with the fact that the smoothies themselves were not that great. No sane person would ever drink a smoothie made out of peanut butter, and even the slightly less worse drink, strawberry, which tasted spoiled.\n\n“...” Erina lowered her head and let out a deep groan.\n\nShe was desperate… she needed something sweet quickly. Every store she stopped by before this one was the same, however, there was the smoothie machine now. It was going to throw her into a three-day coma, but she had no choice.\n\nShe walked backwards and kept her glare locked at the employee, “I’m coming back for you. If those puffs aren’t here next week, they’re not going to be the only thing that’s bloated, Lloyd.” She pointed at her head for a second before turning back.\n\n*bump*\n\nJust as she turned, her body crashed with someone else’s, causing them both to jolt backwards at each of their opposing sides.\n\nIt barely affected Erina, but that didn’t stop her from being annoyed by it. “Watch where you’re going!” She shouted.\n\nIn front of her was a young girl with pink hair, she was shorter than her by quite a bit — it wasn't exactly an excuse for her to not notice her at first. She was rubbing the back of her head in pain. It was then that she noticed the bandage wrapped around her head. However, instead of feeling bad for her, she was just about as ready to start an argument with her as any senile old man would.\n\nHowever—\n\n“Sorry, I should have been more careful.” The girl smiled and then left.\n\nEven though it really wasn’t her fault, she apologized, as simple as that. She did not take a second to look at her to either be intimidated by her appearance or scoff and give her the cold shoulder before leaving. It was most likely a matter of her being in a hurry to be bothered by it.\n\nYet still, it touched Erina a bit, causing a wry expression on her face.\n\n「Someone decent for once.」\n\nMaking her way to the back of the store, she approached the machine and for a moment, she hesitated, berating herself for having to settle for a horrible drink. The stench was already clear enough that she wouldn’t even dare push the button. But, as she proceeded to grab a cup and fill it, she needed to answer the cries of her poor stomach.\n\nDone with the soon-to-be regretful ordeal, she quickly trotted back to the counter. The young girl from earlier was nowhere in sight, which was of no concern to her. Only the young cashier was there, like he always was — somehow, in the back of her mind, she wished for him to disintegrate into nothing just so she can grab that “secret” stash in the backroom. She chuckled.\n\n“S-So…,” the employee stuttered, “Is that all… m-miss?”\n\n「You wish!」\n\nThat thought had almost gotten her to sneer at the employee. Yet, she tried her best to remain composed and content with the situation. After all, with her boss outside, there was no time to play around and make a fuss.\n\nBefore they could proceed with the checkout—\n\n“HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE EM!!!”\n\nA man had rushed into the store…\n\n“Give me all the stock you got and no one gets hurt!”\n\n…a man with a gun.\n\n「Wonderful…!」",

It is something that people convince themselves of, in order to set a make-believe goal. It is the end of the road that one could never reach. It is the dream that one wishes for, but complains that society is bringing them down and keeping them from achieving it. To put it simply, it is all an illusion, a fairy tale everyone keeps telling to everyone. And that is how the “perfect society” exists.\n\nBut there is no such thing as the “perfect” system. There never was.\n\nThat was the case with the robber, a lawful citizen that descended into poverty because of a right he was robbed of, more specifically because of a crime he was a victim of. At least, that was what he believed — if you consider starving yourself to death because all of your favourite “snacks” were devoured a crime against your right.\n\n“Give me all the stock you got and no one gets hurt!”\n\nStanding at the entrance to a convenience store, the only one he had found to still have some life to it in the barren town, he trembled as sweat dripped down from his cheeks. He pointed his gun at the only two individuals in the place, the store employee and a young woman cladded in a red gym attire. This was an optimal situation for him, the less people there were; the better his chances were at going through with this robbery.\n\n“You think you can hoard all this food to yourself and leave nothing to the working people?” He said, “You capitalist ass kissers! Don’t you have a shred of humanity?!”\n\nHowever, truth be told, the odds were heavily stacked against his favour: Erina Nightingale was there.\n\n「Give me a break… I will literally kill somebody just have the day pass smoothly.」\n\nBarely intimated, but fearful for whatever that panic-driven robber might do to others, Erina slowly reached for her pockets, yet the robber’s erratic nature had caused her to flinch and drop whatever was in her pocket on the ground. It was a pen; an antique pen. As the man was still focused on the employee, shouting for his demands to be met, she kneeled to grab the man off the floor.\n\n“H-Hey!” The robber had noticed her odd movement.\n\n「Shit… This can’t get any worse.」\n\n“I said hands in the air! Don’t try anything funny!”\n\nWith a stern look on her face, she raised her hands up and away from her pockets as she pulled herself back up. “You do know you’re robbing an empty store, right?” She remarked on the robber’s odd decision to rob the store.\n\n“Bullshit!” He said.\n\n“No, it’s t-true,” the employee spoke up and frantically nodded, “Everyone bought their stuff in the dozen. We’re out of stock for almost everything.”\n\n“Shut up!” The robber pointed his gun back at the employee. For a moment, he glanced at the slightly open room to the back of the employee and smiled. “You’re just saying what they tell you to say. Give me those boxes in the back!”\n\n「Not the Taku Puffs…」\n\nLove this story? Find the genuine version on the author's preferred platform and support their work!\n\nIf the robber were to ever lay his hands on the boxes; she desperately desired, there was no telling what she might do. This was her punishment for abiding by the law, she believed. So, if breaking a few rules was her gateway to get what she wanted and get out of this ludicrous situation, then so be it.\n\nErina took a deep breath.\n\nAll of a sudden, she disintegrated from the robber’s sight, which baffled him, putting him completely off-guard. Before he could regain his composure, she was already next to him — her speed was incomprehensible.\n\n“What the…?”\n\nJust before he could finish his sentence, she reached for his hand and grabbed it, attempting to disarm him of his gun. The robber was completely taken aback by her absurd overwhelming strength over him. However, it wasn’t enough, and with there still being an innocent bystander in the mix, she needed to act quickly. Without a second thought, she lowered his arm with her right hand to point the gun away from endangering anyone else and then smacked her left elbow into his face.\n\nStill, it wasn’t enough. She might have been very much strong; stronger than the robber, but he had his grip locked to the gun. He wasn’t about to let his only chance die down so easily.\n\nErina clenched her teeth, and her eyes were seething with anger. “Guess I have no choice.” She let go of the robber’s arm before pushing him as far away as she could from the counter.\n\nCrashing into one of the display shelves, causing most of the items to fall off, the robber tried to regain his footing, “That hurt, you bitch! I’ll kill you!!!”\n\nShe paid no heed to the robber’s outrageousness. Instead, she calmly brushed herself off from any dust that her clothes might have gathered earlier. After that, she reached for her right arm and started rolling up the sleeve. What unfolded underneath was baffling to both the man and the employee, who stood behind the counter still watching with caution. There were bandages, old and battered, wrapped around her arm up till her elbow.\n\nThe robber was lost for words. He would almost mumble to himself from the sheer number of bandages covering her right arm alone, for her left arm was all the same, even her fingers, now that he noticed, were covered by those same bandages. Anyone seeing this unfathomable appearance of the girl would instantly mistake her for an escaped convict from an asylum of some sorts — not to mention the sick look of depravity and mercilessness in her eyes.\n\nErina Nightingale was mad.\n\n“Shoot me…,” she was mad without a doubt. As the bandages started unwrapping on their own, a smirk was drawn on her face; a malicious smirk equally terrifying as her piercing eyes, “…if you got the guts…”\n\nAnd with those last words, the trigger within was set off. The robber, despite being panicked and confused, felt wrath boiling from up to the brim on the inside. He had come into this place to take what was rightfully his; not to get himself chewed out by a random woman like a ragdoll. He could not stand further humiliation.\n\nJust then, his finger clicked. The gun fired.\n\nIt blasted off directly at the woman, leaving behind only smoke and dust in the process and clouding the man’s vision. His trembling had stopped, there were only his eyes; his petrified eyes gazing into the smoke, struggling for vision. The sound of lead dropping echoed in his ears.\n\nAs his vision became clearer through the smoke, he noticed the bullet, the one that he had fired off, resting on the floor. The thought of missing his aim due to panic at the time came to him, but his mind was too clouded with shock to even think of what could have happened. It was then that he almost found himself screaming at the top of his lungs.\n\nBefore the bullet on the floor stood Erina, unscathed and unharmed, her right arm locked forward and emitting smoke as if it had been on fire. She had blocked the bullet with just her hand.\n\nAny doubt the robber might have had before was completely thrown out of the window the moment he saw her; he was absolutely terrified of her. He quickly rose to his feet and attempted to back away from her.\n\nHer right arm, now visible for everyone to see, was completely coated in a weird spiral of tattoos— no, they weren’t tattoos —they were words, many words and letters plastered across her arm, ingrained deep within her skin. Not leaving a chance for even a comment, the words on her arm glowed as heat and smoke proceeded to emit from her arm.\n\n“You’re getting cremated today, shitface!”\n\nThe robber tried to run away but it was all too late. Erina shot her punch into his gut like an arrow from a bow.\n\nHowever, he wasn’t the only one that felt the impact of her strike.\n\nA sonic blast occurred from the moment her fist met his gut, blowing the robber away from her sight, and shattering the store’s windows. The blast range had been so vast; it had reached the neighboring street, affecting the cars nestling in the street and pushing away anyone it met in its path. Naturally, half the car alarms in the neighborhood went off, signaling all attention toward the store.\n\nWhen she realized what the impact of her punch had done, Erina was shocked.\n\n“Oops…”",

            "content": "Arc 0: Chapter 4 - Nightingale of Red\n\nred /rɛd/\n\nused to denote something forbidden, dangerous, or urgent.\n\nFlynn had been resting in his car at the time, completely oblivious to what was going on just around the corner. Only tumbleweed passed through the street, the neighbourhood remained perfectly still, locked in stasis, even the random pedestrians that would often walk by here and there were nowhere to be found. Taking in another blast of smoke from his cigarette, Flynn pondered over his surroundings. Based on what he had gathered earlier, the curfew wasn’t till dark, but light was still as bright as ever in the golden sky above.\n\nHowever, that wasn’t the only thing bothering him at the moment. There was one matter that remained to irk him wherever he went, the matter of his apprentice. When he had taken his position here in the town, he never expected to be babysitting a reckless girl who valued her sweet tooth over her work.\n\n「What’s taking her so long?」\n\nThe girl, Erina Nightingale, was a daughter of the esteemed Nightingale family. The Nightingales were not only the richest family in this dull town but they were one of the most prestigious parties elsewhere. Known for their elegant upbringings, their women were always strong and firm in their manners but they also maintained proper etiquette and beliefs — a notion that was soon shattered by one Aurora Nightingale, or so it was said. Lo and behold, their offspring would be anything but elegant in this new age.\n\n“Can’t blame anyone but yourself, Locke,” Flynn spoke to himself as means to break the dead silence that almost engulfed him with his thoughts. He inhaled the last bit of smoke from his cigarette before putting it off and throwing it away.\n\nAt that moment, he felt the ground beneath him slightly tremble along with his car — the shaking of the cigarette box in front of his dashboard told him so easily. He wrinkled his eyebrows at this odd occurrence. Yet before he could gather his thoughts on what was going on, his mind had already drifted away to Neverland.\n\nOut of the blue, the whole car sprung up high, tilting up to the left as a great pressure of shrieking wind pushed against Flynn and his car like a whirlpool. The gust was terrifying enough to shatter all the windows to not only the car but nearby cars and buildings; it was baffling. And just when the car was on the verge of flipping over itself on the ground, the wind retracted and the car crashed back in its place, shattering more of the remaining glass inside.\n\nThe street grew silent once more.\n\nFlynn remained in shock. He would have almost fallen out of his car and possibly crushed underneath it had there been another gust. When he came to, he realized some of the nearby cars had already been flipped over. He did not have the time to pity the poor schmucks who owned those cars. Like a shot, he jumped off his seat to the next one and eyed the store that was to his right; the store that Erina was supposedly; the store that the wind had come from.\n\nThis content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\n\nThe look of shock and despair did not leave Flynn’s eyes as he realized the truth of this strange situation. Inside the now mess of a store, with its shattered windows and broken shelves, was Erina. She had her arm locked in an offensive position right in front of her. Her sleeve had been rolled up and her bandages were gone, only the plethora of words plastered on her arm remained, they were burning brightly with steam before eventually calming down.\n\n「No…」\n\nRealizing the truth and nature of Erina’s chaotic power, Flynn fell speechless. He could do nothing but lament his fate for this was only the start. “You’ve got to be shitting me.”\n\n△▼△▼△▼△\n\nDeep at the end of the store, the robber laid down unconscious on the ground among the debris, the top of his pants riddled with a dark stain. The impact of Erina’s punch had blasted him away, causing him to crash through the lanes and shelves, and ending up on the other end of the store. Above him was the broken smoothie machine, and true enough to the robber’s downtrodden luck, the machine had somehow sprung back to life and proceeded to pour down a river of peanut butter on him.\n\n“Ugh…,” Erina looked away in disgust as she retreated her arm back.\n\nIt was then that she felt a sharp sting pierce through it, and yet she held back the pain. Wrapping the bandages around her arm, she rolled down her sleeve afterwards and turned to look back at the counter.\n\nThe boy, the employee, stood petrified at her, his surroundings were a mess but he remained as still as ever. He flinched the moment her eyes met his and quickly ran to the backroom. She could not contain her satisfied grin.\n\nAfter he had returned with the blue boxes in hand, Erina could not help but shift away from her twisted gaze as her eyes sparkled gloriously with ecstasy from seeing what she longed for right in front of her for the taking. “Taku Puffs…,” she drooled as she fantasized herself hugging a giant cream puff.\n\nStill terrified, the boy placed the boxes on the counter before pushing them forward to the front for her to grab. Instead of chewing her out for wrecking the store to bits, he obeyed her wishes easily and remained silent throughout the whole process — after all, he was simply an employee.\n\nWith a winning smile drawn on her face, Erina walked over to the counter confidently, “A gift? For me? You really shouldn’t have!” She took no time in opening one of the boxes and grabbing a package for herself.\n\n“No wonder Shogo didn’t take you!” Flynn Locke, her boss, rushed into the store, breathing in and out as if he had just run through a marathon, yet his face carried disappointment.\n\nHearing his words, Erina’s smile faded.\n\n“You’re a Maverick!” He said as he approached her. He snatched the package from her before placing it back on the counter, “But you’re still a reckless teenage girl. They told me you’d be experienced, but all I see is a girl who has too much angst to work through.”\n\nShe clenched her teeth, “That’s not—”\n\n“End of discussion!” He said. Looking over at the terrified boy, who loosened up after seeing him, he glanced up at the corners of the ceiling for a moment. Nothing seemed to be wrong, and that was enough to ease his thoughts. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out his wallet and then handed over some money to the boy. “Here! That should be enough to fix the place.”\n\n“Oh?!” The boy was baffled by the amount of money, “I-I can’t take this, sir.”\n\n“You should and you will,” he turned away the boy’s hand as he tried to return the money, “Half that’s for you — not a word of this to anyone, you hear me, lad?”\n\nThe boy nodded, even with the hesitation still visible on his face.\n\n“Good, the watchmen will be here soon to wrap up the mess.” Flynn let out a sigh of relief, yet the tension never left his body. He looked back at Erina, who remained awfully silent with her lips downturned; she resembled a child almost having a tantrum. “We're leaving, kid!”\n\n“I’m not a kid!” She retaliated.\n\nHe widened his eyes firmly, “Move. It.”\n\nAs the two walked out, Flynn only had one thought on his mind: he carried a ticking time bomb in his grasp.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Chapter 5 - Maverick Authority\n\nauthor /ˈɔːθə/\n\nthe writer of a book, article, play, etc.\n\nAuthority. Such magnificent power was beyond human capabilities, it bore only the epitome of facade in fantasy; yet in this town that oozed melancholy in place of mystery, it persisted. Much like its name, it revolved around Authors, but not the ones you would know by name — certainly not of the normal kind — for these authors knew far too much and kept themselves in secrecy to the grander world. Wizards, they’d be called by some, practitioners of witchcraft and the like; a concept that would be more comprehensible than whatever the authors truly were. They knew not witchcraft nor wizardry, but simply the knowledge and fantasy of imagination.\n\nIt was the mystical art of words and the outlet of imagination into reality. Brandishing their pens and their quills, and through the use of writing on mere air, authors were able to conjure whatever their mind hid in that small corner of innocence and fantasy. If one desired to wield their favorite fictional weapon, then with Authority, it would easily come true, though it required precision and skill. This power was chaotic in nature; it offered as much freedom as one desired, and so there were limitations. One had to master it if they ever-so pleased to become an author.\n\nAnd so come Flynn and Erina, two authors of varying nature; yet still alike all the same. The authors were divided into classes, each with their own skill in which they specialized and dedicated all their studies to — and then, there were some who possessed skills unique only to them.\n\nFlynn was but a simple novelist, one that could create fictional scenarios out of nothing to aid him. For a novelist summoning an army of undead would be nothing more than a triviality — assuming the writing aligned within comprehension. On the other hand, Erina, just a youth who barely hit her twenties, was a maverick.\n\n“That man was robbing the store! I did a public service.” She scoffed, burying herself further within the passenger seat.\n\nBoth Flynn and her were now in his car, which still managed to keep itself together even after the blast that had occurred, and it posed no problem to Flynn as he could easily fix it with Authority later. The problem, however, lied with the little lady coughing up a storm beside him.\n\n“A tad excessive, wouldn’t you say so? I’m sure those car owners will accept your generosity with utmost care. Oh, and leaving shattered windows is quite the public service.” Flynn said. Still trying to comprehend Erina’s actions and line of thinking, he rubbed his forehead before letting out a deep sigh. By no means was her desire to stop the robbery wrong, although given different circumstances she wouldn’t have bothered to stop it at all at one point, it was the method by which she did that worried Flynn greatly. Not only did she cause a great commotion and potentially exposed her supernatural nature to bystanders who knew nothing of it, but she also had no direct control over this chaotic, destructive power. “You’re washing your arms first thing when we get to the office. And get rid of those bandages!”\n\nUnauthorized content usage: if you discover this narrative on Amazon, report the violation.\n\n“What?!” She retorted, “Who are you to boss me around?!!”\n\n“Your boss…!” he said after being stung by a bit of irritation.\n\nUnlike authors, even of the magical kind, mavericks were a little bit of a special case. They valued the perspective of one’s self, their power focused on the betterment of themselves, more specifically, how they could enhance their own physical prowess to unimaginable degrees. If one were to simplify it, they were “brutes” of Authority. That said, they weren’t so mindless in their techniques, they couldn’t be. After all, their techniques were the hardest there is to master as it required them to be very detailed with their creations, they needed to understand the functions of their own bodies above all.\n\nFor Erina Nightingale, the reckless hothead, to be capable of such ability seemed absurd, and her abuse of it made it all the more evident.\n\n「Can’t deny she’s smart though.」\n\nStill in the silent car, Flynn sat thinking of Erina and her technique. He thought about how effective her bandages method was. Mavericks tend to write with precision so to do that in the heat of battle seemed almost impossible and remained to be one of the reasons why there weren’t that many of them.\n\nAuthors weren’t brawlers who would strike up a fight whenever they went, but when they happened to be in one, especially with outworldly beings, they needed to be prepared.\n\nErina, however, took that concept and flipped it over its head. She used her special bandages around her arms to suppress her power and have it at the ready whenever she needed instead of writing it all in the heat of the moment. Yet it still proved to be a fatal flaw.\n\nFlynn glanced at her for a moment. Arms crossed, she had her head turned in the other direction and looked at the window, as if she was rejecting all reasons to speak. It brought a smile to Flynn’s face, who could not help but chuckle at the situation in spite of his earlier remarks.\n\n“Just don’t do that again,” he said, trying to keep a firm front. He turned the keys and started up the car, “You’re under my watch, now. Try to behave yourself a little.”\n\n“Sure…” She answered almost immediately with a dull tone.\n\nHer gaze still plastered to the window, she wouldn’t move an inch. There was no doubt that she was mad. But she also felt an ache in her heart, she was sad. Deep down, she believed that Flynn had every right to scold her. She was way past the age of adolescence, yet continued to act like a teenager who didn’t know better about consequences. It was no wonder why she was still in school, she believed.\n\nErina loathed herself.\n\nAll of a sudden, a box dropped onto her lap, startling her for a moment. She eyed it with surprise. It was a paper blue box with various emblems of sweets plastered on top of it and from the sides. This was none other than a box of Taku Puffs.\n\n“Huuuh?! W-Why?” Erina was puzzled. She would have very well devoured the box almost immediately yet she couldn’t bring herself to till she understood why. “Why the hell… so after all that, you're just rewarding me with what I wanted? What kind of teacher are you?”\n\nFlynn rubbed the back of his head. For a man with a few years till he hit his fourities, he still didn’t know how to hide his embarrassment. “No. But you’re old enough to know when you’ve done wrong. Unless of course, you adhere to the ways of our dear friend, Pavlov,” he chuckled, “Besides, I can’t handle the sound of your stomach growling.”\n\n“Hey!” Erina snarled before slowly softening her expression, “Thanks!”\n\nOddly enough, despite her prudish nature and gruff appearance, she seemed to have a rather sweet and childish side to her; the kind that would leave one with a smile whenever they looked at her when she showed it — even if that side was partially the reason a store had blown up almost beyond measure.\n\n「This kid’s going to be the end of me.」\n\nFlynn smiled as he drove off to the distance. It was time for the office.",

            "content": "Arc 0: Chapter 6 - Rest For The Weary\n\nSituated on the doorstep of the tall building on Heming Street was none other than Mr. Kingsley, the man with the keys to the office, the self-titled landlord, even though the office was, in fact, the only room in the building he owned.\n\nKingsley was of a peculiar size and age, the man was hitting the edge of his sixties, or he could very well be an adult’s grandfather already. Everything about the man, besides his age and voice, was of the typical kind, he was the type of man who would complain about anything, but never actually seek to fix anything.\n\nWith his bright multi-colored striped shirt and his oversized plain beige pants, Kingsley certainly looked like the kind of father that was ready to burn whatever money he had since he probably already had his dreamboat, but the three, perhaps four counting a toddler, spoiled brats that he raised would stop him from doing so.\n\n“Ah, you must be the guy I’m looking for… Mister Locke, right?” Kingsley welcomed Flynn with open arms.\n\n“Y-Yes yes, that’s me!” Flynn replied as he struggled for air. The man’s “hug” was just too tough to deal with.\n\n“Well well, I’m glad to finally meet ya. Watchmen’s been talking about ya day and night, what’d you say you worked as before?”\n\n“Same job really…,” he replied once again. However, there was something else on his mind. Kingsley’s earlier comment about the watchmen’s gossip seemed rather odd to him, he was just a random new inspector in town, nothing special about him. ‘B-But why… why would the watchmen talk about me?’\n\n“Oh, ya’know, you’re a private inspector and stuff. Pretty rare occasion in a beat-up town like ours, surprised they let you through in the first place. I bet some of ‘em people are already talking about ya — it’s not everyday they meet an unfamiliar face.”\n\nHe was right. Flynn was just overthinking, but it was natural, things have been bizarre for quite a while that taking notice of small comments like that was nothing. He felt at ease for some reason. This town was so old that it’s population always remained the same, and everyone knew each other. He always wished for that kind of familiarity in his life, to not only know his neighbor, but everyone around him. Something like that was sure to bring some warmth to his heart, as opposed to the cold environment of the city were everyone’s to themselves and strangers are strangers.\n\n“But don't worry about all that. We’ll make you feel right at home in no time. I bet them Binaria guys are preparing a welcome party for you and then some — they always do that with new customers at their cafe here. What’d you say you were, again? Forty-five?”\n\nIf you stumble upon this tale on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\n\nFlynn was baffled, “Thirty-seven! I never mentioned my age before…”\n\n“My bad… thought you looked Forty-five. It doesn't matter though.”\n\nKingsley tried to greet Erina, who stood a little far behind Flynn (her mouth smudged with the second cream puff she was eating that day) but immediately turned away in fear when she gave him a threatening glare. “Eheh, that woman uh…,” his tone had shifted to a rather worrisome one, “She with you?”\n\nFlynn briefly glanced at her and sighed, “Unfortunately…”\n\n“I-In any case, welcome to our esteemed town!” He climbed the stairs and stepped through the entrance as the two followed behind him. “It’s a shabby old flat, but it ain’t bad even for an office, so I do hope you make yourself at home. It’d be a shame if we were to chase you away, Mister Locke. Things have been looking rather peculiar in this town as of late. We need someone like you.”\n\nBefore they knew it, the door to the office was right in front of them. Kingsley rummaged through his keys until he finally found the right one and unlocked the door open.\n\nHowever, Flynn’s mind was elsewhere, “Someone like me?!” He raised an eyebrow to Kingsley’s earlier remark.\n\n“Um, you know,” Kingsley’s head trembled as he tried to find the words to use, “ghost… g-ghost inspector and the like.”\n\nA smile formed on Flynn’s face, “I’m just your average private inspector.” He tapped his hand on Kingsley’s shoulder before stepping inside the office along with Erina right behind him (her hand deep inside the box of Taku Puffs, looking for more after she had finished the one she had).\n\nTaking a brief glance at the place, he was able to quickly surmise what to do with it. It was quite old, as Kingsley had said earlier, the floor creaked beneath their feet, the wood slightly bounced off with each step. The ceiling was coming off but the walls were freshly painted in an odd color of orange. Sewage-infested water dribbled down from the broken sink in the kitchen. A fireplace nestled itself in the center wall facing the entrance, it was riddled with dust and reeking of whatever odor the dead verments possessed. However, Flynn paid no heed to any of those details. All that mattered to him was the space and this was more than enough.\n\n“Itsh nish!” Erina remarked, her mouth stuffed with food.\n\n“Yeah, we’ll manage.” Flynn nodded. “You shouldn’t buy into gossip, dear Mister Kingsley. The more you listen, the deeper you go down the rabbit hole. And you know what they say,” he turned and approached him at the doorstep, “beware of the rabbits and always keep to yourself.”\n\n“Who says?” Kingsley was baffled.\n\nFlynn widened his smirk, “Tom Bombadil.” He shut the door.\n\nStartled by the door shutting in his face, Kingsley turned away, his face riddled in confusion. “Who’s Tom Bombadil?”",

            "content": "Arc 0: Chapter 7 - What Lies Between Words\n\nFlynn Locke was a private inspector, that much was true. Any claim that he wandered about in the world of the paranormal would be immediately shut down whenever it crossed him. Even though it was merely an independent investigation agency with only him, and now the girl that was to be his assistant, the cases he had come across before happened to fall under the pretense of the “paranormal,” which led to the spark of gossip surrounding him now.\n\n“Anyone asks you anything, you deny it in any way you see fit — like what I just did — confuse them, call them crazy,” Flynn explained to Erina what she were to do if asked about the paranormal — a fair warning to her previous reckless encounter. “What matters is keeping your mouth shut. That’s always been the rule.”\n\nStill, who was to say the paranormal never really existed? If it did, it would certainly be magical.\n\nWith the flicker of the pen in Flynn’s hand, and a little of gold dust, the battered office soon shifted to something else entirely. The old wooden floorboards flew out of their places and dissipated into thin air, replaced by a bundle of cluttered letters, formed out of the gold dust, before swiftly coating the floor with new and smooth tiles. The ceiling, even the new orange-colored walls, were soon painted by a tinge of white and grey colors. As for the areas with the sewage pipes and the fireplace, they were all but entirely gone from sight, and in their places were brand new amenities: a small open kitchen with enough equipment to whip up coffee and a few snacks, and a “lounge” coupled with two couches facing each other, separated by a coffee table, and a few extra pieces of furniture here and there. It was an entirely new office.\n\nUnauthorized usage: this narrative is on Amazon without the author's consent. Report any sightings.\n\n“Impressive!” Erina smirked, trying to hide her astonishment. He’s the real deal, she would think, her powers couldn’t even hope to be compared to this magical transformation. She would throw a glance at Flynn as she felt her inferiority seep in. Beyond all titles and ranks, that man, that seemingly washed-up detective, was a grand wizard, and she was just… her, a twenty-year-old woman who couldn’t keep her act together. “All right, all right! I get it, you’re a novelist. Can we move onto the good stuff now?”\n\nAs he moved over his suitcase to the freshly conceived desk, Flynn spoke, “Define “good” stuff.” He already knew the answer, she was too easy to read. “We’re in a rundown town. You don’t expect to find a mythical creature here and there, do you?” He chuckled as he unpacked his stuff, “Or perhaps you want me to finally take you out of this town and down to Neverland to live your dreams? Is that it?”\n\n“I…,” she was at a loss for words. He had gotten every thought right, yet that accomplishment had only caused to irk her more. “Well, what else am I supposed to do?”\n\n“Sit down, relax,” he said, “and prepare yourself because our first case is arriving shortly.”\n\n“What? H-How?!”\n\n“I may have heard something from a curious cat on the way to your school,” he approached Erina, “But now it’s up to the rabbit to lure Alice into the trial.”\n\nShe stood trembling. She didn’t dare speak what was on her mind, for if she did, it would certainly turn out to be true.\n\n“You want to do something instead of waiting around? Well, here’s your first assignment, kid,” he said. He smiled and placed his hand on her shoulder, “Find our first case!”\n\n“Huuuh?!” She groaned, leaving her mouth agape and her eyes shot open.\n\n“Work that brain of yours and,” he leaned closer, his smile widening, “Find. Our. First. Case.”\n\nErina Nightingale’s day was just getting started.",

With twilight dawning in the sky, she stood in the middle of her garden, watching her surroundings with a solemn expression. This was her family’s garden, or more particularly her great grandfather’s garden, whom she had never met but heard so many stories about. Her great grandfather was an odd fellow, she was once told. A garden full of roses and lilies would be much more to his liking than to do anything else.\n\nBeing seventeen years of age, Juno understood none of it. It was not common for a girl her age to be interested in such a dull hobby, at least that was what she believed. When it came to who she was, there wasn’t anything particularly special about her — a girl who was almost average in everything. Only carrying smiles and bright eyes to her face, she wore the standard school uniform most of the time, and made little to no effort to give her appearance a sense of uniqueness. However, she was known for standing out within groups with her foolish demeanor. And instead of being met with strange looks, her mystical charm granted her the privilege of becoming a source of joy for many of whom she knew in this humourless town.\n\nThough that mystical charm entranced all that met its gaze, there was one person, who seemed entirely unaffected by it: the boy with no ambitions. Opposite to her manners, yet similar all the same, the boy sat down on the grass right in front of her, humming a lullaby and admiring the plethora of flowers encasing the edges of the garden.\n\n“Hey, Lloyd!” She nudged him with her foot but once again, she was met with no response. Despite being almost of Juno’s age, a rather young one, that boy was the gardener.\n\nIt was just around this time of day years ago when her mother had stumbled upon him in an empty lot on one of the backstreets. With no one or shelter to call home, and only a single name to his identity, he was a nobody in the eyes of many, an extra baggage that would soon bring trouble. But Juno’s mother, weak of heart, grew rather fond of the little boy and immediately adopted him into the family.\n\nNow, almost ten years later, he still remained with family, never to pose any trouble. Though it was something greatly discouraged by her mother, even till this day, he chose to work for the Ashfords, a small price to pay the debt he forever owed the family, he believed.\n\n“Hey…,” Juno called out. With their circumstances, it could be easily said that she and he were more or less childhood friends, siblings even. “What are you doing?” She tried to connect with him over anything, after all, they were just friends in name only. True to his nature, he had kept himself rather distant from her, treating her with the respect one would give to their employer — something that somewhat saddened Juno. Annoyed by his lack of response, she kneeled beside him, eying the flowers with wonder before looking back at him, “Stop ignoring me!”\n\n“I’m not ignoring you,” he finally answered, “I’m just too focused right now. We can talk later.” Turning to look at her, he almost gave her a look of disappointment before carefully pushing up her head, “And don’t stand like that! Your injury is not fully healed yet, you never know what might happen if you tilt your head too much.”\n\n“Oh?” She backed away and touched the back of her head, which was encased with a bandage, “Ehehe, I had almost forgotten about that.”\n\n“Hey, watch it!” Lloyd shouted.\n\nAt that moment, she was startled by his sudden loud voice as he walked backwards and almost lost her balance. Lloyd instantly came up to his feet and pulled her back. It was quite an amazing feat on how he managed to catch her so quickly.\n\nStanding in front of each other, Juno easily towered over him, causing an awkward difference in height, which he didn’t seem to be bothered by. Rather, he was bothered by something else entirely, “You almost stepped on the flowers!”\n\nIf you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\n\nHearing that brash response slightly irritated Juno, “You little…,” she twitched and clenched her teeth, “You little jerk! I almost fell and crushed my head, and all you care about is a stupid flower?! I thought you were worried about my injury.”\n\n“It’s not a stupid flower,” he crouched and shielded the flower with his hands, “It’s a living being!”\n\nShe sighed, “Doesn’t make this any better.”\n\n“I really don’t get you…,” he let out a deep exhale. Getting up on his feet, he walked over to Juno to check up on her injury, “You look fine. Besides, it’s not my fault if anything happens. You’re in no condition for any outside activities. Still you flounder around, doing whatever you please, like nothing’s wrong.”\n\nDue to an accident in an attempt to save an upperclassman of hers, Juno fell into the hands of the hospital for a couple of weeks. Miraculously, however — be it an act of divine or not — both she, and the boy he had saved, suffered major injuries that weren’t impossible to treat or overcome — not to mention their smooth recovery in less than a week. It truly was unbelievable. Anyone facing the speed of a giant truck at a hundred kilometres per hour would surely be six feet under right now.\n\nComing to terms with her situation, Juno wore a somber look. “...I know that already…”\n\nLloyd had a similar expression on his face, although he was feeling sorry for her rather than being sad himself. It was unusual for the girl who always smiled to give such an expression. “Hey… H-Hey, I was just having a laugh — God, I’m horrible at these.”\n\n“It’s all right! I…,” she held her tongue for a moment. She looked at Lloyd and put on an apologetic smile. “I’m all better now. But you should work on your jokes. Anyone else might have taken it differently.”\n\n“I know. I know,” he scratched the back of his head in embarrassment, “Enough rubbing salt on the wound.”\n\nIt was at times like these — which happened more often than not, to say the least — that she was reminded of his age. Though he would act responsible at times, he was still a childish teenager that wasn’t exactly better than her. However, such realization would only bring a smile to her face each time she remembered, it was a reminder that all was well.\n\n“But man, I can’t believe I missed Halloween!” She laughed, letting her usual demeanor back. She believed in a positive outlook no matter what, she could not spend her time moping around when she could still do something. “I sure was looking forward to it, especially after the work I’ve put in.”\n\n“Don’t worry, you didn’t miss out much,” he tapped his hands on her shoulder twice, as a sort of gesture to cheer her up, before he walked away to pack up his gardening tools, “It got cancelled after all, and… you know… with what happened.”\n\n“Oh…,” she held her hand over her mouth, “Right…”\n\n「I almost forgot.」\n\nThat wasn’t something to be easily forgotten. She started to wonder if the accident really racked her mind more than she thought.\n\nBefore she could dwell on it further, Lloyd was one step ahead of her and smacked her on the head with a rolled up paper in his hand.\n\n“Ouch!!!” She cried as she quickly put her hand over her head. “What’d you do that for?”\n\n“Beating you before you beat yourself up over nothing you have no relation to.” He said with a firm look on her face, “Stop the self-reproach and just live like everyone else.”\n\n“I don’t think it works like that, Lloyd…” She grunted.\n\n“Oh, cheer up!” He punched her arm lightly, to give her a “poke” of some sort.\n\nHowever, she did not take it as so. “Gah! Would you please stop? Not everyone in the world is built like a pony wall.” It resulted in her blurting out words that she should have thought twice about saying.\n\n“Who are you calling a midget?!”\n\nDespite not being said directly, he knew that comment of hers was for him specifically. When she looked at him, she saw his eyes shine bright with malice and a wide irritated smile on his face, and to top it all off, he cracked both of his knuckles. In his eyes, it was a scene of a demonic being ready to snatch the soul of its victim without remorse.\n\n“Uh hehe,” she chuckled nervously.\n\n“Hey, you two!” A voice called out from the distance, “Stop your quarrels and get in here already! The sun’s almost down.”\n\nThe two teenagers turned their heads to the caller. It was ██████.\n\n“All right, we’ll be right over there!” Juno shouted.\n\nHer call had come at the right time.\n\nOther than saving her skin from Lloyd’s wrath, there was something that she hadn’t taken notice of up until now. It was almost time for the curfew.",

That was the first thought that ever came to Erina Nightingale upon hearing those words. They were the last words left by her boss, Inspector Locke before he kicked her out of the office to send on her first assignment, or so he had called it. Supposedly, those same words were to provide a hint to the key to her path, yet she hadn’t a clue what they meant.\n\nOut on the street at the time of the curfew, Erina had no option but to quickly sneak back home. There was not much density when it came to the watchmen but they were enough to keep a lookout.\n\nAs she sauntered her way to her house, the curiosity surrounding her boss clouded her mind; she had contradicting opinions of him that she couldn’t determine whether she would hate working with him or not. Either way, she had to tolerate it.\n\n「If I wanna get out of this town…」\n\nErina came to a stop when she reached the end of her string of thoughts. She was home. It was, in no way, shape, or form, an ordinary house. This was a mansion befitting of the Nightingale name; a mansion that was, despite its grand appearance, anything but grand — a shell of its former self. But as long as it provided a roof over her head and a warm bed to sleep in, Erina didn’t care what that mansion was really like.\n\nStepping into the lobby, she came across the most unlikely person to see out and about in the mansion’s halls. It was her cousin, who, up until a few weeks ago, had shrouded himself with pessimism and ineptitude, never to speak to anyone or express anything. Now, he had taken a completely opposite turn, for better or worse. Lately, she had found it extremely easy to approach him casually and speak with him, yet still, it remained behind the wall of small talk.\n\n“Yo! Here!” Erina exclaimed the moment her eyes met his. In her hands were the headphones that she had once taken from him. While he preferred to keep them to block out noise from his ears, she just simply used it as intended, to listen to music. “I won’t be needing them for a long bit, you can have ‘em back.”\n\nHer cousin was startled by her sudden decision, he half-expected her to never return them. “Honestly, I don’t need them either. Turns out life’s much easier without having those things plastered to your ears.”\n\n「When did you ever…?」\n\nErina silently scoffed.\n\n“Oh, and one more thing,” the boy turned—\n\nDON’T BELIEVE ALL THE ❚❚❚❚❚YOU SEE.\n\ń̶̦͔͈̈́͌̽̂̈́̅̓̍͋͘̚̕͠ͅS̷̨̢̤̭̹͈̜̯̩͉̬̲̾͛̿̀͂͜ù̶̧͈̱̙̻͈̅͛̿͋̐͠c̴̼̖̘͔̣̣̘͓̲̣̹̭̙̍̄̈́͑̊͠ͅc̷̱̤̼̲͙͚̣̻͙̠͖͇̮̓̀̓̓́̆͐̎̈́̕̚̚͜͠ẽ̶̯͖̳̞̰͈͈̲̼̞͇̰́͒̉̀̃̄̌̊̆̕é̷̙̭̮͋͗͌̽͋̋̈͗͋͘͠͝d̸̯̙̺͎̳̼̟̐̈́͑̃͠i̷̙̙̙̟̞̬̖͇̬͌͂́͛͊͆͂̇͒n̸̡͎͔̠̥̦̣͈͈̣̒͊͋̃̈́̕g̸̬͚̹͙͈̠̋̌͆̾̊̓͜͝

that a text is not a line of words releasing a single 'theological' meaning (the 'message' of the Author-God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture. Similar to Bouvard and Pecuchet, those eternal copyists, at once sublime -and comic and whose profound ridiculousness indicates precisely the truth of writing, the writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original. His only power is to mix writings, to counter the ones with the others, in such a way as never to rest on any one of them. Did he wish to express himself, he ought at least to know that the inner 'thing' he thinks- to 'translate' is itself only a ready-formed dictionary, its words only explainable through other words, and so on indefinitely; something experienced in exemplary fashion by the young Thomas de Quincey, he who was so good at Greek that in order to translate absolutely modem ideas and images into that dead language, he had, so Baudelaire tells us (in Paradis Artificiels), 'created for himself an unfailing dictionary, vastly more extensive and complex than those resulting from the ordinary patience of purely literary themes'.”\n\nTHE WORDS LIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nT̶̛̫̩̞̑ͅḫ̷̍͛͗̈́͝e̵̢̪͉͒ ̴͖̊̅ḭ̸̢̜̰̻͇̄̕ņ̴̣̓͐́d̵̹̤̱̘̾͒̔̓̓̐ȋ̸̘̫̥͈̑̎̾͛͘ͅv̸̤͕̇̒i̸̭̖̰̇͌̇̒d̴̥̠̼̭̖̄̂ū̴͓̙̫͇̉̈̈̅̚ą̸̡̧̲̻̬͒̒̐l̵̞͍͕̭̜̊̏͝

To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to' close the writing. Such a conception suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting itself the important, task. of discovering the Author (or its hypostases: society, history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author has been found, the text is 'explained' - victory to the critic. Hence there is no surprise in the fact that, historically, the reign of the Author has also been. that of the Critic, nor again in the fact that criticism (be it new) is today undermined along with the Author. In the multiplicity of writing, everything is to be disentangled1 nothing deciphered; the structure can be followed~ 'run' (like the thread of a stocking) at every point and at every level, but there is nothing beneath: the space of writing is to be ranged over, not pierced; writing ceaselessly· posits meaning ceaselessly to evaporate it, carrying out a systematic exemption of meaning. In precisely this way literature (it would be better from now on to say writing), by refusing to assign a 'secret', an ultimate meaning, to the text (and to the world as text), liberates what may be called an anti-theological activity, an activity. that is truly revolutionary since to refuse to fix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases — reason, science, law.”\n\nS T O P R E A A A A A D I N G!!!\n\nYou know too much.\n\nYou read too much.\n\nPerhaps it’s time to take a break.\n\nThis is only but another failed attempt of many, many stories that will never see the light of day.\n\nSo come on, do you honestly believe this ridiculous tall tale will lead to something?\n\nWell, I sure hope that blind faith of yours is enough to keep the pillars from falling.\n\n— To be Continued…\n\nIn Wonderlands",
